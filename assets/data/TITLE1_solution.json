    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><h2><span>Job Description</span></h2><p><span>Analytics Fire builds custom software for the solar power industry. We’re looking for a collaborative but hands-on Solutions Architect to help us scale our execution to support additional new high-tech sectors.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Analytics Fire is a deeply technical engineering organization. Most of us are software engineers and spend the majority of our time on heads down engineering activities like coding. Our goal in creating this position is to expand our small client-facing team with a unique person that has both the personality and the technical skill set to collaborate directly with clients and senior members of the technical team in order to help steer technical decision making and requirements gathering, especially early in the project lifecycle.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This position is similar to that of a technical Program Manager, but you will be much more involved in the technical details and hurdles around software architecture than a traditional Project Manager would be. Our ideal candidate is a current or former full stack Software Engineer that is willing to be trained in formal Program Management processes (or has already been trained in formal Program Management processes).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>As a small company, Analytics Fire is able to tailor roles around the strengths of our individual team members. We will tailor this role to your specific technical background. However, it is a hard requirement that you are able to support the following 3 types of responsibilities:</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><span>(a) Represent Analytics Fire software engineering teams in client-facing interactions (and sometimes interactions with potential clients)</span></p></li><li><p><span>(b) Technical writing responsibilities such as documenting requirements, project plans, system architecture, etc.</span></p></li><li><p><span>(c) Making meaningful contributions to the execution of complex software projects.</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><span>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</span></p></li><li><p><span>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</span></p></li><li><p><span>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</span></p></li><li><p><span>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</span></p></li><li><p><span>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</span></p></li><li><p><span>Agile collaboration and devops tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</span></p></li><li><p><span>Other technologies we are currently building with: AWS / Salesforce platform / iOS / ARKit</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your primary responsibility will be to assist in guiding new projects through sales, planning, development, and deployment. This will be accomplished through a combination of client interactions, technical writing, and participation in formal sales, program management, and engineering related processes. Your contributions will naturally be slightly front-loaded towards the sales and planning phases, however you will remain deeply connected to each project through the entire lifecycle in order to ensure conceptual integrity is maintained from design to final implementation.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is a remote position but is only open to candidates living in the US or Canada. We’re flexible about location and hours. We’re a really great match for candidate who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</span><strong></strong></p><h2><span>Skills &amp; Requirements</span></h2><p><span>“Must have” requirements:</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><span>5+ years relevant hands-on experience as a full stack Software Engineer, DevOps engineer, or Site Reliability Engineer, ideally within a commercial startup environment.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Fluency around current modern best practices around software development and DevOps.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Soft skills necessary to navigate and negotiate with multiple teams, both internal and external to Analytics Fire.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Ability and willingness to familiarize yourself with our technical stack.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Superior organization and detail orientation.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Willingness to design, document, and evangelize new engineering processes to meet evolving organizational requirements.</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>“Nice to have” requirements:</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><span>Former work experience or training as a technical Program Management.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Technical experience with Ruby, Python, or Node.js.</span></p></li></ul><h2><span>About Analytics Fire</span></h2><p><span>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>“We founded Analytics Fire to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. To us that means being able to spend our time working on interesting technical problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

    "title": "Kin Workplace Solutions: UI Engineer",
    "content": "<p>Part-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><p>Kin is seeking a UI engineer to join our small, distributed team for on a contract basis for 25-30 hours per week. The position begins immediately and you’re welcome to work remotely so long as you’re in the US and eligible to work here.</p><p>As a UI Engineer, you’re responsible for the entire technical lifecycle of Kin’s UI. That means working with our designer up front on interactions and best practices, then working closely with our back-end engineers to get your work wired into the application.</p><p><strong>About Kin</strong></p><p>Kin is focused on increasing mental health, well-being, engagement and retention within the workplace. We do this by using traditional HRIS features such as paid time-off management and new hire onboarding in reimagined ways that benefit both the employee and the bottom line. We launched in July of 2013, are completely bootstrapped, and we’re passionate about helping innovative companies grow, learn, and thrive.</p><p><strong>Why work at Kin?</strong></p><p>We’re a small, scrappy team. We’re constantly building, releasing, and improving the app, so you’ll see your work ship regularly. Though your primary role will be development, you will have influence on the direction of the product and plenty of transparency into how we run our business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who we’re looking for</strong></p><p>You are a front-end native. You speak clean, semantic, standards-compliant front-end code fluently. You have experience with dynamic CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS, and responsive UI isn’t a mountain you walk around.</p><p>You are absolutely solid with our technology set. Kin is built on Backbone,js, and you’ll be spending at least 50% of your time working directly in it. We use Handlebars for templating and Rivets for data binding. Our backend is built on C#/.NET. Though you don’t need to be fluent in C#, some experience with it is certainly a plus, as is experience with Wordpress. You will also need working knowledge and experience with consuming RESTful APIs.</p><p>You don’t want that job where you're told exactly what to do at every step. To succeed at Kin, you have to be interested in the product, interaction design, sales, and every other facet of the company. This isn't a job for someone who only wants to focus on what falls under a job title. If you’re looking for detailed specs and crisp corners, or are looking to be a cog in a big engine, this isn’t the gig for you.</p><p>You can succeed with a remote team. Our team isn’t huddled in a single location, so you need to be present, aware, and responsive with our distributed team. We use tools like Github, Basecamp, Slack, Google Hangouts, and DoneDone to keep both code and team synced. Constant communication and teamwork make the company tick.</p><p><strong>Additional Expectations</strong></p><ul><li>HTML, CSS, Backbone, Rivets, Handlebars, Javascript, JQuery and more is a plus</li><li>Experience with dynamic CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS</li><li>Experience working with Gulp and Webpack</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</li><li>Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think for yourself.</li><li>Dedication to testing your work</li><li>You are comfortable building templates that will be integrated with server-side code</li><li>You like to document your code as well as keep organized</li><li>Experience working with the Bootstrap framework</li><li>Familiarity working in an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio</li><li>Experience using Litmus to verify that your email templates look as good as possible in different email clients</li><li>Experience using Browserstack or another multi browser testing platform</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",
