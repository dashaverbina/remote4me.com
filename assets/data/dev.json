The ability to take lead on projects falling under your responsibility is paramount. While we do not use a strict Agile methodology, you must be comfortable working closely with the rest of the company to ensure an iterative process. We require a basic working proficiency in the written and spoken English language, and the ability to travel to the United States 1-4 times a year for team meet-ups.</p><p>Much as we believe in internet privacy for all, we do not discriminate in who we choose to be part of our team.

No, backbone.js is not this week's hottest JS framework, but that's because these apps have been used and enhanced over the last 3 years in production. They've stood the test of time. But we are using the latest tooling alongside - ES6, webpack, less, nightwatch.js etc to make development as clean as possible.</p><p>Are you passionate about efficient client-side performance and robust, scalable platforms? Do you understand the underlying principles of JS (and haven't just built a simple Angular app)? We're adding to our team to build out our Javascript clients for our API-driven microservice retail platform of 18 loosely coupled services. It’s in production, supporting multiple brands and driving millions of dollars of revenue every month from US sales.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with a globally distributed team of 65.

Sure, we can list the latest set of technologies that we use, but that is a given. What's more interesting is how they are used - the design, the architecture, the approach to solving business problems. And we do that across multiple clients - each and every one we're excited to work with.</p><p>Because we believe in constant learning and exploring - whether that’s a new skill, a new role, or a new way of seeing.&nbsp; And because we've found that we learn the most when we take on new challenges as a team.&nbsp; We’re proud that people love working with us (and still have lives outside of work).

Nog meer dan skills en ervaring waarderen we je passie voor technologie en in dit geval voor Android in het bijzonder. We horen graag van je waarom je van programmeren en/of Android houdt, waarom jij dit doet en hoe je denkt ons te kunnen helpen met onze Android projecten.</p><p>Wij zijn een remote team wat betekent dat je veelal vanuit huis zult werken. Uiteraard bezoek je regelmatig een klant, en 1 keer in de 2 weken hebben we een gezamelijke 'coworking' day. Ons team bevindt zich voornamelijk in Nederland, we hebben collega's in vrijwel alle provincies.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Egeniq            </h2>            <div><p>Bij Egeniq bouwen we aan apps voor diverse platformen. We doen dat met een team van&nbsp;iets meer dan 20 ontwikkelaars. We houden van technische uitdagingen, onze apps kenmerken zich door een groot aantal users, integraties met diverse backends en vooruitstrevende designs. Op een enkele uitzondering na worden&nbsp;onze apps native ontwikkeld.</p><p>Ondanks dat we remote werken zijn we een hecht team. Naast onze 2-wekelijkse coworking days waarbij we met zijn allen samen komen, zitten we dagelijks op Slack en hebben we dagelijkse (online) standup meetings.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Passionate colleagues                            </div>                            <div>                                 Unlimited vacation days                            </div>                            <div>                                 Freedom                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible work hours                            </div>                            <div>                                 Conference visits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Co-working days                            </div>                            <div>                                 No sales people!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Never stop learning                            </div>                    ",

We’re Action Verb.</p><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower organizations worldwide.</p><p>Our products include&nbsp;<a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and&nbsp;<a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><p>Our company consists of 15 (but growing to 19 by the end of the year) full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p><strong>Our Success Strategy</strong></p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We Practice Holacracy</strong></p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of&nbsp;<a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong>&nbsp;As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE<span>→</span></a></p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that&nbsp;<strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</p><p><strong>Design Skills We’re Looking For</strong></p><p>This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.</p><p><strong>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) design</li><li>Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles</li><li>Solid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).</li><li>Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.</li><li>History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li></ul><p><strong>Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history</strong>&nbsp;of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.</p><p>We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.</p><p><strong>Some of Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><p><strong>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills.</strong>&nbsp;We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.</p><p><strong>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire.</strong>&nbsp;We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</p><p><strong>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work.</strong>&nbsp;Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.&nbsp;<a href='https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb' rel='nofollow'>Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</a></p><p><strong>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</p><p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p><p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs' rel='nofollow'>READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p><p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p><p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p><p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Ready To Apply?</strong></p><p>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you,&nbsp;<strong>please apply</strong>.</p><p>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?</li><li>How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs?

We’re revolutionising the apps which are used by both large enterprises and small businesses around the world. We’ve operated as a remote-working team since we founded the company and are looking for talented&nbsp;self-starters to join us. You can work from home or a shared workspace of your choosing.&nbsp;</p><p>Our team is mainly based in the UK and we're&nbsp;ideally looking for applicants who can also work from here.&nbsp;If you need to fit work hours around other commitments,&nbsp;that’s ok, and we trust that you can manage your own&nbsp;time effectively. We&nbsp;communicate using Slack, frequent video calls, and occasional in-person&nbsp;meet-ups (3-4 times per year). We're proud of both the team we’ve created and what we’ve achieved so far. We’re punching above our weight and are expanding our team to achieve even more.</p><p>We’re still a relatively small team. We’re all good at what we do and enjoy working together. You’ll have autonomy and respect from day one. No regulations or hierarchy, just a lot of interesting and challenging work to get done. You’ll work on our React Native mobile apps, so we’re looking for people who have extensive experience of Javascript and React. If you know React but not React Native, we think you’ll pick it up pretty quickly. Knowledge of Redux, Flow, GraphQL, native modules, C++ is a bonus.</p><p>The most important skill to us is being able to pick up new concepts and technologies rapidly. Ideally, you're the sort of person who has been programming from an early age, thrives on new challenges, is passionate about technology, takes pride in finding elegant solutions to difficult problems, and has a record of open source project involvement.&nbsp;We hope to find individuals full of energy and enthusiasm, with an eye for detail &amp; good design. We’re very open to new ideas, and our most recent joiners have already introduced new tools &amp; techniques&nbsp;to the team.</p><p>Axsy is well-funded&nbsp;and has a great opportunity to grow &amp; succeed.

As Intelligent Editing’s employee number four, you’ll have a wide set of responsibilities and the opportunity to contribute across as much of the business as interests you. That might include developing the next phase of our website; transforming our software (PerfectIt) to a SaaS model; or developing new products that will amaze anyone who thinks proofreading must be done manually.</p><p>You’ll work with a wide array of technologies (some of which you probably won’t be familiar with when joining). So a desire and ability to learn new tools is essential. We’re looking for a self-starter who will work on both new development and help modernise our existing codebase. You’ll be working directly with the founder &amp; CEO, as well as our Chief Engineer, to develop the tools that will allow the company to grow in the long term.</p><p>From the first day, you’ll be given a lot of responsibility, so you must be able to work and get things done independently. Although the core role is development, you shouldn’t be afraid to pitch in where needed (including admin, sales and support). In return, you’ll become well versed in a full set of skills valuable to any (or your own) startup.</p><p><strong>Duties and Responsibilities</strong></p><p>You will:</p><ul><li>Develop apps for online Office and add-ons for Google Docs</li><li>Contribute to the development of the next version of PerfectIt</li><li>Redesign our internal word usage databases</li><li>Improve our website</li><li>Work on e-commerce</li><li>Put in place unit tests and quality control mechanisms to improve our codebase.</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Intelligent Editing            </h2>            <div><p>Intelligent Editing launched in 2009. We’re not going to be the next Uber, and we don’t want to be. We like being small and profitable with a great team. We believe in steady growth, quality service and producing an excellent product.</p><p>We produce software that works with English-language documents. Our flagship software, PerfectIt, is an add-in for MS Word that finds mistakes that spelling and grammar checkers won’t find, such as consistency errors and style issues. The English language is a beast! And working to automate proofreading tasks for English is one of the most challenging and interesting aspects of our work.</p><p>We’re at the forefront of proofreading/editing technologies. We were among the first companies to produce apps for Office and add-ons for Google Docs, and we have plans to do more development in these environments as the next generation of word processors takes off.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p><strong>Flexible Working</strong></p><p>We have a team call every day between 3pm and 5pm (UK time). All other hours are flexible. If you produce great work, we don’t care when you do it.</p><p><strong>Remote Working</strong></p><p>Candidates should be based in the United Kingdom. Intelligent Editing has no offices, so candidates should be equipped to work from home.</p><p><strong>A Life Beyond Programming</strong></p><p>We believe that it’s impossible for developers to work more than forty hours per week and sustain quality. Our founder is a workaholic, but he doesn’t want others doing that! So we work forty hours per week, and we don’t do overtime.</p><p>We’re sympathetic to the demands of parenting and welcome applications from experienced professionals who need the flexibility that life with children demands.</p><p><strong>A Stake in Success</strong></p><p>We offer equity in the business so you will own your success.

We’re Action Verb.</p><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that Engineering and Marketing professionals use to power their products and services.</p><p>Our products include <a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and <a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><p>Our company consists of 8 full time USA-based Engineers, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America. We’re looking to grow our family by one or two faces.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of <a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong> As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about our Holacracy practice.</a></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that <strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about Open Book Management.</a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four quarterly meetings that are hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, and Detroit.</p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. <strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, <strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong> Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully Remote Company!

We’re flexible, so even if you primarily work with C# or any other languages, but have experience developing web applications, send us your CV! :)</p><p>Although based in Australia, Avant8 has presence in the US and leverages it to deal with domestic brands and investors, specializing in turning around their distressed digital assets. Our team creates innovative solutions that work well under pressure allowing for new business models to tested rapidly in any market.</p><p>We’re looking for A-players, and part of that involves autonomy. You will be assigned tasks, both small and large, and a general time frame, but given the autonomy and freedom to schedule your own daily tasks as long as you complete what needs to get done. We understand and respect that you know development better than we do and it’s not our place to call unnecessarily strict or irrational deadlines and ways of completing tasks. This may be a good place to add that you should, when applying, mention in the cover letter your favorite food and, if you’re feeling ambitious, include a picture: this is to weed out applicants who mindlessly apply en masse to listings.</p><p>Given the above mentioned autonomy and freedom, you will be expected to debrief with a daily summary of what was accomplished, problems you ran into, what’s planned for the coming days, and maybe a joke or two. :)</p><p>We are a fun, friendly, and closely knit team, and although geographically distant, we have a strong work ethos and communicate regularly allowing for a very friendly and efficient work environment. Being a part of a new division within an established company, you get the best of both worlds in terms of job security and company culture. We work hard and expect the same from all of our team members.</p><p>We work hard, but we also play hard. You should come with a great sense of humor and a smile on your face, because you’ll have a few laughs and enjoy your time working with us.

You can see our work at <a href='https://www.omgyes.com' rel='nofollow'>OMGYES.com</a></p><p>We get a huge amount of positive feedback from the press all over the world, and foremost from our users, who tell us how much it has helped their relationships and sex lives. It's been a wonderful, fulfilling journey.</p><p>What we need you to do<br>----------------------------<br>We're always working to keep our busy website (13m req/day) highly available, with minimal latency. We need you to design and implement new features that can scale accordingly. You will be making architectural decisions regarding data storage (database, NoSQL, client-side), content delivery (especially video across a wide range of devices), and gaining user insights through analytics.</p><p>Our users are distributed globally; we need to ensure we can serve a media-rich site in many languages to people all over the world. We need to support purchasing in a range of currencies, using different payment methods, with a careful eye to security.</p><p>Our backend was designed before launch. While it performs quite well, our site has evolved quite a bit since those days. We also have a new season of content that is in production. We've started a new project to build a more appropriate system, starting with season two content, and we want you to work with our front-end team to develop it, using modern best practices.</p><p>Who we're looking for<br>---------------------<br>You are completely at home in a server environment; both in the codebase and in the database. When someone proposes a new site feature, you've already assessed its impact on performance, designed a database schema, and half-architected the solution by the time they finish their pitch. As a full-stack developer, your emphasis is on the backend. You know the ins and outs of OWASP. You believe that design begins with data modeling, and your goal is instant gratification for all consumers of your APIs.</p><p>And, you are a scientist. You measure everything and make that data accessible, so you can make good decisions. You can frame improvements in terms of hypothesis and result, rather than conjecture.</p><p>You have more than 5 years of industry experience.</p><p>Technologies you should know<br>----------------------------<br>(In approximate order of importance, descending, not comprehensive!)</p><p>- MySQL / PostgreSQL<br>- Java (Spring Boot)<br>- Python / Ruby / Node.js (and your favorite web frameworks in each)<br>- Couchbase / Redis<br>- Varnish (and general principles of caching)<br>- AWS S3, EC2, Cloudfront (especially signed URLs)<br>- RESTful API design<br>- Git Flow<br>- Elasticsearch / Kibana / Logstash (self-hosted)<br>- Linux command line<br>- Video content delivery</p><p>Interested?<br>-----------<br>Send us your resume and a few words about why our project in particular interests you.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>(Included in job description)</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About OMGYes            </h2>            <div><p>OMGYes conducts large-scale scientific research into taboo topics like sexual pleasure.

Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.</p><p>We don’t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it’s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it’s all open for anyone to suggest.</p><p><strong>OUR ENGINEERING VALUES</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Move smart</strong>: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).</li><li><strong>Distribute knowledge</strong>: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.</li><li><strong>Leave code better than you found it</strong>: because we constantly raise the bar.</li><li><strong>Unity makes strength</strong>: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.</li><li><strong>Always improve</strong>: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you’ve done.</li></ul><p><strong>MOBILE AT HEETCH</strong></p><p>Our app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design.

We aren’t big on formal requirements in the credentials department; rather, we want to see <strong>what you’ve worked on</strong>. &nbsp;Show us a project you’re proud of that you shipped and we’ll start the conversation from there. But let’s not kid ourselves -- you should absolutely come without “training wheels” ;).</li></ul><ul><li>… you have excellent design sensibilities and a firm grasp of HTML5 / CSS / SASS, ui toolkits like bootstrap, and probably design tools like Sketch.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>… you’re pretty opinionated about your design choices and can easily articulate/defend your design decisions/rationale when asked “Why did you <em>&lt;insert observation that challenges your design&gt;</em> ?”</li></ul><ul><li>… you have solid <strong>AngularJS</strong> front-end development chops. &nbsp;But, because you love javascript frameworks in general, you’ve played around with -- and probably are opinionated about -- other frameworks like React, Aurelia, Ember, etc. &nbsp;And speaking of opinions, what are your thoughts on Angular 2/4 &lt;-&gt; AngularJS (1.6)?<br><br></li><li>...you should be able to design, architect &amp; implement front-end solutions that reflect your particular problem-solving approach (...and you’ll probably be solving a problem that was based on a story that you yourself were instrumental in either eliciting or refining).<br><br></li><li>… you’re a natural <a href='https://www.ideou.com/pages/design-thinking' rel='nofollow'>Design Thinker</a>. &nbsp;Therefore, you’re good at leveraging your empathy to investigate both known and ambiguous aspects of a complex, convoluted story (lots of these in healthcare!) in order to discover hidden parameters and open alternative paths which may lead to the “real” story. &nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>… &nbsp;you have an admirable understanding of the principles behind a good RESTful API design.

At Dorsata, we are fervent (rabidly obsessive, really) believers in frequent, high-touch interactions with our involved, loyal customer base, who drives our roadmap. &nbsp;Believe me when I tell you that you’re going to be on a first name basis with many of our customers -- there’s a whole Slack channel full of’em that just can’t wait to meet you. &nbsp;</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Dorsata            </h2>            <div><p>Dorsata’s clinical workflow intelligence platform is designed to work both top of and inside of the existing electronic health records (<a href='https://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/faqs/what-electronic-health-record-ehr' rel='nofollow'>EHRs</a>) that our customers use. The <a href='https://www.dorsata.com' rel='nofollow'>ACOG Prenatal Record</a> -- our flagship product for the Dorsata platform -- is an AngularJS/Rails SPA designed collaboratively with women’s health providers to <em>support</em> the way that they work &amp; think -- not <em>tell</em> them how to work &amp; think (or add additional clerical burdens to their already-busy day). We want practitioners of women’s health to feel like they are using a piece of software not only designed for them, but by them. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>More About Us : Location, Location, Location...</strong></p><p>Dorsata is located in Washington, DC.

If we move forward, the next step will be a more in depth on-site meeting with us that dives into some problem solving (how would you do this? / what do you think about XYZ?) and some Show &amp; Tell (a project you've worked on before).

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the day-to-day realities of programming.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75K-95K (Mid-Level) and $95-115K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>I know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>If you are local, we do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

A typical project will involve:</p><ul><li><strong>Recon</strong>: Digging into the functionality, design, and implementation of the software system or device.</li><li><strong>Probing</strong>: Searching for implementation weaknesses which could indicate a security issue. This is a combination of tools that we use, tools that we build, and manual probing. For device projects this can include firmware extraction, analysis, and hardware interfacing.</li><li><strong>Extending</strong>: Now that you've found a weakness... how far can you extend your access into the system?</li><li><strong>Writing</strong>: Now that you've hacked your way in you'll need to write-up your findings and work with the developers to make sure they understand what the problem is and how to fix it.</li></ul><p>If you enjoy puzzles and technical variety you'll find this job very enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Who are we looking for?</strong></p><ul><li><em>You do not need to have information security experience.</em> If you've got the right technical background and problem solving skills we can train you in the dark arts of infosec.</li><li>People who enjoy writing code, solving problems with code, and learning how computers work at a fundamental level.</li><li>This is not a &quot;travel every week&quot; type of consultant.

We believe in engaging with the broader security community to stay on top of our game.

We always enjoy the endorphin rush from finally exploiting &quot;that bug&quot;, but we make a long-term effort to master both technical and consulting skills.<br><br>We are not chained to our computers. We like to stand up and get outside. We trail run, play music, ride bikes, and enjoy well-rounded lives.

Social trading takes the activity of &quot;investing&quot; -- which previously happened only&nbsp;in private, like some kind of embarrassing biological process&nbsp;-- and brings it out into the sunshine so that other people can watch and benefit.</p><p>On Collective2's web site, you can find traders and investors that you like and admire, and follow along with them in your own brokerage account. Alternately, if you're a good trader, you can attract followers (and earn extra money doing so).</p><p>So Collective2's business touches a lot of interesting areas: finance, trading, automation, algorithms, big-data, risk analysis.</p><p><strong>Remote Only</strong></p><p>Collective2 is a &quot;distributed&quot; company - no central office, no cubicles, no pointy-headed managers. We are a team of men and women working together, full-time, from homes and coworking facilities all over the world.</p><p>We are a small company. We try to keep things on a human (and humane) scale. No politics, no corporate B.S.</p><p>Because we are small, every software developer has tremendous responsibility. We'll keep you challenged and happy.</p><p>And finally:</p><p>Be honest with yourself. The idea of working remotely sounds appealing, but it drives some percentage of the population bat-shit crazy. If you need proximity to warm human flesh, a foosball table, or a communal water cooler, this position probably isn't&nbsp;for you. But if you want to live anywhere&nbsp;you like in the world, dream of giving up your commute, and like the idea of working from&nbsp;the quiet and peace of your home, it might be perfect.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Competitive salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 Live anywhere, work anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 No commute!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Independent working environment                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flat structure                            </div>                    ",

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developers who want to add to Kibana and X-Pack?

Their progress in the first year is amazing.” - One of our investors</em></p><p>Retailers use archaic, old systems that don’t work (think fax machines and voicemails). We’re replacing the core operational processes with a modern platform that our customers love. Help us transform a $4.4 trillion industry and improve the way millions of people work. Major retailers are already using Zipline every day, but there is so much more to do!</p><p><em>“I think I just shed a tear. This is great!” – One of our Fortune 100 customers</em></p><p>We’re looking for you, our first mobile developer. There is a lot of opportunity to set a solid foundation for our mobile app and we want to bring on the right person to make that happen. You will be working closely with our design team and our engineering team to deliver a set of high quality mobile apps. We’ll help you build a team as necessary to make sure you can deliver on the goals we set together.</p><p>You get to start with a mostly clean slate. Deep understanding of at least one mobile framework is a must, and previous experience with Ruby on Rails would be a nice addition so that we can move quickly. We currently only have a simple iOS app in the app store and are actively deciding on the best way to deliver great mobile apps. You will be central to those conversations and influence the direction that we take.</p><p>We like what Basecamp has been doing to balance hybrid architecture:&nbsp;https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-3-for-ios-hybrid-architecture-afc071589c25</p><p>You will help define our culture through hiring decisions, process design, and your personality.

For a full time hire, we’re looking anywhere in the US or Canada.</p><p>Our team is small but strong and we ship things that have tangible impact. Being small, you get to impact more than the product.</p><p>We have a flexible vacation policy, full extended benefits, and a flexible work week depending on your needs. We also cover certain education costs and things you need to purchase to be able to work comfortably. In short, we all work together to make your work life great. :)</p></div></div><div></div></div></div></div>",

As a member joining the group, you will have the chance to improve technologies used by millions of JavaScript developers and over one billion end-users throughout the world.</p><p>In this position, you will implement language features, improve code generation, write conformance tests, and do whatever else it takes to improve JavaScript developers' experience. We welcome all those with a proficiency in C/C++ to apply, especially those with an interest in dynamic or functional programming languages or web technologies. Past experience in systems programming such as compilers, operating systems, embedded development or web browser internals is a plus, but there are many valid starting points.</p><p><strong>Work environment</strong></p><p>Igalia is a worker-owned, employee-run company with 16 years of experience building open source software in a wide range of exciting fields. We work on the core of such widely-deployed projects as the WebKit and Blink browser engines, the Mesa graphics drivers, the V8 and JavaScriptCore language runtimes, and the GStreamer multimedia toolkit. We are also at the cutting edge of high-speed software-defined networking with our work on Snabb Switch. At Igalia, you can develop your career in a unique environment, participating equally in the management of the company via our democratic, consensus-based assembly structure.</p><p>Igalia is a remote-friendly working environment, enabling employees all over the world to participate fully in the company culture. Our team includes employees based on Asia, Europe and America, spanning both timezones and cultures.</p><p>One of the core principles of Igalia is equality, so we feel a deep and continual obligation to acknowledge and counter the structural discrimination that permeates our industry and our world. In a practical sense this means that we have a permanent diversity commission that helps to shape company policy and that maintain a safe and inclusive work environment. We also feel that one of the best ways to accomplish these goals is to grow and maintain the diversity of Igalia itself. We welcome applicants regardless of their age, disability, gender, race, marital status, religion, sexual orientation or whatever type of systemic discrimination that they have faced.</p><p>Send us your CV, accompanied by a brief cover letter by filling the form below.

You understand idempotency, error handling, race conditions, and you've witnessed first-hand what can go wrong when careful planning doesn't go into system architecture.</div><div><br></div><div>You write unit tests with RSpec, and request specs too. But you don't overcomplicate the codebase in the name of faster tests.</div><div><br></div><div>You love writing documentation so that customers, teammates, and future-you don't have to use those darn brains to figure-out already solved problems.</div><div><br></div><div>And you're not afraid to hop on the phone with leads/customers to help ensure they're integration/experience is going smoothly.</div><div><br></div><div><b>We're at our best when we're solving hard problems for customers, and you take pride in being a part of that.</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>--</b></div><div><b>Your responsibilities at Churn Buster:</b></div><ul><li>Add new payment processor integrations</li><li>Improve existing integrations</li><li>Simplify/speed up onboarding for all integrations</li><li>Work with our customers' engineering teams when they need help</li><li>Write documentation regularly for recurring confusion points</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Requirements/Experience:</b></div><ul><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Sidekiq/Background workers</li><li>OOP/POROs</li><li>APIs</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Heroku/Review Apps</li><li>Git</li><li>RSpec</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Bonus Points:</b></div><ul><li>Payment-related APIs: Stripe, Braintree, etc</li><li>Sinatra</li><li>SQL (knowing when to not use ActiveRecord)</li><li>Component based Rails applications/Wisper</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>About the Job:</b></div><ul><li>Full-Time</li><li>100% Remote (US Pacific Time preferred, California even better - time zone is important since we'll be pairing frequently)</li><li>Unlimited Vacation</li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Email <a href='mailto:matt@churnbuster.io' rel='nofollow'>matt@churnbuster.io</a> and share why you think you're the perfect fit for the next chapter at Churn Buster.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you.

A few months ago our recruiting process was going well enough that we had a comment in our HN post from a candidate we'd passed on who was happy enough with the experience that they recommended us in the thread [1]. Last month, however we had the exact opposite experience. Two candidates commented about investing significant effort in the process, only to be ghosted [2].</p><p>I arrived at those comments too late to reply, so I'm using this month's post to apologize. I dug into what happened here and found that we did indeed drop the ball with a few candidates and failed to follow up. Certainly it wasn't our intent and doesn't reflect our values. We've audited the entire candidate pool and have reached out to anyone that fell through the cracks to properly close the loop.  I personally apologize for your poor experiences and the criticism is well deserved.</p><p>I also want to thank the people who commented. I think posting that kind of feedback warning others is an excellent way to keep other members of the community informed, and hold each-other accountable. In this case we've overhauled and streamlined our processes so that we're confident this won't happen again in the future.

Now we’re leveraging that market-leading position to help the biggest brands on the planet take on one of the largest opportunities ever in enterprise software: unifying the front office.</p><p>And we’re bringing the very best talent in the world together to get there.</p><p><strong>What You'll Do</strong></p><p>We are currently seeking a person with extensive development and consulting experience.  Full-stack software engineers with experience in a wide variety of technologies are preferred. It is imperative that you not only know your way around various front-end and back-end architectures, but can also walk a technical or non-technical customer through the process of integrating two business systems. </p><p>In this role you will be leading customer integration activities as well as rolling up your sleeves when it’s needed.</p><p><strong>What Are Your Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Consult with internal and external customers in a highly complex technical environment</li><li>Provide solutions using creative problem solving, technical expertise and strong understanding of underlying business requirements and best practices.</li><li>Write proof-of-concept applications using available SDKs and APIs</li><li>Research, design and implement solutions to highly ambiguous problems</li><li>Provided guidance to customers who are implementing solutions using the Sprinklr API.</li><li>Analyze API source code and assist product and documentation teams identifying gaps in the documentation.</li><li>Maintain knowledge of the Sprinklr application and architecture.</li><li>Work closely with the Product Support, Customer Success, Client Services and Development teams to resolve application issues and plan for changes, upgrades, enhancements and new customer provisioning.</li><li>Document operational procedures</li><li>Inspire, grow and lead junior consultants</li><li>Follow industry trends and developments to provide new ideas and recommendations on processes and products.</li></ul><p><strong>Who You Are &amp; What Makes You Qualified</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum of 6+ years of experience building scalable web based applications</li><li>Minimum of 3 years experience developing backend systems in Java</li><li>Solid understanding of web application security and vulnerabilities (such as the OWASP top 10 list).</li><li>Experience designing and consuming REST based API services.</li><li>Proficient in HTML, JavaScript (ES6), and/or CSS.</li><li>Familiar with source control management systems (git is preferred).</li><li>Experience with NoSql databases such as MongoDB and ElasticSearch</li><li>Experience with Message Queuing Systems such as Kafka</li><li>Experience with Javascript Frameworks such as Express, React, Redux</li><li>Experience with Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud</li><li>Experience with Docker, AWS, Azure and deployment strategies</li><li>Comfortable working in a UNIX environment.</li><li>Experience with Social Media and CRM Integrations</li></ul><p>While our strong preference is for this position to be in Austin TX, we recognize that great talent can be found all over and will consider remote work candidates from anywhere in the U.S.</p><p><strong>You know You're Successful if….</strong></p><p>You’re just as comfortable writing code as you are having a conversation with someone about writing code. The right person for this job will have extensive development experience but have more to offer than your average software engineer.</p><p>If you habitually analyze business processes and find yourself designing databases and writing APIs in your mind in order to make sense of a process you might be exactly the person we’re looking for.  </p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United States</p></dd>        </dl>",

We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything in this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!</p><p>As a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry. You will help us shape the digital guest experience for restaurant brands served by Olo. You will contribute to technology selection, architecture and user experience for our front-end applications.</p><p>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience building user interfaces that put users first and look and feel awesome to use</li><li>Deep knowledge of ES6/ES2015+ and one or more modern Javascript frameworks, with a preference for React or Ember</li><li>Demonstrable understanding of the full .NET web stack</li><li>Leadership experience that spans one or more aspects of technology selection, architecture and design oversight, and mentoring others</li><li>Superb problem solving skills with an emphasis on pragmatism, quality, and performance</li><li>Passion for learning new skills and technologies</li><li>Excellent collaboration skills</li><li>BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience</li><li>Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S.</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo reaches millions of consumers by powering mobile and online ordering for many of the country’s largest restaurant chains. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.</p><p>We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller.  We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!). Check out our culture map.</p><p>Olo is an equal opportunity employer and diversity is valued at our company. All applicants receive consideration for employment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United States</p></dd>        </dl>",

We’re Action Verb.</p><br><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower organizations worldwide.</p><br><p>Our products include&nbsp;<a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and&nbsp;<a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><br><p>Our company consists of 15 (but growing to 19 by the end of the year) full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America.</p><br><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><br><p><strong>Our Success Strategy</strong></p><br><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><br><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><br><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><br><p><strong>We Practice Holacracy</strong></p><br><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of&nbsp;<a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><br><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><br><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong>&nbsp;As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><br><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><br><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><br><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><br><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE<span>→</span></a></p><br><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that&nbsp;<strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><br><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT<span>→</span></a></p><br><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><br><p>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><br><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><br><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</p><br><p><strong>Design Skills We’re Looking For</strong></p><br><p>This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.</p><br><p><strong>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</strong></p><br><ul><br><li>Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) design</li><br><li>Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles</li><br><li>Solid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).</li><br><li>Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.</li><br><li>History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li><br></ul><br><p><strong>Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history</strong>&nbsp;of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.</p><br><p>We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.</p><br><p><strong>Some of Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><br><p><strong>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills.</strong>&nbsp;We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.</p><br><p><strong>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire.</strong>&nbsp;We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</p><br><p><strong>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work.</strong>&nbsp;Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.&nbsp;<a href='https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb' rel='nofollow'>Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</a></p><br><p><strong>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</p><br><p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p><br><p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><br><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs' rel='nofollow'>READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p><br><p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p><br><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><br><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><br><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><br><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p><br><p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p><br><p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p><br><p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</p><br><p><strong>Ready To Apply?</strong></p><br><p>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you,&nbsp;<strong>please apply</strong>.</p><br><p>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:</p><br><ul><br><li>Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?</li><br><li>How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs? Is there anything you would add or change?</li><br><li>Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?</li><br><li>Are you familiar with Holacracy? Any questions or concerns?</li><br><li>What’s lacking in your current work arrangement that we could improve?</li><br><li>What are your philosophies on design?</li><br><li>What does designing great software look like?</li><br></ul><br><p>We look forward to reading your letter!</p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

We're looking for an excellent Ruby developer to build out Baymard's custom-built Rails-based web platform.<br><br><strong>The Job</strong><br>In this position, you will have a lot of influence on the technical direction of the company since all Baymard employees are e-commerce UX researchers except one (Jamie, co-founder of the business, and the person you’ll be working most closely together with). It’s an opportunity to help envision and build the technical platform of a research company that, while it works with tech, isn't yet another app or web service. (Because of this we’re also more than happy to open-source our internal code and scripts because we don't make our money from code.)<br><br><strong>Requirements</strong><br>- We're looking for someone with strong programming skills since we want you to take charge / ownership of our tech platform.<br>- Since all of our current infrastructure is written in Ruby, it's a major plus if that's your choice of language too.<br>- Familiarity with JavaScript and CSS are a bonus, but not required.<br><br><em>Note: you must be fluent in English, comfortable working remotely via digital platforms and willing to do a few yearly travels for team meetups (expect 2-4 weeks of travel each year).</em><br><br><strong>Are We A Good Fit?</strong><br>If you’re looking for a chance to work on long-term goals rather than chasing monthly user growth targets, this will be a good match. We’re a business that has been profitable from day one and we really don’t care about temporarily spiking our user metrics in order to flip the company or impress VC investors. We’re much more interested in steady and sustainable improvements to our business – continually increasing the value we deliver to our customers (from which sustained increases in profitability organically follow). Since all of Baymard’s research is delivered through its website, your work will have an immediate and tangible impact on the company.<br><br>We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which many of our employees do). If you want to, you’re of course also welcome to work in our Copenhagen-based office.<br><br><strong>About Baymard</strong><br>Baymard Institute is a small independent web usability research organization, specialized in conducting large-scale generic usability studies of e-commerce sites. These studies are published as industry reports and benchmark databases at baymard.com (this site is a big part of the web platform you’ll be working on) – which is being used by thousands of web professionals, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.<br><br>You'll be working with a team of dedicated usability researchers conducting cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc.)?<br><br><strong>Apply</strong><br>If you’re interested in this position, please send the following to jamie+job@baymard.com (listed in order of importance):<br><br>- Samples of back-end code you’ve written.<br>- Samples of front-end code you’ve written (optional).<br>- Other information you find relevant (hobbies, interests, work experience, CV, ..).<br><br><em>Note: All applications and materials are kept strictly confidential. That said, open-source contributions are perfectly fine as code samples too – just send along / point us towards whatever “work” you feel best represents your skills.</em></p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

However, we recognise that not all companies allow such work, and absence of this will not be counted against your application.<br />* This is a permanent, salaried position. Salary will based on experience.<br />* No recruitment companies please.",

Or a front-end developer who knows Ruby?</p><p>Would you like to envision and develop the web platform for a team of dedicated usability researchers conducting cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc.)?</p><p>Then apply for the following full-time job at Baymard Institute – either working remotely or in Copenhagen, Denmark (or a mix!).</p><h3>About the Job</h3><p>Baymard Institute is a small independent web usability research organization, specialized in conducting large-scale generic usability studies of e-commerce sites. These studies are published as industry reports and benchmark databases at baymard.com (this site is a big part of the web platform you’ll be working on) – which is being used by thousands of web professionals, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.</p><p>In this position you will have a lot of influence on the technical direction of the company since all Baymard employees are e-commerce UX researchers except one (Jamie, co-founder of the business, and the person you’ll be working most closely together with). It’s an opportunity to help envision and build the technical platform of a company that works with tech but doesn’t sell it. (Because of this we’re also more than happy to open-source our internal code and scripts.)</p><p>If you’re looking for a chance to work on long-term goals rather than chasing monthly user growth targets, this will be a good match. We’re a business that has been profitable from day one and we really don’t care about temporarily spiking our user metrics in order to flip the company or impress VC investors. We’re much more interested in steady and sustainable improvements to our business – continually increasing the value we deliver to our customers (from which sustained increases in profitability organically follow). Since all of Baymard’s research is delivered through its website, your work will have an immediate and tangible impact on the company.</p><p>We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which many of our employees do). If you want to, you’re of course also welcome to work in our Copenhagen-based office.</p><p>Salary: in accordance with qualifications.</p><p>Start date: preferably before the end of 2017.</p><h3>Job Requirements</h3><p>You’re skills and interests must span from design to back-end coding. Strong skills in one area can compensate for a weaker side in other areas, but you’ll regularly be working across the spectrum of back-end programming, front-end code, and user interface design, and therefore must have basic skills in all these areas – and even more importantly: enjoy working in all of them!</p><p>Specifically, we’re looking for:</p><ul><li><strong>Back-end skills</strong> – basic programming chops is a requirement for this position, and solid back-end skills is considered a major plus. Familiarity with Ruby is a bonus, but by no means a necessity.</li><li><strong>Front-end skills</strong> – you should be confident in JavaScript and <span>CSS</span>, be able to appreciate concepts such as progressive enhancement, and care deeply about how all of these things tie together and how they impact the end-user experience.</li><li><strong>Design skills</strong> – while we’re definitely not looking for a graphic designer, you must be curious about design and how it shapes users’ perceptions, and enjoy thinking through and tweaking the user interfaces you’re building.</li><li><strong>Interest in UX and e-commerce</strong> is a bonus, but no experience or skills are necessary in this area as you’ll work with (and have the option to be trained by) the best in the business.</li><p></p></ul><p>We furthermore expect you to be fluent in english, comfortable working remotely via digital platforms and willing to do a few yearly travels for team meetups (expect 2-5 weeks of travel each year).</p><h3>Application</h3><p>If you’re interested in this position please send the following (listed in order of importance):</p><ol><li>Samples of back-end code you’ve written.</li><li>Samples of front-end code you’ve written.</li><li>Samples of user interfaces you’ve designed, been involved in designing, or helped implement (please indicate your level of involvement).</li><li>Other information you find relevant (hobbies, interests, work experience, CV, ..).</li></ol><p>Note: open-source contributions are perfectly fine as code samples – simply send along / point us towards whatever “work” you feel best represents your skills.</p><p>Deadline is October 13, 2017. However, we’ll review applications on an ongoing basis, so earlier applicants do have a better chance. All applications and materials are kept strictly confidential.</p><h3>How to apply</h3>",
