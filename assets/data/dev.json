Our software allows healthcare providers and patients to make better decisions faster.

We also have other large public and private exchange networks, as well as health plan exchanges in active deployment.</p><p>Our team is quite small, but all of us are technical people. We maintain a strong start-up/hacker culture. CareEvolution has partnered with a few large companies with relationships in all 50 states - and beyond - to supply a large portion of our sales and marketing efforts. &nbsp;Our stack is recognized by leading HIE industry analysts as the most technologically sophisticated HIE on the market - by a significant margin. &nbsp;Mention the word sesquipedalian in your employment application to have it processed quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>We are focused and execute very quickly. But we also have a lot of fun - biweekly visits to the bar, daily ping pong/foosball/darts games in the office, hackathons every eight weeks for pet projects, biannual company-wide get-togethers, board game nights, rock climbing nights, disc golf days... etc. We are also a very family-friendly organization. We have constant, active teleconference for all of our remote employees <strong>(all remote people must live somewhere in the US or Canada)</strong> - which comprise more than half of the CareEvolution team.</p><p>Check out our company page to the right,&nbsp;and visit <a title=&quot;http://letsfixhealthcare.com&quot; href='http://letsfixhealthcare.com' rel='nofollow'>http://letsfixhealthcare.com</a> for more information on what we do.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Management-less environment                            </div>                            <div>                                 Work from anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 Competitive Salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 401K &amp; Defined Benefit                            </div>                            <div>                                 Strong Partnerships                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flex Time                            </div>                            <div>                                 Hackathons every 8 weeks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Talented coworkers                            </div>                            <div>                                 Biweekly post-work get-togethers                            </div>                            <div>                                 This work actually matters                            </div>                    ",

Our engineers, no matter what level, never go hands off. We think it’s important to be close to the code and always be a contributor. We work with several different technologies, mostly on the Java stack. As a senior engineer, we’re looking for a breadth of experience in a lot of languages, and expertise in at least one: Java, Javascript, and Ruby are highest on our list. You should also be up to speed with frameworks like Spring, OSGI and Hibernate, and on practices like TDD and continuous integration.</li><li>Learning. Our engineering team is full of life-long learners. It’s important to stay up on our craft and always keep an eye on what’s next, and what’s best. Open Source contributions and pet projects are a way of life here, it’s not only about the day job. It’s important we learn from each other.</li><li>Problem solving. The problems we have to solve are mind boggling. Often times, we are challenged with doing something that no other company has done before. This takes critical thinking, root cause analysis and issue dissection by the team to come up with a best solution.</li><li>Mentoring. Teaching and coaching is an integral part of this role. Bringing your less experienced peers up to speed on best practices and new skills/languages is key.</li><li>Delivering. This takes a start-up mentality and a laser focus to get the highest quality products out the door here. We do not negotiate on the level of sophistication and quality we offer to our customers. You must be ready to manage competing priorities, pivot and adjust quickly, and always think the big picture.</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About DrFirst, Inc.            </h2>            <div><p>DrFirst is an innovative Health IT company that pioneers software solutions and services designed to optimize healthcare provider access to patient information, improve the doctor's clinical view of the patient at the time of care, and enable more effective, efficient administration and collaboration across a patient's circle of caregivers.

Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.</p><p>We don’t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it’s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it’s all open for anyone to suggest.</p><p><strong>OUR ENGINEERING VALUES</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Move smart</strong>: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).</li><li><strong>Distribute knowledge</strong>: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.</li><li><strong>Leave code better than you found it</strong>: because we constantly raise the bar.</li><li><strong>Unity makes strength</strong>: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.</li><li><strong>Always improve</strong>: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you’ve done.</li></ul><p><strong>MOBILE AT HEETCH</strong></p><p>Our app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for a great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: we are passionate about software architecture. We’ve built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough that we’ll be able to push forward what doing mobile programming means and we’ll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p><ul><li>Build new exciting features.</li><li>Solve challenging real-time synchronization problems.</li><li>Build a robust &amp; modern in-house framework, that will serve our app for next 4 years</li><li>Practise continuous refactoring and unit testing to constantly improve the codebase.</li><li>Create custom UI components (with Playground Driven Development)</li><li>Work on our great shiny redesign of the app.</li><li>Experimenting with various concepts (Coordinators/Flows, ReSwift)</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Great oral and written communication skills.</li><li>Speaking both French and English at a conversational level</li><li>At least 4-5 years of experience with both Objective C and Swift in production environments.</li><li>Experience with creating and supporting a widely used app</li><li>Strong mobile development culture.</li><li>You know how to make integration testing less painful (XCTests, FBSnapshots).</li><li>Strong understanding of the iOS SDK (UIKit, MapKit).</li><li>Ability to thrive in a startup environment.</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS POINTS</strong></p><ul><li>Contributions to open source projects.</li><li>Experience with RxSwift.</li></ul><p><strong>PERKS</strong></p><ul><li>Permanent contract</li><li>Stock.</li><li>Paid conference attendance/travel and periodic team meetups.</li><li>Heetch credits.</li><li>A Spotify subscription.</li><li>Work from anywhere you want.</li></ul>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Full remote (in Europe only) and flexible ways of working                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid conferences attendance/travel                            </div>                            <div>                                 Periodic team meetups                            </div>                            <div>                                 Stocks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Heetch credits                            </div>                    ",

The ability to take lead on projects falling under your responsibility is paramount. While we do not use a strict Agile methodology, you must be comfortable working closely with the rest of the company to ensure an iterative process. We require a basic working proficiency in the written and spoken English language, and the ability to travel to the United States 1-4 times a year for team meet-ups.</p><p>Much as we believe in internet privacy for all, we do not discriminate in who we choose to be part of our team.

We have become one of the most widely used and trusted sites for law students, serving both institutional clients, such as Yale University, American University and University of Illinois, as well as thousands of individual law students.</p><p><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></p><p>We prefer a small and highly effective engineering team, so every new team member is vital to the success of the company.</p><p>You must be a senior, seasoned developer. Technically, we’re mostly interested in your recent Ruby on Rails and general web development experience at all levels of the stack, from front end JS apps, to dealing with search engines, site reliability and performance, and everything in between. You’ll join a small tech team, so your voice will be heard when we need to make new technical decisions as our product grows. We expect you to go beyond coding to give input on the product roadmap, design, and architecture.</p><p>Generally speaking, you should be:</p><ul><li> <strong>A versatile engineer</strong>. You know what you don’t know and feel comfortable learning new skills. You’re not ashamed of recognizing mistakes and take measures to avoid falling again.</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>A team player</strong>. You share code-ownership as much as possible. You don't mind fixing other people’s code or stepping in to help a teammate.</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>A full-stack developer</strong>. You have lots of experience building Rails applications, and you’re also comfortable writing front-end code (HTML/CSS/JS).</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>A minimalist</strong>. You believe a new feature should be built only when the evidence supports it. You’re willing to push back when you believe this rule is being ignored or violated.</li></ul><ul><li> <strong>A great communicator</strong>. You communicate your ideas, feedback, and criticism thoroughly, clearly, and courteously. You believe there’s no such thing as over-explaining or over-clarifying because that’s how miscommunication is avoided.</li></ul><p><strong>Examples of tasks you’ll be assigned to (solo or in a team)</strong></p><ul> <li>Investigate issues reported by our customer support team, determine impact and root cause, and solve them.</li> <li>Discuss new features with our content team and help define the best solutions possible with a focus on the business needs and expected timelines.</li> <li>Participate in the scheduled planning meetings to discuss and estimate work for the iteration.</li> <li>Keep an eye on our infrastructure monitoring and investigate potential issues (we all do ops).</li> </ul><br><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul> <li>Join a small team who loves what they do.</li> <li>Work from home.</li> <li>A competitive salary.</li> <li>Healthcare coverage (including dental) for you and your family.</li> <li>Untracked paid time off and sick leave.</li> <li>401(k) with 3% company matching.</li> </ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Quimbee            </h2>            <div><p>Founded in 2007, Quimbee.com is one of the most widely used andrespected study aids for law students.

We're starting out by helping our customers automate the boring parts of producing client reports. We're looking for a senior software developer with a strong sense of ownership to join our team.</p><p>You will work closely with designers, other developers, and our customer support and sales teams to build new product features from the ground up.</p><p>We're using Ruby/Rails for our front end, with back-end services running in the Play framework (both Scala and Java), with AWS RDS Postgres for the database layer.</p><p>You might be a fit for this position if:</p><ul><li>You've shipped production software to real customers as a mid-level/senior software developer.</li><li>You are experienced with Java (the language and the ecosytem) and have experimented with alternative JVM languages (Scala preferred, but the main point is the desire/ability to learn new things)</li><li>You're familar with and facinated by (but not necessarily an expert in) procedural content generation.</li><li>You're an excellent written and verbal communicator (our team is distributed and communication is vital)</li><li>You prefer to know how the libaries you're using actually work rather than just taking them as given (We'll ask for examples)</li><li>You are not a &quot;single approach&quot; purist in language choice, frameworks, libraries or development paradigms, and have experience with multiple approaches (production use of functional languages is a bonus)</li><li>You have a favorite layer of the stack, but are comfortable/competent all the way from optimizing SQL queries to helping solve problems calling REST services from Javascript.</li><li>You have the judgement (from experience) to evaluate and choose 3rd party libraries (or recommend roll-your-own).</li><li>You've written ETL code, and are familiar with the challenges that happen &quot;in real life&quot; when trying to pull data from a 3rd party service with a quirky API.</li></ul><p>Bonus:</p><ul><li>You're taken a traditional AI course and are familiar with the fundamentals.</li><li>You've worked with (or written) constraint-satisfaction or planning algorithms.</li><li>You've worked with (or written) procedural content generation systems.</li><li>You know who Douglas Engelbart is and why he's important (or just look it up now)</li></ul><p>Writing code to produce content (or help edit it) is a tricky problem, Our system needs to be flexible enough to express the data-stories the users want to tell, but without requiring users to be low-level data manipulation experts. We're solving the problem by baking knowledge into the system, from the the type and meaning of individual metrics (&quot;reach isn't additive&quot;) all the way up to rules about what makes a section of a report well-structured. We use a variety of techniques to encode this knowledge, and since there's no expectation that anyone could have experience with everything, we need developers who love to learn new things and immediately put them into practice. That sounds fun, but it is also quite challenging, and we'd like to hear how you've done similar things in the past.</p><p>If any of this sounds interesting, we highly recommend taking a look at <a href='http://panamplify.com/careers.html' rel='nofollow'>http://panamplify.com/careers.html</a> , Check out what we do and see if you might be interested. If you are, let us know why. If you're not sure, then drop us a note or arrange to stop by the office and we can talk. But please don't just spam us with a resume and generic cover letter, applications like that get routed to /dev/null.</p><p>You must live in and be authorized to work in the United States, and you'll need to make occasional trips to Dallas for all-hands meetings.

No, backbone.js is not this week's hottest JS framework, but that's because these apps have been used and enhanced over the last 3 years in production. They've stood the test of time. But we are using the latest tooling alongside - ES6, webpack, less, nightwatch.js etc to make development as clean as possible.</p><p>Are you passionate about efficient client-side performance and robust, scalable platforms? Do you understand the underlying principles of JS (and haven't just built a simple Angular app)? We're adding to our team to build out our Javascript clients for our API-driven microservice retail platform of 18 loosely coupled services. It’s in production, supporting multiple brands and driving millions of dollars of revenue every month from US sales.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with a globally distributed team of 65. We’re proud of the way we get great work done. Our clients love working with us and partner with us on long-term projects.</p><p><strong>What do we offer?</strong></p><ul><li>Work as part of a talented, globally distributed, successful&nbsp;team</li><li>A focussed adherence to our agile/scrum processes (we really believe it helps getting good work done)</li><li>Hard problems to solve (you won't find all the answers on Stack Overflow) - and the opportunity to own the solutions</li><li>A great working atmosphere where you can share and learn with other smart people</li><li>The best-in-class toolsets: Slack, CI/CD with Docker etc</li><li>Meetups in our Barcelona offices for our remote folks</li><li>Competitive rates</li><li>A long term working relationship</li></ul><p><strong>You'll be:</strong></p><ul><li>Building complex Javascript (mainly ES6, webpack) presentation layers to consume RESTful APIs in a performant way.</li><li>Extracting re-usable components to share across multiple SPAs</li><li>Working on ecommerce and back-office direct sales functionality to support hundreds of thousands of customers.</li><li>Helping the backend engineers in designing, specifying and implementing services to decouple functionality</li><li>Occasionally going full stack and diving in the Rails services to add a new endpoint or modify behavior (and we can help you learn here too)</li><li>Working within&nbsp;a fast moving team (working 11am - 8pm Central European time)</li><li>Identifying bottlenecks, using tools to diagnose and refactor code for scale</li><li>Ensuring the robustness, performance and failure characteristics of the system.</li><li>Writing well tested, defect free code with CI/CD</li><li>Taking ownership of production applications - managing issues, releases and ensuring quality</li></ul><p>Good English verbal and written communication skills are essential. As is production experience of React/Vue/Angular/Backbone framework applications.</p><p>This is a contract position with a long term outlook (12 months+&nbsp;full-time project) for the right candidate. We are looking for remote workers&nbsp;(most of the company is remote) or have openings based in our Barcelona office.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About whitespectre            </h2>            <div><p><strong>Why is it good to work with us?</strong></p><p>We know that big ideas and big results only happen when you have the right people, working together smartly - whether that’s across the room or across the globe. &nbsp;We make the work fun and rewarding.</p><p>Because we work on cool projects. Sure, we can list the latest set of technologies that we use, but that is a given. What's more interesting is how they are used - the design, the architecture, the approach to solving business problems. And we do that across multiple clients - each and every one we're excited to work with.</p><p>Because we believe in constant learning and exploring - whether that’s a new skill, a new role, or a new way of seeing.&nbsp; And because we've found that we learn the most when we take on new challenges as a team.&nbsp; We’re proud that people love working with us (and still have lives outside of work).

FinTechs, Multi-sided Platforms, IoT, Microservice-Landschaften, Start-up-Prototypen</li></ol><p><strong><strong>Gib's zu: Bullet Points scannen reicht nicht... &nbsp;<br></strong>=======================================</strong><br>Komm, nimm dir die Zeit für die ganze Story. ☕️ Wir schwafeln auch nicht, versprochen!&nbsp;</p><p><strong><strong>Warum du bei uns arbeiten solltest</strong></strong></p><p>Zweitag ist aus einem Kreis von Studienfreunden erwachsen und auch wenn wir nun nicht mehr ausschließlich bekannte Gesichter einstellen, steht für uns der <strong>freundschaftlich-unkomplizierte</strong>, aber auch ehrliche Umgang miteinander im Vordergrund. Wir pushen uns gegenseitig, ohne die Ellenbogen auszufahren und wissen, dass teilen und helfen einen weiter bringt als Eigenbrötlerei.</p><p>Wir haben Spaß am gemeinsamen Ausdenken, Ausprobieren, Umsetzen, Optimieren oder Verwerfen und daraus Lernen. Jeder kann Initiative ergreifen, um sich, seine Teammitglieder und Zweitag voranzubringen. Bei uns gewinnen die besten Ideen und eher die <strong>leisen Macher</strong> als die lauten Egos. </p><p>Außerdem nehmen wir Work-Life-Balance ernst. Viele von uns haben gerade eine Familie gegründet  &nbsp;oder zeitintensive Hobbies.  &nbsp;Wir glauben, dass <strong>nachhaltige Ausgeglichenheit</strong> uns viel weiter bringt als Mitarbeitern mehr Zeit abzuverlangen.</p><p><strong><strong>Wie du bei uns arbeitest</strong></strong></p><p>Wir arbeiten selbstorganisiert und eigenverantwortlich in cross-funktionalen Teams. Ein typisches Projekt besteht aus 2-3 Backendlern, 1 Frontendler und 1 Produktarchitekten plus Spezialisten aus Design und Infrastruktur. Unsere Teams entwickeln agil in Sprints, wobei wir großen Wert auf Lernen durch <strong>Reflexion</strong> und Retrospektive legen. In der Konzeption kommt das Know-how aller Beteiligten <strong>gleichberechtigt</strong> zusammen und in der kollaborativen Umsetzung steht jeder für das ganze Team ein.</p><p>Zweitag hält dir den Rücken frei, sodass du <strong>Ruhe zum Arbeiten</strong> hast, nicht überladen wirst und Gelegenheiten zur Weiterbildung bekommst. In Münster bieten wir komfortable, schallgedämpfte Team-Büros und veranstalten z.B. gemeinsame Brownbag-Sessions. Wir haben aber auch Mitarbeiter aus dem Ruhrgebiet, Bielefeld etc., die nicht täglich pendeln. Ein Projektteam hat entschieden, nur alle 2-3 Wochen zur Sprintplanung und Retrospektive reinzukommen, was wunderbar funktioniert. Fully <strong>Remote</strong> wäre für uns neu, aber wir haben uns mental und in Sachen Onboarding &amp; Tooling darauf vorbereitet.</p><p>Pragmatismus und Professionalität gehören für uns zusammen. Es ist die eine Sache, Dinge <em>richtig zu machen</em>. Wir schreiben unseren Code so <strong>sauber, gut lesbar und getestet</strong>, dass wir technische Schulden nur selten eingehen. In den letzten Jahren haben wir aber erkannt, dass der Hebel noch viel größer ist, wenn man nur die <em>richtigen Dinge</em> tut. Das heißt vor allem Projekte wie auch Features nicht brav nickend umsetzen, sondern Annahmen <strong>hinterfragen</strong> und kleinschrittig <strong>herantasten</strong>, getrieben von Feedback und Daten. </p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Zweitag GmbH            </h2>            <div><p><strong><strong>Warum</strong><strong> gibt es uns?</strong></strong></p><p>In der Business-Welt&nbsp;gibt's genau wie bei der Webentwicklung immer ein&nbsp;Trending Topic und aktuell lautet&nbsp;es&nbsp;Digitalisierung.&nbsp;Im Unterschied zu Webtechnologien trauen sich da – vor allem in Deutschland – aber nur wenige dran.&nbsp;Chatbots, ein automatisiertes Zuhause, selbstfahrende Autos – viele tun das noch als Spielerei ab. Nur die wenigsten etablierten Unternehmen gehen ernsthafte Schritte ins Digitale –&nbsp;obwohl sie beobachten, wie Google, Amazon &amp; Co in alle Lebensbereiche eindringen.</p><p>Wir glauben, dass nahezu jedes Unternehmen vom digitalen Wandel betroffen ist. <strong>Wir helfen</strong> ihnen –&nbsp;egal ob Start-up oder experimentierfreudiger Arm von Konzernen – ihre Mission in der digitalen Welt zu realisieren.</p><p><strong><strong>Wie</strong><strong> denken und handeln wir?</strong></strong></p><p>Am Anfang haben wir gemacht, was die Kunden dachten, was sie brauchen.  &nbsp;Mit der Erfahrung im Aufziehen von Projekten gewannen wir dann das Selbstbewusstsein, Sparringspartner in der Produktentwicklung zu werden. Unsere Kunden sehen eine Chance für ein digitales Produkt und bringen ihr Fach- &amp; Branchen-Know-How mit –&nbsp;wir die Vision für Digitales und die Erfahrung in der Umsetzung. Partnerschaftlichkeit und eine gemeinsame Überzeugung vom Vorhaben machen wir zur Bedingung.</p><p>Wir stülpen unsere Lösungen aber nicht über, sondern sind <strong>hungrig</strong> nach neuen Erkenntnissen. In jedem Projekt sehen wir die Chance, viel zu lernen: über Kunden- und Nutzerverhalten oder Einsatzmöglichkeiten von Technologien und Entwicklungs-Patterns.</p><p><strong><strong>Was</strong><strong> machen wir?</strong></strong></p><p>Wir durchdenken mit unseren Projektpartnern das Geschäftsmodell und <strong>validieren</strong> mit Experimenten (z.B. Prototypen) die darin enthalten Annahmen. Wir konzipieren Lösungen und Feedbackmechanismen. Wenn wir von etwas überzeugt sind, setzen wir es <strong>agil</strong> um. In eigenverantwortlichen Entwicklungsteams designen und entwickeln wir dann die Web-Plattform oder mobile App, <strong>maßgeschneidert</strong> zur Realisierung der Ziele.</p><p>Wir erstellen also nur Individualsoftware, das aber branchenübergreifend in allen Facetten:</p><ul><li>digitale Start-ups –&nbsp;wir haben z.B. das ein oder andere FinTech an den Start gebracht</li><li>Plattformen für innovative mittelständische Kunden –&nbsp;z.B. das <a href='https://www.pfreundt.de/produkte/softwareloesungen/' rel='nofollow'>Pfreundt Web Portal</a> mit Anbindung an Waagen von Kipplastern etc.</li><li>interaktive Apps –&nbsp;wie das <a href='https://www.zweitag.de/de/projekte/us-soccer-digital-coaching-center' rel='nofollow'>Coaching Center für US Soccer</a></li><li>große Projekte für Enterprise-Kunden – wie z.B. die <a href='http://zwtg.de/Fuchs-Computerwoche' rel='nofollow'>Microservice-Landschaft für Fuchs Gewürze</a></li></ul><p>Dabei kommen moderne Programmiersprachen wie Ruby mit Rails oder Elixir mit Phoenix zum Einsatz. In Sachen Frontend-Frameworks haben wir AngularJS hinter uns gelassen und erproben gerade React und Vue.js. Bislang verwenden wir den CSS-Präprozessor Sass, blicken dort aber auch auf PostCSS.</p><p><strong>Was hast du davon, wenn du bei uns anfängst?</strong></p><p>Wir wissen, wie sehr unser Erfolg von dem Engagement der Einzelnen abhängt. Daher bieten wir nicht nur ein branchenübliches Gehalt, sondern <strong>beteiligen</strong> unsere Mitarbeiter, die Zweitag maßgeblich nach vorne bringen, am Erfolg von Zweitag und an Joint Ventures &amp; Ausgründungen.</p><p>Neben privat nutzbarem Laptop und Konferenzbudget arbeiten wir gerade daran, weitere Benefits wie Firmenfahrrad (in Münster radelt man!), betriebliche Altersvorsorge, vermögenswirksame Leistungen etc. an den Start zu bringen.</p><p>Am coolsten finden wir, wenn die Perks selbstorganisiert entstehen: Kürzlich haben unsere Seniors beobachtet, dass viele sich in der Freizeit mit neuen Technologien beschäftigen, aber der Austausch fehlt. Ihre Idee des <strong>gemeinschaftlichen Ausprobierens</strong> haben Sie bei einer Brownbag-Session vorgestellt und seitdem treffen sich selbst gefundene “Hack-Teams” einmal die Woche ab 16 Uhr zum gemeinsamen Erforschen von neuen Dingen, unterstützt mit Arbeitszeit und Experimentierbudget. </p><p><strong><strong>Klingt gut soweit?</strong></strong></p><p>Dann meld dich doch mal per E-Mail, <a href='https://twitter.com/zweitag' rel='nofollow'>Twitter</a> oder <a href='https://www.facebook.com/ZweitagGmbH/' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</a> (für Snapchat sind wir wohl schon zu alt…) und wir schnacken bei einem Kaffee im Büro oder virtuell weiter.</p><p>Oder tu uns den Gefallen und verbreite diesen Post&nbsp;–&nbsp;lieben Dank! </p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Work-Life-Balance stimmt bei uns, auch Teilzeit möglich                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wo und wann du arbeitest, entscheidest du (muss für's Team passen)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Coole Projekte, sowohl im Start-up- als auch im Enterprise-Umfeld                            </div>                            <div>                                 Familienbande – bei unseren Feiern gehören Family&amp;Friends einfach dazu                            </div>                            <div>                                 Gesponserte Konferenzbesuche, interne Workshops, Hack-Teams                            </div>                            <div>                                 Frisches Obst, Kaffee, Tee, Wasser und Smoothies                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wir stellen dir ein eigenes MacBook oder Linux-Gerät zur Verfügung                            </div>                            <div>                                 Unser Office liegt mitten im schönen Münster und ist gut erreichbar                            </div>                    ",

We horen graag van je waarom je van programmeren en/of Android houdt, waarom jij dit doet en hoe je denkt ons te kunnen helpen met onze Android projecten.</p><p>Wij zijn een remote team wat betekent dat je veelal vanuit huis zult werken. Uiteraard bezoek je regelmatig een klant, en 1 keer in de 2 weken hebben we een gezamelijke 'coworking' day.

Beide Lösungen können sowohl im Web als auch als Inhouse-Installation genutzt werden. Durch unsere Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung haben wir aber auch zahlreiche Berührungspunkte mit den aktuell wichtigsten CMS und Webservices (WordPress, Atlassian (JIRA, Confluence, Crowd), Typo3, Joomla asp.net, u.v.m.)</p><p><br>Unser Ziel ist es, weitere spannende Applikationen (für den Desktop sowie auch mobile) mit dem Schwerpunkt auf benutzbare IT-Sicherheit zu entwickeln.

Thanks ...the Carve team.</p><p><strong>What's the job?</strong></p><ul><li>Information security consulting: assessing the security of software and hardware systems.</li><li>Understanding how systems are built and learning how to break them.</li><li>Working with our experienced team on short-to-medium term engagements.</li></ul><p><strong>What would you do?</strong></p><p>Every two to three weeks you'll get a new project to work on. A typical project will involve:</p><ul><li><strong>Recon</strong>: Digging into the functionality, design, and implementation of the software system or device.</li><li><strong>Probing</strong>: Searching for implementation weaknesses which could indicate a security issue. This is a combination of tools that we use, tools that we build, and manual probing. For device projects this can include firmware extraction, analysis, and hardware interfacing.</li><li><strong>Extending</strong>: Now that you've found a weakness... how far can you extend your access into the system?</li><li><strong>Writing</strong>: Now that you've hacked your way in you'll need to write-up your findings and work with the developers to make sure they understand what the problem is and how to fix it.</li></ul><p>If you enjoy puzzles and technical variety you'll find this job very enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Who are we looking for?</strong></p><ul><li><em>You do not need to have information security experience.</em> If you've got the right technical background and problem solving skills we can train you in the dark arts of infosec.</li><li>People who enjoy writing code, solving problems with code, and learning how computers work at a fundamental level.</li><li>This is not a &quot;travel every week&quot; type of consultant. We do sometimes work at a client site but most of the time we do our projects remotely.</li></ul><p>We’re hiring for all experience levels: from zero career experience to information security veterans.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Deep experience in software and computers. You may have earned this experience with a degree, career as a software developer, or perhaps you've invested in a technical hobby that took you deep into the rabbit hole.</li><li>Technical writing skills (English)</li><li>Resident of the USA and able to be employed in the USA.</li></ul><p>We encourage remote candidates to reply *if* they are residents of the USA.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Carve Systems            </h2>            <div><p>We’re a team of security consultants who do more than hack. We combine engineering and consulting expertise to act as trusted advisors to the world’s largest companies.&nbsp;<br><br>Working at Carve lets you learn from some of the best and brightest in security - and they aren’t just on our team. We believe in engaging with the broader security community to stay on top of our game. You’ll have the opportunity to attend conferences, conduct research, and expand your horizons outside of project-based work. We always enjoy the endorphin rush from finally exploiting &quot;that bug&quot;, but we make a long-term effort to master both technical and consulting skills.<br><br>We are not chained to our computers. We like to stand up and get outside. We trail run, play music, ride bikes, and enjoy well-rounded lives.

We’re Action Verb.</p><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower organizations worldwide.</p><p>Our products include&nbsp;<a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and&nbsp;<a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><p>Our company consists of 15 (but growing to 19 by the end of the year) full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p><strong>Our Success Strategy</strong></p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We Practice Holacracy</strong></p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of&nbsp;<a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong>&nbsp;As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE<span>→</span></a></p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that&nbsp;<strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</p><p><strong>Design Skills We’re Looking For</strong></p><p>This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.</p><p><strong>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) design</li><li>Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles</li><li>Solid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).</li><li>Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.</li><li>History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li></ul><p><strong>Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history</strong>&nbsp;of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.</p><p>We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.</p><p><strong>Some of Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><p><strong>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills.</strong>&nbsp;We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.</p><p><strong>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire.</strong>&nbsp;We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</p><p><strong>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work.</strong>&nbsp;Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.&nbsp;<a href='https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb' rel='nofollow'>Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</a></p><p><strong>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</p><p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p><p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs' rel='nofollow'>READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p><p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p><p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p><p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Ready To Apply?</strong></p><p>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you,&nbsp;<strong>please apply</strong>.</p><p>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?</li><li>How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs? Is there anything you would add or change?</li><li>Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?</li><li>Are you familiar with Holacracy? Any questions or concerns?</li><li>What’s lacking in your current work arrangement that we could improve?</li><li>What are your philosophies on design?</li><li>What does designing great software look like?</li></ul><p>We look forward to reading your letter!</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully Remote Company!

Had enough of strict work practices, outmoded coding standards, and draconian time management? Frustrated by your daily commute, or not seeing your awesome ideas adopted? We hate these things, too.</p><p>Axsy is passionate about creating outstanding software which delights its users. We’re revolutionising the apps which are used by both large enterprises and small businesses around the world. We’ve operated as a remote-working team since we founded the company and are looking for talented&nbsp;self-starters to join us. You can work from home or a shared workspace of your choosing.&nbsp;</p><p>Our team is mainly based in the UK and we're&nbsp;ideally looking for applicants who can also work from here.&nbsp;If you need to fit work hours around other commitments,&nbsp;that’s ok, and we trust that you can manage your own&nbsp;time effectively. We&nbsp;communicate using Slack, frequent video calls, and occasional in-person&nbsp;meet-ups (3-4 times per year). We're proud of both the team we’ve created and what we’ve achieved so far. We’re punching above our weight and are expanding our team to achieve even more.</p><p>We’re still a relatively small team. We’re all good at what we do and enjoy working together. You’ll have autonomy and respect from day one. No regulations or hierarchy, just a lot of interesting and challenging work to get done. You’ll work on our React Native mobile apps, so we’re looking for people who have extensive experience of Javascript and React. If you know React but not React Native, we think you’ll pick it up pretty quickly. Knowledge of Redux, Flow, GraphQL, native modules, C++ is a bonus.</p><p>The most important skill to us is being able to pick up new concepts and technologies rapidly. Ideally, you're the sort of person who has been programming from an early age, thrives on new challenges, is passionate about technology, takes pride in finding elegant solutions to difficult problems, and has a record of open source project involvement.&nbsp;We hope to find individuals full of energy and enthusiasm, with an eye for detail &amp; good design. We’re very open to new ideas, and our most recent joiners have already introduced new tools &amp; techniques&nbsp;to the team.</p><p>Axsy is well-funded&nbsp;and has a great opportunity to grow &amp; succeed. We’re giving you the chance to be part of our success and we offer share options in addition to other benefits.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Axsy            </h2>            <div><p>Axsy&nbsp;is organised as a remote-working team.

Thanks to modern technology, our team is able to be productive from all over the UK &amp; abroad, achieving a better work-life balance along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>We work with globally-recognised brands, delivering solutions which complement their services, and are well-positioned for future success. Our team is talented &amp; motivated, but with a relaxed &amp; friendly culture&nbsp;that welcomes new recruits.</p><p>We are an&nbsp;equal opportunity&nbsp;employer and&nbsp;value diversity&nbsp;at our company.

We’re not a social gaming gold rush company and we’re not about sweat equity or burning the midnight oil. We invest in clean code, cloud computing, continuous delivery, and well-crafted APIs because they help us to delight our customers. We try new things, and we know when (not) to use them. We invest in our team through conferences, get-togethers, and group learning.</p><p><strong>Who are we looking for?</strong></p><p>We’re looking for a bundle of qualities that are hard to fake: humility, open-mindedness, technical acumen, good decision-making, experience, depth, curiosity, and kindness. We’re looking to grow a well-rounded and closely-knit team, so there’s not a fixed profile that we’re hiring for. We’re looking for game changers of all backgrounds who can make a unique contribution in a small team environment.</p><p><strong>Your experience should show some or all these:</strong></p><ul><li>Work with Ruby and Rails</li><li>Demonstrable success in API (RESTful) development</li><li>UI/UX design with a modern JavaScript Framework</li><li>Test or behavior-driven development and CI</li><li>Object design, data modeling and software architecture skills</li><li>Understanding of business requirements and acceptance criteria</li><li>Selection of new technologies with creativity and due diligence</li></ul><p><strong>It’s great if your experience also demonstrates:</strong></p><ul><li>Deep SQL or no-SQL skills</li><li>Integrating with external systems</li><li>Developing significant libraries, algorithms or adapters</li><li>Managing complexity in large applications</li><li>Leadership of project, team or process</li></ul><p>We'd love to see your Github account, code samples, or anything that shows your work. If such are unavailable, we can give you a short coding exercise. If you provide an example design document or README (or even an email) demonstrating thought and communication that's helpful too. So drop us a line and tell us about yourself!</p><p>We have curated a brief set of questions to help get to know you. We hope it’s an opportunity to share what you care most about and to share your unique experiences and accomplishments. This is not an assessment, so there are no right or wrong answers. A cover letter that contains brief but thoughtful answers to each question is plenty.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>What experiences have most influenced your approach to software development?</li><li>What are you looking for in a team?</li><li>What do you regard as characteristics of well-crafted code?</li><li>We’re always looking for ways to improve our tools and workflow. Do you have any suggestion of a tool or process enhancement you’ve tried or adopted recently that worked well?</li></ul><p><strong>Candidates must be located in the United States and be able to work legally in the United States.

Social trading takes the activity of &quot;investing&quot; -- which previously happened only&nbsp;in private, like some kind of embarrassing biological process&nbsp;-- and brings it out into the sunshine so that other people can watch and benefit.</p><p>On Collective2's web site, you can find traders and investors that you like and admire, and follow along with them in your own brokerage account. Alternately, if you're a good trader, you can attract followers (and earn extra money doing so).</p><p>So Collective2's business touches a lot of interesting areas: finance, trading, automation, algorithms, big-data, risk analysis.</p><p><strong>Remote Only</strong></p><p>Collective2 is a &quot;distributed&quot; company - no central office, no cubicles, no pointy-headed managers. We are a team of men and women working together, full-time, from homes and coworking facilities all over the world.</p><p>We are a small company. We try to keep things on a human (and humane) scale. No politics, no corporate B.S.</p><p>Because we are small, every software developer has tremendous responsibility. We'll keep you challenged and happy.</p><p>And finally:</p><p>Be honest with yourself. The idea of working remotely sounds appealing, but it drives some percentage of the population bat-shit crazy. If you need proximity to warm human flesh, a foosball table, or a communal water cooler, this position probably isn't&nbsp;for you. But if you want to live anywhere&nbsp;you like in the world, dream of giving up your commute, and like the idea of working from&nbsp;the quiet and peace of your home, it might be perfect.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Competitive salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 Live anywhere, work anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 No commute!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Independent working environment                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flat structure                            </div>                    ",

As Intelligent Editing’s employee number four, you’ll have a wide set of responsibilities and the opportunity to contribute across as much of the business as interests you. That might include developing the next phase of our website; transforming our software (PerfectIt) to a SaaS model; or developing new products that will amaze anyone who thinks proofreading must be done manually.</p><p>You’ll work with a wide array of technologies (some of which you probably won’t be familiar with when joining). So a desire and ability to learn new tools is essential. We’re looking for a self-starter who will work on both new development and help modernise our existing codebase. You’ll be working directly with the founder &amp; CEO, as well as our Chief Engineer, to develop the tools that will allow the company to grow in the long term.</p><p>From the first day, you’ll be given a lot of responsibility, so you must be able to work and get things done independently. Although the core role is development, you shouldn’t be afraid to pitch in where needed (including admin, sales and support). In return, you’ll become well versed in a full set of skills valuable to any (or your own) startup.</p><p><strong>Duties and Responsibilities</strong></p><p>You will:</p><ul><li>Develop apps for online Office and add-ons for Google Docs</li><li>Contribute to the development of the next version of PerfectIt</li><li>Redesign our internal word usage databases</li><li>Improve our website</li><li>Work on e-commerce</li><li>Put in place unit tests and quality control mechanisms to improve our codebase.</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Intelligent Editing            </h2>            <div><p>Intelligent Editing launched in 2009. We’re not going to be the next Uber, and we don’t want to be. We like being small and profitable with a great team. We believe in steady growth, quality service and producing an excellent product.</p><p>We produce software that works with English-language documents. Our flagship software, PerfectIt, is an add-in for MS Word that finds mistakes that spelling and grammar checkers won’t find, such as consistency errors and style issues. The English language is a beast! And working to automate proofreading tasks for English is one of the most challenging and interesting aspects of our work.</p><p>We’re at the forefront of proofreading/editing technologies. We were among the first companies to produce apps for Office and add-ons for Google Docs, and we have plans to do more development in these environments as the next generation of word processors takes off.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p><strong>Flexible Working</strong></p><p>We have a team call every day between 3pm and 5pm (UK time). All other hours are flexible. If you produce great work, we don’t care when you do it.</p><p><strong>Remote Working</strong></p><p>Candidates should be based in the United Kingdom. Intelligent Editing has no offices, so candidates should be equipped to work from home.</p><p><strong>A Life Beyond Programming</strong></p><p>We believe that it’s impossible for developers to work more than forty hours per week and sustain quality. Our founder is a workaholic, but he doesn’t want others doing that! So we work forty hours per week, and we don’t do overtime.</p><p>We’re sympathetic to the demands of parenting and welcome applications from experienced professionals who need the flexibility that life with children demands.</p><p><strong>A Stake in Success</strong></p><p>We offer equity in the business so you will own your success. Equity options will be negotiated at the end of the first year.</p><p>Find out more about us at <a href='http://www.intelligentediting.com' rel='nofollow'>www.intelligentediting.com</a></p><p><strong>Other Details</strong></p><p>LENGTH OF CONTRACT: Permanent (subject to a six-month trial).</p><p>SALARY: £30k - £35k (based on experience).</p><p><strong>BEFORE YOU CONTACT US</strong></p><p>Candidates must have the right to work in the UK, and must be based in the UK.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Work from home                            </div>                            <div>                                 Have an equity stake in a startup's success                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible hours                            </div>                            <div>                                 Small team that listens to you                            </div>                    ",

We’re looking to grow our family by one or two faces.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of <a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong> As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about our Holacracy practice.</a></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that <strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about Open Book Management.</a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four quarterly meetings that are hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, and Detroit.</p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. <strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, <strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong> Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully Remote Company!

This may be a good place to add that you should, when applying, mention in the cover letter your favorite food and, if you’re feeling ambitious, include a picture: this is to weed out applicants who mindlessly apply en masse to listings.</p><p>Given the above mentioned autonomy and freedom, you will be expected to debrief with a daily summary of what was accomplished, problems you ran into, what’s planned for the coming days, and maybe a joke or two. :)</p><p>We are a fun, friendly, and closely knit team, and although geographically distant, we have a strong work ethos and communicate regularly allowing for a very friendly and efficient work environment.

You can see our work at <a href='https://www.omgyes.com' rel='nofollow'>OMGYES.com</a></p><p>We get a huge amount of positive feedback from the press all over the world, and foremost from our users, who tell us how much it has helped their relationships and sex lives. It's been a wonderful, fulfilling journey.</p><p>What we need you to do<br>----------------------------<br>We're always working to keep our busy website (13m req/day) highly available, with minimal latency. We need you to design and implement new features that can scale accordingly. You will be making architectural decisions regarding data storage (database, NoSQL, client-side), content delivery (especially video across a wide range of devices), and gaining user insights through analytics.</p><p>Our users are distributed globally; we need to ensure we can serve a media-rich site in many languages to people all over the world. We need to support purchasing in a range of currencies, using different payment methods, with a careful eye to security.</p><p>Our backend was designed before launch. While it performs quite well, our site has evolved quite a bit since those days. We also have a new season of content that is in production. We've started a new project to build a more appropriate system, starting with season two content, and we want you to work with our front-end team to develop it, using modern best practices.</p><p>Who we're looking for<br>---------------------<br>You are completely at home in a server environment; both in the codebase and in the database. When someone proposes a new site feature, you've already assessed its impact on performance, designed a database schema, and half-architected the solution by the time they finish their pitch. As a full-stack developer, your emphasis is on the backend. You know the ins and outs of OWASP. You believe that design begins with data modeling, and your goal is instant gratification for all consumers of your APIs.</p><p>And, you are a scientist. You measure everything and make that data accessible, so you can make good decisions. You can frame improvements in terms of hypothesis and result, rather than conjecture.</p><p>You have more than 5 years of industry experience.</p><p>Technologies you should know<br>----------------------------<br>(In approximate order of importance, descending, not comprehensive!)</p><p>- MySQL / PostgreSQL<br>- Java (Spring Boot)<br>- Python / Ruby / Node.js (and your favorite web frameworks in each)<br>- Couchbase / Redis<br>- Varnish (and general principles of caching)<br>- AWS S3, EC2, Cloudfront (especially signed URLs)<br>- RESTful API design<br>- Git Flow<br>- Elasticsearch / Kibana / Logstash (self-hosted)<br>- Linux command line<br>- Video content delivery</p><p>Interested?<br>-----------<br>Send us your resume and a few words about why our project in particular interests you.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>(Included in job description)</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About OMGYes            </h2>            <div><p>OMGYes conducts large-scale scientific research into taboo topics like sexual pleasure.

Why? Because you’ll be building software that fixes<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xB_tSFJsjsw' rel='nofollow'> INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING experiences for doctors</a>. &nbsp;And it’s incredibly satisfying to modernize, replace &amp; improve outdated, problematic software. &nbsp;It’s important.

In fact, do so enthusiastically.</p><ul><li>...you’ve got a “roll up your sleeves” mentality -- there’s a lot of nitty gritty work to get done.</li></ul><ul><li>… you have “X years of experience” &nbsp;Pshaw. We aren’t big on formal requirements in the credentials department; rather, we want to see <strong>what you’ve worked on</strong>. &nbsp;Show us a project you’re proud of that you shipped and we’ll start the conversation from there. But let’s not kid ourselves -- you should absolutely come without “training wheels” ;).</li></ul><ul><li>… you have excellent design sensibilities and a firm grasp of HTML5 / CSS / SASS, ui toolkits like bootstrap, and probably design tools like Sketch.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>… you’re pretty opinionated about your design choices and can easily articulate/defend your design decisions/rationale when asked “Why did you <em>&lt;insert observation that challenges your design&gt;</em> ?”</li></ul><ul><li>… you have solid <strong>AngularJS</strong> front-end development chops. &nbsp;But, because you love javascript frameworks in general, you’ve played around with -- and probably are opinionated about -- other frameworks like React, Aurelia, Ember, etc. &nbsp;And speaking of opinions, what are your thoughts on Angular 2/4 &lt;-&gt; AngularJS (1.6)?<br><br></li><li>...you should be able to design, architect &amp; implement front-end solutions that reflect your particular problem-solving approach (...and you’ll probably be solving a problem that was based on a story that you yourself were instrumental in either eliciting or refining).<br><br></li><li>… you’re a natural <a href='https://www.ideou.com/pages/design-thinking' rel='nofollow'>Design Thinker</a>. &nbsp;Therefore, you’re good at leveraging your empathy to investigate both known and ambiguous aspects of a complex, convoluted story (lots of these in healthcare!) in order to discover hidden parameters and open alternative paths which may lead to the “real” story. &nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>… &nbsp;you have an admirable understanding of the principles behind a good RESTful API design. (Bonus points for a passing familiarity <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> or any other fullstack tendencies.)<br><br></li><li>… you’re comfortable/knowledgeable with <strong>git. &nbsp;</strong>CI experience a bonus, but not required.<br><br></li><li>… you’ve worked at startups before or have always been looking for an excuse to.<br><br></li><li>… you work well in a loosely structured PM/Managerial environment (we’re agile with a “little a”)</li></ul><p><strong>Us + You?</strong></p><p>As the newest member our product team, you’ll be an integral part of every aspect of our business strategy, dev roadmap, technology architecture decisions, and, undoubtedly, will wear a lot of hats. &nbsp;</p><p>Ones of these hats -- in addition to your techie/design hats -- will almost certainly be the Customer Hat. At Dorsata, we are fervent (rabidly obsessive, really) believers in frequent, high-touch interactions with our involved, loyal customer base, who drives our roadmap. &nbsp;Believe me when I tell you that you’re going to be on a first name basis with many of our customers -- there’s a whole Slack channel full of’em that just can’t wait to meet you. &nbsp;</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Dorsata            </h2>            <div><p>Dorsata’s clinical workflow intelligence platform is designed to work both top of and inside of the existing electronic health records (<a href='https://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/faqs/what-electronic-health-record-ehr' rel='nofollow'>EHRs</a>) that our customers use. The <a href='https://www.dorsata.com' rel='nofollow'>ACOG Prenatal Record</a> -- our flagship product for the Dorsata platform -- is an AngularJS/Rails SPA designed collaboratively with women’s health providers to <em>support</em> the way that they work &amp; think -- not <em>tell</em> them how to work &amp; think (or add additional clerical burdens to their already-busy day). We want practitioners of women’s health to feel like they are using a piece of software not only designed for them, but by them. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>More About Us : Location, Location, Location...</strong></p><p>Dorsata is located in Washington, DC. OK, well technically across the river in Crystal City, VA. &nbsp;We work out of <a href='https://twitter.com/1776dc' rel='nofollow'>1776's</a> excellent location there, which we can't say enough good things about. 1776 has has incredible people, energy, events, perks &amp; workspace setups (and by the way, since we were one of the first companies there, we have the best seats in the house ;) ). &nbsp;</p><p>1776 affords us an *amazing* view that looks out over the Potomac River at cityscape of Washington DC. &nbsp;When you get bored, you can meditate/cogitate/daydream while watching planes land @ Washington Reagan Airport, which is about 300 yards-ish away.</p><p>Oh...and one of the best parts: there is a brand-spanking-new kitchen that will serve you a catered lunch daily. Check out <a href='https://www.instagram.com/1776culinary/' rel='nofollow'>Chef Aaron’s Instagram</a> for a preview of what you’ll have for lunch every day. &nbsp;The cold-brew coffee keg and the generator-sized latte/cappuccino/espresso machine often comes in handy, as well. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>How We Interview &amp; Hire</strong></p><p>Like many of the other startups you are currently perusing on stackoverflow/angellist/liquidtalent(RIP)/hired/vettery/reddit/linkedIn/etc., our interview process begins with an intro call to help you learn more about the role, for us to hear more about you, and to help the two of us decide if Dorsata is a mutual fit. If we move forward, the next step will be a more in depth on-site meeting with us that dives into some problem solving (how would you do this? / what do you think about XYZ?) and some Show &amp; Tell (a project you've worked on before). Note, we <strong>DO NOT</strong> do coding tests (<em>write us a FizzBuzz, please?</em>) or brain-teasers (<em>Why are manhole covers round?</em>). &nbsp;</p><p>The onsite can always work around your schedule's flexibility, but we like to have you meet several key people on the team, as well as our CEO and founding team to get a flavor for who we are and how we work.</p><p><strong>Benefits / Perks / Comp</strong></p><ul><li>Health Insurance / Dental</li><li>Market salary + equity participation opportunity</li><li>We're pretty flexible with respect to working in the office, at home, or occasional stints in Antarctica.</li><li>Did we say “office”?

It starts with building a profitable, stable company and extending the more traditional benefits to our associates and their families, including:</p><p><br>• Multiple Health Plan options (including PPO/HMO), company-paid premiums for all associates, and with no waiting period<br>• Life Insurance, AD&amp;D, and Short- and Long-Term Disability, with premium covered by DEG<br>• Independent Insurance and Pre-Tax Flexible Spending Accounts<br>• Optional Group Dental and Vision Plans<br>• Optional 401k Retirement Savings Plan with company sponsored matching program<br>• Personal Emergency Services, including travel assistance and identity theft protection<br>• Bonus Plan based on company and individual performance<br>• Paid Time Off (PTO) and Holidays</p><p><br>But just as our take on digital strategy is far from traditional, so are the benefits of hanging your hat here at DEG. Ours is a fun, energetic, casual work environment. We offer flexible schedules and collaborative, cross-disciplinary work. You have the opportunity to work with high-profile clients in myriad industries and visionary leaders and technologists in every discipline. And, of course, there’s free soda, juice, and Starbuck’s coffee in our company coffeehouse.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the day-to-day realities of programming.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75K-95K (Mid-Level) and $95-115K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>I know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>If you are local, we do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developers who want to add to Kibana and X-Pack?

Their progress in the first year is amazing.” - One of our investors</em></p><p>Retailers use archaic, old systems that don’t work (think fax machines and voicemails). We’re replacing the core operational processes with a modern platform that our customers love. Help us transform a $4.4 trillion industry and improve the way millions of people work. Major retailers are already using Zipline every day, but there is so much more to do!</p><p><em>“I think I just shed a tear. This is great!” – One of our Fortune 100 customers</em></p><p>We’re looking for you, our first mobile developer. There is a lot of opportunity to set a solid foundation for our mobile app and we want to bring on the right person to make that happen. You will be working closely with our design team and our engineering team to deliver a set of high quality mobile apps. We’ll help you build a team as necessary to make sure you can deliver on the goals we set together.</p><p>You get to start with a mostly clean slate. Deep understanding of at least one mobile framework is a must, and previous experience with Ruby on Rails would be a nice addition so that we can move quickly. We currently only have a simple iOS app in the app store and are actively deciding on the best way to deliver great mobile apps. You will be central to those conversations and influence the direction that we take.</p><p>We like what Basecamp has been doing to balance hybrid architecture:&nbsp;https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-3-for-ios-hybrid-architecture-afc071589c25</p><p>You will help define our culture through hiring decisions, process design, and your personality. You don’t need to have experience with management. But, a desire to help your co-workers grow makes a world of difference.</p><h4><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h4><ul><li>Support the entire application lifecycle (concept, design, test, release and support)&nbsp;</li><li>Produce fully functional mobile applications writing clean code&nbsp;</li><li>Gather specific requirements and suggest solutions&nbsp;</li><li>Write unit and UI tests to identify malfunctions&nbsp;</li><li>Troubleshoot and debug to optimize performance&nbsp;</li><li>Stay up-to-date with new technology trends</li></ul><h4>Requirements</h4><ul><li>A preference for getting things done&nbsp;</li><li>Proven work experience as a Mobile developer&nbsp;</li><li>Demonstrable portfolio of released applications on the App store or the Android market&nbsp;</li><li>In-depth knowledge of at least one programming language like Swift and Java&nbsp;</li><li>Experience with third-party libraries and APIs&nbsp;</li><li>Familiarity with OOP design principles&nbsp;</li><li>Excellent analytical skills with a good problem-solving attitude&nbsp;</li><li>Ability to perform in a team environment&nbsp;</li><li>Ability to write well tested applications</li></ul><h4>Benefits</h4><p>We’re a fully remote company, building a product that makes money and that people love. For a full time hire, we’re looking anywhere in the US or Canada.</p><p>Our team is small but strong and we ship things that have tangible impact. Being small, you get to impact more than the product.</p><p>We have a flexible vacation policy, full extended benefits, and a flexible work week depending on your needs. We also cover certain education costs and things you need to purchase to be able to work comfortably. In short, we all work together to make your work life great. :)</p></div></div><div></div></div></div></div>",

Their progress in the first year is amazing.” - One of our investors</em></p><p>Retailers use archaic, old systems that don't work (think fax machines and voicemails). We're replacing the core operational processes with a modern platform that our customers love. Help us transform a $4.4 trillion industry and improve the way millions of people work. Major retailers are already using Zipline every day, but there is so much more to do!</p><p><em>“I think I just shed a tear. This is great!” – One of our Fortune 100 customers</em></p><p>We're looking for you, our first mobile developer.

You will be working closely with our design team and our engineering team to deliver a set of high quality mobile apps. We'll help you build a team as necessary to make sure you can deliver on the goals we set together.</p><p>You get to start with a mostly clean slate. Deep understanding of at least one mobile framework is a must, and previous experience with Ruby on Rails would be a nice addition so that we can move quickly. We currently only have a simple iOS app in the app store and are actively deciding on the best way to deliver great mobile apps. You will be central to those conversations and influence the direction that we take.</p><p>We like what Basecamp has been doing to balance hybrid architecture:&nbsp;https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-3-for-ios-hybrid-architecture-afc071589c25</p><p>You will help define our culture through hiring decisions, process design, and your personality.

For a full time hire, we're looking anywhere in the US or Canada.</p><p>Our team is small but strong and we ship things that have tangible impact. Being small, you get to impact more than the product.</p><p>We have a flexible vacation policy, full extended benefits, and a flexible work week depending on your needs. We also cover certain education costs and things you need to purchase to be able to work comfortably. In short, we all work together to make your work life great. :)</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> We have a flexible vacation policy, full extended benefits for Canadian employees, and a flexible work week depending on your needs.

Working for a small company, you know how important growth is, and you work to identify 80% solutions to close loops, and move on to the next challenging problem to solve.</div><div><br></div><div>You've worked heavily with APIs and Webhooks in the past. You understand idempotency, error handling, race conditions, and you've witnessed first-hand what can go wrong when careful planning doesn't go into system architecture.</div><div><br></div><div>You write unit tests with RSpec, and request specs too. But you don't overcomplicate the codebase in the name of faster tests.</div><div><br></div><div>You love writing documentation so that customers, teammates, and future-you don't have to use those darn brains to figure-out already solved problems.</div><div><br></div><div>And you're not afraid to hop on the phone with leads/customers to help ensure they're integration/experience is going smoothly.</div><div><br></div><div><b>We're at our best when we're solving hard problems for customers, and you take pride in being a part of that.</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>--</b></div><div><b>Your responsibilities at Churn Buster:</b></div><ul><li>Add new payment processor integrations</li><li>Improve existing integrations</li><li>Simplify/speed up onboarding for all integrations</li><li>Work with our customers' engineering teams when they need help</li><li>Write documentation regularly for recurring confusion points</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Requirements/Experience:</b></div><ul><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Sidekiq/Background workers</li><li>OOP/POROs</li><li>APIs</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Heroku/Review Apps</li><li>Git</li><li>RSpec</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Bonus Points:</b></div><ul><li>Payment-related APIs: Stripe, Braintree, etc</li><li>Sinatra</li><li>SQL (knowing when to not use ActiveRecord)</li><li>Component based Rails applications/Wisper</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>About the Job:</b></div><ul><li>Full-Time</li><li>100% Remote (US Pacific Time preferred, California even better - time zone is important since we'll be pairing frequently)</li><li>Unlimited Vacation</li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Email <a href='mailto:matt@churnbuster.io' rel='nofollow'>matt@churnbuster.io</a> and share why you think you're the perfect fit for the next chapter at Churn Buster.

We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you.

A few months ago our recruiting process was going well enough that we had a comment in our HN post from a candidate we'd passed on who was happy enough with the experience that they recommended us in the thread [1]. Last month, however we had the exact opposite experience. Two candidates commented about investing significant effort in the process, only to be ghosted [2].</p><p>I arrived at those comments too late to reply, so I'm using this month's post to apologize. I dug into what happened here and found that we did indeed drop the ball with a few candidates and failed to follow up. Certainly it wasn't our intent and doesn't reflect our values. We've audited the entire candidate pool and have reached out to anyone that fell through the cracks to properly close the loop.  I personally apologize for your poor experiences and the criticism is well deserved.</p><p>I also want to thank the people who commented. I think posting that kind of feedback warning others is an excellent way to keep other members of the community informed, and hold each-other accountable. In this case we've overhauled and streamlined our processes so that we're confident this won't happen again in the future.

We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything in this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!</p><p>As a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry. You will help us shape the digital guest experience for restaurant brands served by Olo. You will contribute to technology selection, architecture and user experience for our front-end applications.</p><p>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience building user interfaces that put users first and look and feel awesome to use</li><li>Deep knowledge of ES6/ES2015+ and one or more modern Javascript frameworks, with a preference for React or Ember</li><li>Demonstrable understanding of the full .NET web stack</li><li>Leadership experience that spans one or more aspects of technology selection, architecture and design oversight, and mentoring others</li><li>Superb problem solving skills with an emphasis on pragmatism, quality, and performance</li><li>Passion for learning new skills and technologies</li><li>Excellent collaboration skills</li><li>BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience</li><li>Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S.</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo reaches millions of consumers by powering mobile and online ordering for many of the country’s largest restaurant chains. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.</p><p>We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller.  We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

We're looking for an excellent Ruby developer to build out Baymard's custom-built Rails-based web platform.<br><br><strong>The Job</strong><br>In this position, you will have a lot of influence on the technical direction of the company since all Baymard employees are e-commerce UX researchers except one (Jamie, co-founder of the business, and the person you’ll be working most closely together with). It’s an opportunity to help envision and build the technical platform of a research company that, while it works with tech, isn't yet another app or web service. (Because of this we’re also more than happy to open-source our internal code and scripts because we don't make our money from code.)<br><br><strong>Requirements</strong><br>- We're looking for someone with strong programming skills since we want you to take charge / ownership of our tech platform.<br>- Since all of our current infrastructure is written in Ruby, it's a major plus if that's your choice of language too.<br>- Familiarity with JavaScript and CSS are a bonus, but not required.<br><br><em>Note: you must be fluent in English, comfortable working remotely via digital platforms and willing to do a few yearly travels for team meetups (expect 2-4 weeks of travel each year).</em><br><br><strong>Are We A Good Fit?</strong><br>If you’re looking for a chance to work on long-term goals rather than chasing monthly user growth targets, this will be a good match. We’re a business that has been profitable from day one and we really don’t care about temporarily spiking our user metrics in order to flip the company or impress VC investors. We’re much more interested in steady and sustainable improvements to our business – continually increasing the value we deliver to our customers (from which sustained increases in profitability organically follow). Since all of Baymard’s research is delivered through its website, your work will have an immediate and tangible impact on the company.<br><br>We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which many of our employees do). If you want to, you’re of course also welcome to work in our Copenhagen-based office.<br><br><strong>About Baymard</strong><br>Baymard Institute is a small independent web usability research organization, specialized in conducting large-scale generic usability studies of e-commerce sites. These studies are published as industry reports and benchmark databases at baymard.com (this site is a big part of the web platform you’ll be working on) – which is being used by thousands of web professionals, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.<br><br>You'll be working with a team of dedicated usability researchers conducting cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc.)?<br><br><strong>Apply</strong><br>If you’re interested in this position, please send the following to jamie+job@baymard.com (listed in order of importance):<br><br>- Samples of back-end code you’ve written.<br>- Samples of front-end code you’ve written (optional).<br>- Other information you find relevant (hobbies, interests, work experience, CV, ..).<br><br><em>Note: All applications and materials are kept strictly confidential. That said, open-source contributions are perfectly fine as code samples too – just send along / point us towards whatever “work” you feel best represents your skills.</em></p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

Users of our service can also consolidate the pensions that we trace, to make their pension pot easier to manage and give them a better return when they retire.<br /><br />We are looking for an experienced front-end web developer, to help us develop new customer-led features, and to improve our current service both functionally and visually.<br /><br />We need someone who is smart, organised, motivated and gets things done. Someone who wants to work in a startup environment and likes the idea of doing a bit of everything and taking ownership of what they work on. Someone with ideas about everything, isn’t afraid to argue their point (while respecting everyone else’s of course) and is constantly thinking “How can we do this better?”.<br /><br />Who you are:<br /><br />* You have at least 2 years of commercial experience working as a front-end developer.<br />* You have excellent HTML, CSS (and &quot;plain-old&quot; Javascript) coding skills, with the ability to produce responsive, cross-browser, interactive web pages.<br />* Your interest in development extends past coding; you have a passion for products and a perspective on user experience and product design.<br />* An independent streak is essential – although you will work closely with other members of our team, you will be required at times to drive work forward without being spoon-fed.<br />* Ideally you have already worked within a development team using web frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails or Elixir-Phoenix, as you will be assisting our back-end development team with the integration of your front-end code with the rest of the application.<br />* **Note:** We are _not currently_ looking for a pure &quot;Javascript Framework&quot; developer (e.g. Angular.js, ReactJS experience is not required), we are looking for a HTML and CSS specialist who can work turn designs and prototypes into working web-pages.  However, any exposure to these technologies would be useful to help with scoping future application requirements.<br /><br />What you’ll do:<br /><br />* Collaborate closely with our UX designers, strategists, CTO and back-end developers, to turn ideas into working features.<br />* Develop our products and services across web, mobile, and other touch devices (HTML web application, native mobile not required)<br />* Work using “Source Control” (i.e. Github) and “Pull Requests” to ensure a high level of quality in your code and an excellent end product for our customers.<br />* Use Agile techniques to iteratively ship products in a small, self-organised team.<br /><br />How to apply:<br /><br />* This position will be based in our Dublin office, but regular visits to our London and Bristol offices will are required. Some remote working may be possible, but we are not looking for fully-remote developers.<br />* If you have done any open-source work, links (e.g. Github projects) would be welcome. However, we recognise that not all companies allow such work, and absence of this will not be counted against your application.<br />* This is a permanent, salaried position. Salary will based on experience.<br />* No recruitment companies please.",

In the meeting rooms you might find grass instead of carpet, in the summer you’ll meet all our families together for a celebration and in the winter you can find Mexican wrestlers or circus acts roaming around. Weekly social and sports events give you the opportunity to stretch both your mind and body, whether it be getting involved in a meetup or brownbag session, playing in the poker tournament or joining one of the many sports teams. But our culture is not just in what you can see it's in everything we do, we're hard workers and we get stuck in. We have fun, making fun and our vision is to invent, play and discover together, to craft experiences that thrill our players and rock the world.</span>",

Or a front-end developer who knows Ruby?</p><p>Would you like to envision and develop the web platform for a team of dedicated usability researchers conducting cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc.)?</p><p>Then apply for the following full-time job at Baymard Institute – either working remotely or in Copenhagen, Denmark (or a mix!).</p><h3>About the Job</h3><p>Baymard Institute is a small independent web usability research organization, specialized in conducting large-scale generic usability studies of e-commerce sites. These studies are published as industry reports and benchmark databases at baymard.com (this site is a big part of the web platform you’ll be working on) – which is being used by thousands of web professionals, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.</p><p>In this position you will have a lot of influence on the technical direction of the company since all Baymard employees are e-commerce UX researchers except one (Jamie, co-founder of the business, and the person you’ll be working most closely together with). It’s an opportunity to help envision and build the technical platform of a company that works with tech but doesn’t sell it. (Because of this we’re also more than happy to open-source our internal code and scripts.)</p><p>If you’re looking for a chance to work on long-term goals rather than chasing monthly user growth targets, this will be a good match. We’re a business that has been profitable from day one and we really don’t care about temporarily spiking our user metrics in order to flip the company or impress VC investors. We’re much more interested in steady and sustainable improvements to our business – continually increasing the value we deliver to our customers (from which sustained increases in profitability organically follow). Since all of Baymard’s research is delivered through its website, your work will have an immediate and tangible impact on the company.</p><p>We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which many of our employees do). If you want to, you’re of course also welcome to work in our Copenhagen-based office.</p><p>Salary: in accordance with qualifications.</p><p>Start date: preferably before the end of 2017.</p><h3>Job Requirements</h3><p>You’re skills and interests must span from design to back-end coding. Strong skills in one area can compensate for a weaker side in other areas, but you’ll regularly be working across the spectrum of back-end programming, front-end code, and user interface design, and therefore must have basic skills in all these areas – and even more importantly: enjoy working in all of them!</p><p>Specifically, we’re looking for:</p><ul><li><strong>Back-end skills</strong> – basic programming chops is a requirement for this position, and solid back-end skills is considered a major plus. Familiarity with Ruby is a bonus, but by no means a necessity.</li><li><strong>Front-end skills</strong> – you should be confident in JavaScript and <span>CSS</span>, be able to appreciate concepts such as progressive enhancement, and care deeply about how all of these things tie together and how they impact the end-user experience.</li><li><strong>Design skills</strong> – while we’re definitely not looking for a graphic designer, you must be curious about design and how it shapes users’ perceptions, and enjoy thinking through and tweaking the user interfaces you’re building.</li><li><strong>Interest in UX and e-commerce</strong> is a bonus, but no experience or skills are necessary in this area as you’ll work with (and have the option to be trained by) the best in the business.</li><p></p></ul><p>We furthermore expect you to be fluent in english, comfortable working remotely via digital platforms and willing to do a few yearly travels for team meetups (expect 2-5 weeks of travel each year).</p><h3>Application</h3><p>If you’re interested in this position please send the following (listed in order of importance):</p><ol><li>Samples of back-end code you’ve written.</li><li>Samples of front-end code you’ve written.</li><li>Samples of user interfaces you’ve designed, been involved in designing, or helped implement (please indicate your level of involvement).</li><li>Other information you find relevant (hobbies, interests, work experience, CV, ..).</li></ol><p>Note: open-source contributions are perfectly fine as code samples – simply send along / point us towards whatever “work” you feel best represents your skills.</p><p>Deadline is October 13, 2017. However, we’ll review applications on an ongoing basis, so earlier applicants do have a better chance. All applications and materials are kept strictly confidential.</p><h3>How to apply</h3>",

All companies should be able to understand how to engage the public - big or small - and with focaldata’s platform, they can.<br /> <br />Most recently, our analytics solution for a major client was cited in Reuters, Guardian and the Telegraph, and we won CogX AI Political Product of the Year 2017 out of 350 competing startups.

    "content": "*About Koru Kids*<br /><br />Koru Kids is on a mission to improve childcare in London. We’re making it easier and more affordable for families to access flexible and high quality childcare, by helping them share nannies with other families. This helps bring down the cost of childcare for the parents, means the nanny gets paid more, and gives the children a new friend to play with. Parents have responded enthusiastically, and our network of families is growing very fast.    <br /><br />We are backed by fantastic investors, including top venture capitalists and business angels such as Michael Pennington the founder of Gumtree. We won the South of England region in the ‘Best of Britain’ awards 2017, and are currently shortlisted for several awards: the UK Business Awards 2017 as ‘Disruptor of the Year’, and in the Best Women Awards 2017 as ‘Best New Business’, ‘Best Technology’ and ‘Best company working with children and families’.<br /> <br />*About the Team*<br /><br />We have an informal, hard-working and kind team culture.  <br />* Our founder is Rachel Carrell, the former CEO of DrThom.com, the world’s largest online doctor service, which she grew to over 1.3m paying users in 3 countries.  She’s an Oxford alumn, ex-McKinsey, a Rhodes Scholar and a WEF Young Global Leader. <br />* Rachel’s joined by an amazing team with backgrounds including Cambridge, UCL, BCG, KPMG,  and some of London’s top startups. We take great care with who we hire and all team members are superbly talented. If you’re brilliant AND humble, you’ll fit right in. <br /><br />We work from a beautiful co-working space near Old St in central London. The office has free snacks and drinks, a gym and showers, bike storage and a programme of social events. <br /><br />*About the role*<br /><br />We are growing really fast, and we need someone to come and join our ‘matching’ team. This is the heart of the business, where the magic happens!  <br />* You’ll be responsible for creating happy outcomes every day for parents and nannies, by matching them up so that the nannies can look after the kids. Most of your day will be spent communicating with parents and nannies, over the phone and email, in order to do this matching<br />* You’ll also have lots of freedom to reflect, analyse, experiment, innovate and improve the way we do things. You’ll be encouraged to think about human psychology, ‘nudges’, messaging and marketing, tracking and analysing data, algorithms and automation – all as part of the job as we improve the way matching works. We’ll welcome your ideas<br />* You’ll get exposure to all other parts of the business including marketing, finance, software, and operations. At times you might help out with tasks related to these things as well <br />* You’ll be a core member of our team, and you’ll get all the training, coaching and support you need to do your job well. We’ll invest in your development and help you succeed  <br /><br />Your normal hours of work will be 830am to 6pm, although there may be times when late nights are required to cope with particular ‘spikes’ in demand. We know you have a private life and other commitments and we work as a team to make sure everyone has a good balance. You’ll normally work from our offices near Old St, although if you like to occasionally work from home that’s totally fine too.   <br /><br />3 reasons this role is great: <br />* You will learn a TON.  Customer-facing operations will be your main focus, but you’ll get plenty of exposure to marketing and other aspects of the business. You’ll learn how to found a business, about operations, marketing, technology, and finance.  You’ll also be surrounded by other startups trying to grow. If you want to, you can get stuck into the London startup scene, with its evening meetups and events, which is incredibly dynamic and fun.  <br />* You’ll be making a huge difference to the everyday lives of parents in London. We’re building a business that will profoundly benefit children, women, and families.  <br />* We’re well-connected in the startup world, so working with us will open lots of doors for you even if you leave. We’ve got a strong track record of helping people we’ve worked with<br /><br />*About you*<br />We’re after an all-rounder who is clever, practical, positive and nice. We don’t mind what degree you’ve done, as long as you’ve done well in it. We’ll also be looking for evidence of drive, aspiration, spark and energy in the extracurricular stuff you’ve done. <br /><br />Essential skills<br />* You’re able to write clearly, simply and accurately, with perfect spelling and grammar<br />* You’re comfortable speaking to new people, both in person and on the phone <br />* You like working with numbers and data. We love people who love analysis<br />* You can work at a fast pace and under pressure<br />* You’re emotionally intelligent. Although you’ll like to talk, the most important thing you’ll do is listen. Choosing childcare is an emotional decision, and you’ll need to help parents through the process<br />* You’re detail-oriented. We deal with payroll and payments, and the details must be 100% correct<br />* You’re a problem-solver. As we are a young company, there aren’t many fixed processes yet. That means you can create new processes, make suggestions, and tell us we’re doing things wrong <br />* You roll with it. You understand that startups are unpredictable environments. You are comfortable with a degree of chaos<br />* You’re nice. You get that no player is bigger than the team. You fit right into our culture of supporting and helping each other.",
