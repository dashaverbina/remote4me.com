When we boot-strapped Edgar in mid-2014 it quickly became profitable and now has 1000s of happy, beautiful, paying customers. We want your help to do it all over again.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s a greenfield project (yay!), so you’ll be instrumental in making the technical decisions of how it all comes together, working in a pure React/Redux environment.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll be joining a small team of talented developers, and working alongside dedicated UX designers, QA and Customer Experience pros.</div><div><br></div><div>Our stack is a React/Redux front end, consuming an Elixir/Phoenix back end hosted on Google Cloud. It’s great stack to work with everyday, and we take our time to write solid code and proper tests to make sure it stays that way.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Dev Process</b></div><div>We do a fair amount of pair programming and a lot of code reviews, we love solid tests and continuous integration, and we deploy several times a week. Basically? We’re constantly improving our process so we can create an ideal developer environment - low overheads, high transparency. Estimates were inaccurate and irrelevant, so we dropped ‘em. Artificial deadlines weren’t doing it for us, so we switched from scrum to pure kanban and never looked back. When something isn’t working, we’re not afraid to throw it out and try something new - so if you have exciting ideas about the dev process and how to make your own job even better, you’ll fit right in. (We’re open-minded like that.)</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll have final responsibility for the solutions you build, from inception all the way through to deployment, so your teammates know exactly who to shower with praise when you ship to production.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About Us</b></div><div>We’re a small team of about 30 people, all working remotely across the US &amp; Canada. We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual meetup week where we work together on cool projects all day and generally make fools of ourselves all night. We’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks.</div><div><br></div><div>We'll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people yourself. We like those people.)</div><div><br></div><div>We know we’re ridiculously lucky to have this crack squad of ambitious, kind, independent little nerds, and we want to keep that going by bringing in even more people who love geeking out about what they do and doing work they’ll be super proud of.

We’re a small, smart team focused on delighting our customers and responsibly building a lasting company -- and our track record of growth proves it. We're the market leader in our space, we operate in six major metro areas, and we're growing fast. We value communication, transparency, give-a-damn-ness, and a strong bias toward freedom &amp; responsibility over big company hierarchies and processes.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>ROLE</b></div><div><br></div><div><span>As a product development team, we hold one another to a high bar. Expect to be challenged, learn, teach, and -- like all of us here -- grow in how you work, the tools/processes you use, your technical acumen as an engineer and as a mentor, and the quality and speed of your output. Growth is a part of our DNA, and you'll bring something to the table, too. Working with us means you’ll gain the confidence, knowledge, and experience you need to build and run your own product company.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>What you'll do:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Own what you build - working across the entire stack (python on the back end; javascript on the front end)<br></li><li>Delight internal and external customers with amazing UX<br></li><li>Build microservices from scratch and improve existing microservices<br></li><li>Collaborate with and mentor other engineers on architecture, code, and process<br></li><li>Incubate and contribute to our open-source projects that magnify our team's effectiveness</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Some technical challenges we're cracking away at:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>An ML pipeline to match customers with the best recommendations<br></li><li>A predictive model for customer retention and happiness<br></li><li>State of the art web and mobile apps to give our users more power and flexibility<br></li><li>A loosely coupled microservices architecture</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>&nbsp;You</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>A pragmatic, customer-first mindset<br></li><li>A curious, determined, self-motivated personality (we'd love to see your side projects)<br></li><li>We love founders and engineers who have joined early stage companies<br></li><li>Fluent across the entire stack, from the database all the way up to the browser<br></li><li>5+ years experience as an engineer with a generalist/full-stack bent<br></li><li>Advanced knowledge in either python, ruby, or javascript</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>WHY JOIN US?</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>When you walk in the door, one of the first things you’ll notice is the vibe of casual collaboration as teams solve problems and work over ideas at whiteboards, couches, and kitchen tables -- and probably see a puppy wandering around, too. Come at lunch and see people chatting around the tables with an amazing spread from one of our local catering partners downstairs and a yoga class going on upstairs. A few things you won’t find at ZeroCater: office politics, apathetic people, unethical leadership, sad gray cubicles, and isolated teams that don’t talk to one another.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We recognize that diversity + openness makes us better as a community so you'll also see that, unlike most tech companies, we actually walk the walk: we’re 62% female and 43% non-Caucasian. Applicants are considered without regards to race, color, religion, national origin, age,s ex, marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or other protected statuses.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q&amp;A</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. What is your technical architecture like?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. We largely work with a bleeding-edge microservices architecture. Services are decoupled and talk to one another by broadcasting events over a shared message bus. Most of our back-end services are either python/django or node.js with postgres databases, hosted on Heroku.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. What development environment do you use?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. All our developers currently use MacOS, but you’re free to use whatever platform you wish. Our development environment runs in a docker container and is built with a single command line.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. What is your development workflow like?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. Our typical development workflow includes committing unit-tested code to branches, creating pull requests for code reviews, automated linting &amp; CI. `master` branches are always deployable. Because we’re building a robust engineering culture, these processes aren’t dictated by management -- instead, the team debates alternatives and decides on the workflows that support its objectives.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. What’s your engineering culture like?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. We’re a tight-knit bunch. It’s not to say we don’t have our disagreements -- like every team, we have those too. But we live a culture of service: if you need a hand, someone always has your back. Why does a culture of service make us stronger? Because it creates stability and helps us learn from one another. Also, we often get together for dinner (outside of work), board games at lunch, hikes, and we also host poker nights for the entire company.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. Why should I work at ZeroCater over Company X?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. Small team at a cultural inflection point. Thoughtful people who give a damn. Leadership with proven track records. Chunky problems you can really sink your teeth into. The chance to mentor and be mentored. A company with a proven business model. The chance to embiggen the pie for everyone.</span><br></div><div></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Apply online at <a href=&quot;https://boards.greenhouse.io/zerocater/jobs/501865&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://boards.greenhouse.io/zerocater/jobs/501865</a></p>  </div>",

Edgar launched in mid-2014 and has thousands of happy, beautiful, paying customers that will use the features you build every day.</div><div>You’ll be working on big, exciting projects like optimizing our Sidekiq queuing system, building out ReactJS components, adding support for social media platform-specific features like native video, and getting our onboarding juuuust right so that every user has a mind-blowing experience from their very first login.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll be joining a small team of senior level full-stack developers, and working alongside dedicated QA and Customer Experience pros.</div><div><br></div><div>Our stack is Rails 4, Ruby 2.2, Heroku, Postgres, S3, Sidekiq Pro, a little Redis, with ReactJS &amp; Redux on the front-end.

Basically? We’re constantly improving our process so we can create an ideal developer environment - low overheads, high transparency. Estimates were inaccurate and irrelevant, so we dropped ‘em. Artificial deadlines weren’t doing it for us, so we switched from scrum to pure kanban and never looked back. When something isn’t working, we’re not afraid to throw it out and try something new - so if you have exciting ideas about the dev process and how to make your own job even better, you’ll fit right in.

We do a lot of collaborating and meme-swapping on Slack, along with virtual team meetings and super-futuristic video calls. We also do a twice-annual meetup week where we work together on cool projects all day and generally make fools of ourselves all night. We’re proudly bootstrapped and profitable, which means we get to turn down VC money a lot and keep doing things the way we like. We’re pretty serious about building and maintaining an awesome, positive company culture, so, you know, no jerks.</div><div><br></div><div>We'll probably get along if you’re someone who wants to be creative, have a pretty-serious-but-not-inhuman amount of responsibility, and work with people who make going to work not suck. (And be one of those people yourself.

For eight straight years after opening our law firm we grew gross revenues 40% a year until well, we didn't. During this same eight-year period, we grew our payroll at about 40% to handle the increased volume. I told myself during this youthful time I was being a shrewd business owner and the reason I wasn't personally more financially successful was because I<br><br>was reinvesting the revenues into the business. The truth was I mistakenly thought growth would fix all our problems. In 2012 I woke up after seeing revenues significantly decline, not having enough money to routinely pay myself, and quickly realized our lack of systems was the real chokehold on our success.<br><br>With seven offices handling multiple practice areas I worked at a level of complexity that was exhausting. It isn't accurate to say our firm was without systems, but in 2012 we felt like a body builder who is all upper body with tiny legs. Our muscle was a well-developed marketing strategy, and our legs were the systems that supported the firm.<br><br>It took us two years to shore up our infrastructure with deep practice, expert advice, and solutions we borrowed from other industries. We attended multiple guru events, hired numerous consultants, and our audible business library grew quite large. What we learned was to fall in love with the process of systematizing. Why else write this? We love it. 80/20 is what it's all about. Getting a disproportionate return on your investment should be the reward of every improvement.<br><br>We continue to get guidance from several experts and do not claim to have all the answers. We share numbers with other law firms across the country and are committed to progress, not perfection. Asked if I want to grow like we did before, I would say no. Marketing and infrastructure go hand in hand. At whatever speed you can grow both together, make it happen. Disciplined Practices is about doing the right stuff consistently that continually builds momentum.</p>            </div>                        </div>",

LimeLM is a licensing solution for Windows, macOS, and Linux. And wyBuild is an updating and installer solution exclusively for Windows. The languages these products are written in is varied (C/C++ are the biggest languages, C# probably the next biggest, PHP, and then a smattering of other languages depending on the tool, library, or need we have). Check out our website with an overview of the 2 products: <a href=&quot;https://wyday.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://wyday.com/</a></p><p><strong>What we're looking for: </strong> A flexible, focused, creative and smart programmer with a strong sense of motivation. Specifically:</p><ol><li><p>You want to be a full-time employee and you’re comfortable with and efficient at working from home (and preferably has experience with working from home). Our company doesn’t have a centralized office – we might sometime in the future, but we’ll still work around employees that work from home.</p></li><li><p>You’ll have a place to work consistently Monday – Friday (whether it’s a quiet apartment or a noisy coffee shop) that’s best environment for you to work comfortably and productively.</p></li><li><p>You can be available by chat/slack/skype during the afternoon time on the East Coast of the U.S. (Note: you don’t necessarily have to live in the East Coast of the U.S.)</p></li><li><p>You have experience in C/C++ and maybe some other languages (C/C++ is a great basis to learn other languages as you need them). You’ll be working mostly with LimeLM / TurboActivate / TurboFloat and any other spin-off products. So, you’ll primarily be writing in C/C++ and PHP. You’ll also need SQL experience (something that’s learnable on-the-job).</p></li><li><p>You’re truly a self-starter (meaning we don’t have to feed you tasks to do) with common sense. We’ll have broad checklist of things to do, we’ll have short term goals and longer term goals, and we’ll have things that just need to get done but aren’t necessarily on any checklist. You’re the kind of person that doesn’t need to need to wait for direction, you’ll just move on to the next task at hand.</p></li></ol><p><strong>What’s great about working for wyDay:</strong></p><ol><li><p>You’d have a large amount of latitude about how you choose to solve problems, the tools you use, the tools you create- our culture is flexible and freewheeling but still focused on a great end result.</p></li><li><p>The code you write will immediately touch millions of end-users world-wide. No more toiling in obscurity, alone and unappreciated.</p></li><li><p>You can retire your collection of Dockers or uncomfortable high heels. How and where you do your work- and what you wear- is up to you. Forget fancy offices that are designed to seem hip- we don’t make you go to work, we bring work to you.</p></li></ol><p>If this sounds great to you, email us at <a href=&quot;mailto:employment@wyday.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>employment@wyday.com</a> and tell us a bit about yourself (i.e. experience, projects you’re proud of, any open source projects you’ve worked on if applicable, etc.).

We believe that a passionate and talented developer can learn new practices and technologies. Similarly, we don't place a lot of importance on educational background - as a developer your experience, portfolio, and abilities are key, not your grades :). We do need to see some experience of working in web development and creating or contributing to web applications.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>LESS</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>CoffeeScript</li><li>Knockout.js</li><li>Gulp</li><li>Git</li><li>Require.js</li><li>Bower</li><li>Go</li><li>ColdFusion</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Redis</li><li>Vagrant/Docker</li></ul><p>Our entire team works daily with HTML, CSS/LESS, JavaScript (particularly Knockout.js),RESTful APIs, and integrations, and so, experience in full stack web development is important. However, if you are particularly skilled in front-end developent or you are a highly experienced back-end developer, we'd love to hear from you.</p><p><strong>More Info</strong></p><p>Teamwork Projects is our flagship product and is used by many of the world's biggest companies, with over 370,000 installations, two million daily users and more than three million unique projects. Despite the vast array of features available in Teamwork Projects, it has been built entirely by a small team of talented developers. We pride ourselves on giving our users what they need and are constantly working on new features and improvements for our customers.</p><p>By joining our team, you can be assured not only that your work will be seen and enjoyed by millions of users worldwide, but that you will learn and grow continuously, in a friendly, open environment.</p><p><em>We care about all our teams, and they care about when their teammates will be online, what their timezone is and where they will be working from. When you apply we will ask you about where you intend to work from. We will also ask you whether or not you are open to considering spending some time in our Irish office, if you would like to work remotely, if you would like to relocate or if you're already here and ready to start work at Teamwork HQ in Cork, Ireland.</em></p>            </div>        </div>            <h3>                Skills &amp; Requirements            </h3>            <div><p><strong>Must Have:</strong></p><p><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Much of your work is front-end focused and customer-facing, so it's important that you are confident in your abilities and able to contribute to new and existing features. While we work in&nbsp;<em>Knockout.js</em>, it isn't pivotal that you are experienced in any particular framework, although knowledge of any popular&nbsp;<em>MV*</em> framework is hugely beneficial.</p><p><strong>Coding best practices</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>We work closely as a team on many features, so writing clean and extensible code is a must. Your code should be easy to debug, while you code, you consider the impact your work has on other developers, the product in general, and our testing department.</p><p><strong>RESTful API experience:</strong> We currently have an extensive API, which is constantly evolving and growing. Therefore, experience in designing and/or integrating with APIs is extremely important to us. Our application is data-driven, so you should be aware of how to work with large collections of data while maintaining a great user experience.</p><p><strong>The right attitude:</strong> We want you to take as much pride in your work as we do and strive to find the right solutions for our customers. The right applicant should be able to think on his or her feet and adapt to new technologies.</p><p><strong>Help us grow and improve:&nbsp;</strong>At Teamwork.com, we are always open to new ideas and, more importantly, open to change. We are aware that new technologies and approaches will come along that need to be embraced. As a Teamwork.com Developer, your voice rings loud and, if you know of ways that we can improve, we want to hear your ideas.</p><p><strong>Nice to Have:</strong></p><p><strong>CoffeeScript</strong></p><p><strong>Build tools:&nbsp;</strong>Gulp, Grunt, Lineman.js, etc.</p><p><strong>Front-end testing</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Go/ColdFusion:&nbsp;</strong>Our API is written in <em>Go</em>&nbsp;and <em>ColdFusion</em>. As we build new features, we often need to update our API. Having experience in either <em>Go</em>&nbsp;or <em>ColdFusion</em> would help you hit the ground running.</p><p><strong>Responsive/Adaptive applications:</strong> Having experience in building responsive or adaptive web applications is a big plus.</p><p><strong>Samples of your work:&nbsp;</strong>Do you contribute to open source communities?

For eight straight years after opening our law firm we grew gross revenues 40% a year until well, we didn't. During this same eight-year period, we grew our payroll at about 40% to handle the increased volume. I told myself during this youthful time I was being a shrewd business owner and the reason I wasn't personally more financially successful was because I </p><p>was reinvesting the revenues into the business. The truth was I mistakenly thought growth would fix all our problems. In 2012 I woke up after seeing revenues significantly decline, not having enough money to routinely pay myself, and quickly realized our lack of systems was the real chokehold on our success. </p><p>With seven offices handling multiple practice areas I worked at a level of complexity that was exhausting. It isn't accurate to say our firm was without systems, but in 2012 we felt like a body builder who is all upper body with tiny legs. Our muscle was a well-developed marketing strategy, and our legs were the systems that supported the firm. </p><p>It took us two years to shore up our infrastructure with deep practice, expert advice, and solutions we borrowed from other industries. We attended multiple guru events, hired numerous consultants, and our audible business library grew quite large. What we learned was to fall in love with the process of systematizing. Why else write this? We love it. 80/20 is what it's all about. Getting a disproportionate return on your investment should be the reward of every improvement. </p><p>We continue to get guidance from several experts and do not claim to have all the answers. We share numbers with other law firms across the country and are committed to progress, not perfection. Asked if I want to grow like we did before, I would say no. Marketing and infrastructure go hand in hand. At whatever speed you can grow both together, make it happen. Disciplined Practices is about doing the right stuff consistently that continually builds momentum.</p></div></div><div></div></div></div></div>",

We’ve helped over 15 million people from over 150 countries attend live events, and we’re just getting started. We believe creative individuals with innovative ideas are the engine for our rapid growth, so we’re looking for the world’s smartest front-end developers and UX designers to join our Front-End Team, where you’ll be given the freedom to make meaningful and measurable improvements impacting millions of people.</p><p>Your Role</p><p>Your role is simple – think of ways to improve our user experience and get these improvements into the hands of our users as quickly as possible. Have a feature in mind? Great! Now code it and ship it, all in the same day. We deploy fast and often, and you’ll be given full autonomy to test your own ideas with direct access to data on how your changes impact our millions of users around the world. You will not be a user researcher, a designer, a developer, a copywriter or an analyst; you will be the best of all of them, because if you have a great idea, we believe you are best suited to own it from start to finish. So you won’t be assigned your work; you’re going to be the one creating it.</p><p>Of course you won’t be alone. You’ll be part of a small, focused and agile team of talented developers and designers just like yourself, because we believe collaboration is essential. You should thrive on the feedback and critique from your teammates and not be shy to give it in return. You should come prepared to learn new skills from veterans of the front-end and share your own unique skillset with others.</p><p>Your Skills</p><p>You get things done. You can swiftly turn an idea into a reality. That means you’re comfortable with <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>. If you have no experience, you’re eager to learn. Familiarity with JS and/or C# is a plus, but not necessary. Shipping features fast is not an excuse for sloppy code – quick and clean, not quick and dirty.</p><p>You break the rules. You know that every product is unique and UX “best practices” can hinder innovation or fall apart when users span over 150 countries and 30 languages. You know the best ideas don’t always come from books or blogs; they come from putting yourself in our users’ shoes and taking inspiration wherever you can find it.</p><p>You thrive on feedback. You don’t just come up with great ideas, you test them, and you respect that data that comes back from our users. Sometimes they will respond positively to your change and sometimes they won’t, but you won’t be discouraged. You’ll use the wealth of data available at your fingertips to understand user behaviour and find the next best idea.</p><p>You are a team player. You work not just to advance your own skills or ideas, but also to help the team and the business succeed. This means being open to feedback from others and giving it in return. It also means recognising that the best ideas might not always be your own.</p><p>Benefits</p><p>We reward strong performers with rapid career advancement. We will never hold you back from taking on more responsibility if you are capable. We host monthly, company-wide hackathons to experiment with new technologies and radical ideas. And you’ll be working in our new, beautiful office space in the heart of central London.</p><h3>How to apply</h3><a href=&quot;http://www.workatviagogo.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>www.workatviagogo.com</a>",

Our vision is to transform how SaaS tools and infrastructure are bought and sold.</p><p>Choosing SaaS and cloud infrastructure tools is difficult. If you’re a developer looking for a hosting solution, you have hundreds of options and no clear way to sift through them all. We’ve built a community of developers, engineers, CTOs, and VPEs that recommend, review, and share their technology stacks. They have significant buying power and a need for tooling and infrastructure services, from startups to large enterprises. The options they have are confusing and increasing in number by the day - they’re desperate to get help choosing the right solutions. StackShare lets technologists see all the best tools and services, who’s using them, and why.</p><p><strong>OUR TEAM:</strong></p><p>We’re a small distributed team of five, with our main office in San Francisco, CA. We believe every member of the team should own the products they build and have a say in what gets built.</p><p>Our CEO, Yonas has seen Fortune 500 companies use Gartner PDF reports to make software buying decisions when he worked at Accenture; he’s also seen startups make these decisions after joining a YC-backed startup, where he worked on product design and marketing. Yonas then took StackShare through the 500 Startups accelerator and has been leading our growth and marketing efforts. You'll be working directly with Yonas on a daily basis as part of your role.</p><p>The rest of our team comes from companies like Digital Ocean and Citrix.</p><p><strong>YOU:</strong></p><p>As Front-End Engineer, you will influence everything you see on StackShare. You'll help to shape how hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions of developers and engineers build software.</p><p>You have experience building web applications with at least two years of experience using Rails in a production environment, and at least two years using a JavaScript MVC framework (React experience is a major plus). You have experience building APIs. You hate bureaucracies and want to work at an early stage company that has very little processes. You’re comfortable taking the initiative and just building products that you want to use. As an engineer, you should love using StackShare and if you don’t, you should be excited about making it better.</p><p>You’re comfortable working on something different every day as priorities shift. You view engineering as your strongest skill but you're open to doing whatever the company needs including blog posts, customer support, and email copy. You enjoy shipping code and you believe every new feature should be treated as an experiment and measured closely, and you have the experience to prove it. You build with the following in mind: make it work ➤ make it right ➤ make it fast.</p><p><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ve got a good eye for design and UX. </li><li>You’re a StackShare user (include your profile URL in your application). </li><li>You’re familiar with almost every tool and service in StackShare’s stack (<a href=&quot;http://stackshare.io/stackshare&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://stackshare.io/stackshare</a>). </li><li>You’re a tools geek; you sign up for new tools and services just to kick the tires and satisfy your curiosity.</li></ul></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United States</p></dd>        </dl>",

Sadly, many of these deaths could have been prevented with existing best practices for quality and patient safety. A hospital’s best tool for standardizing and implementing these life-saving improvements are their written policies and procedures. </p><p>PolicyStat’s mission is to improve healthcare delivery by making those policies and procedures easier to find, access, and enhance. Our clients (across 46/50 states) use our SaaS application to ensure that this critical information is correct, their staff can find it, and that it supports regulatory compliance.</p><p>You deserve an environment with clear goals, problems that are meaningful and challenging, the autonomy necessary for creativity, and the support/resources necessary to make a dent in the universe. We want to provide you with that environment so that together, we can improve healthcare.</p><h2>Help Us Collaborate Towards Awesome</h2><p>In this role as our 5th engineer, an experienced <strong>software engineering generalist</strong>, you will be a critical part of our product team. You will spend time on all aspects related to delivering a great web application to our users.

We’ve recently been freed from the tyranny of supporting Old IE, and we’re excited for the opportunity to improve interaction for the hundreds of thousands of people that rely on PolicyStat.</p><h2>Our Development Culture</h2><p>Our current technology stack and toolkit is focused around <strong>Django</strong>, Python, Javascript, GitHub, Vagrant and Trello. We use TDD, 100% code review, pair programming, Kanban (not sprints), monthly OKRs, and continuous delivery to manage our development process. We're jumping on the <strong>React + GraphQL</strong> bandwagon and testing the #serverless waters with Zappa. We really enjoy building things for people, so we deploy to production multiple times per day (~650 times in 2016). We're committed to contributing back to <strong>open source</strong> as both the right thing to do and the best way to do business.</p><p>We get excited about continual process improvement and <strong>helping each other become better engineers</strong>.</p><h2>Totally Strict Job Requirements</h2><p>There are none, though The Perfect Candidate™ will have:</p><ul><li>Experience building real web applications for real people using a web framework like Django or Rails</li><li>Experience using React, Redux, and ES6</li><li>A passion for the craft of creating beautiful code</li><li>An understanding of the trade-offs involved with TDD and pairing</li><li>A GitHub profile with lots of code and experience contributing to open source projects</li><li>An innate hunger for information on the web, software engineering, and entrepreneurship</li></ul><h2>About PolicyStat</h2><p>PolicyStat is a rapidly-growing SaaS company (~50% annual growth over the last 6 years) with a product our clients love (&gt;99% renewal rate).

WeÃ¢Â Â re a small, smart team focused on delighting our customers and responsibly building a lasting company -- and our track record of growth proves it. We're the market leader in our space, we operate in six major metro areas, and we're growing fast. We value communication, transparency, give-a-damn-ness, and a strong bias toward freedom &amp; responsibility over big company hierarchies and processes.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>ROLE</b></div><div><br></div><div><span>As a product development team, we hold one another to a high bar. Expect to be challenged, learn, teach, and -- like all of us here -- grow in how you work, the tools/processes you use, your technical acumen as an engineer and as a mentor, and the quality and speed of your output. Growth is a part of our DNA, and you'll bring something to the table, too. Working with us means youÃ¢Â Â ll gain the confidence, knowledge, and experience you need to build and run your own product company.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>What you'll do:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Own what you build - working across the entire stack (python on the back end; javascript on the front end)<br></li><li>Delight internal and external customers with amazing UX<br></li><li>Build microservices from scratch and improve existing microservices<br></li><li>Collaborate with and mentor other engineers on architecture, code, and process<br></li><li>Incubate and contribute to our open-source projects that magnify our team's effectiveness</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Some technical challenges we're cracking away at:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>An ML pipeline to match customers with the best recommendations<br></li><li>A predictive model for customer retention and happiness<br></li><li>State of the art web and mobile apps to give our users more power and flexibility<br></li><li>A loosely coupled microservices architecture</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>&nbsp;You</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>A pragmatic, customer-first mindset<br></li><li>A curious, determined, self-motivated personality (we'd love to see your side projects)<br></li><li>We love founders and engineers who have joined early stage companies<br></li><li>Fluent across the entire stack, from the database all the way up to the browser<br></li><li>5+ years experience as an engineer with a generalist/full-stack bent<br></li><li>Advanced knowledge in either python, ruby, or javascript</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>WHY JOIN US?</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>When you walk in the door, one of the first things youÃ¢Â Â ll notice is the vibe of casual collaboration as teams solve problems and work over ideas at whiteboards, couches, and kitchen tables -- and probably see a puppy wandering around, too. Come at lunch and see people chatting around the tables with an amazing spread from one of our local catering partners downstairs and a yoga class going on upstairs. A few things you wonÃ¢Â Â t find at ZeroCater: office politics, apathetic people, unethical leadership, sad gray cubicles, and isolated teams that donÃ¢Â Â t talk to one another.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We recognize that diversity + openness makes us better as a community so you'll also see that, unlike most tech companies, we actually walk the walk: weÃ¢Â Â re 62% female and 43% non-Caucasian. Applicants are considered without regards to race, color, religion, national origin, age,s ex, marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or other protected statuses.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q&amp;A</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. What is your technical architecture like?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. We largely work with a bleeding-edge microservices architecture. Services are decoupled and talk to one another by broadcasting events over a shared message bus. Most of our back-end services are either python/django or node.js with postgres databases, hosted on Heroku.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. What development environment do you use?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. All our developers currently use MacOS, but youÃ¢Â Â re free to use whatever platform you wish. Our development environment runs in a docker container and is built with a single command line.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. What is your development workflow like?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. Our typical development workflow includes committing unit-tested code to branches, creating pull requests for code reviews, automated linting &amp; CI. `master` branches are always deployable. Because weÃ¢Â Â re building a robust engineering culture, these processes arenÃ¢Â Â t dictated by management -- instead, the team debates alternatives and decides on the workflows that support its objectives.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. WhatÃ¢Â Â s your engineering culture like?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. WeÃ¢Â Â re a tight-knit bunch. ItÃ¢Â Â s not to say we donÃ¢Â Â t have our disagreements -- like every team, we have those too. But we live a culture of service: if you need a hand, someone always has your back. Why does a culture of service make us stronger? Because it creates stability and helps us learn from one another. Also, we often get together for dinner (outside of work), board games at lunch, hikes, and we also host poker nights for the entire company.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Q. Why should I work at ZeroCater over Company X?</b></span><br></div><div><span>A. Small team at a cultural inflection point. Thoughtful people who give a damn. Leadership with proven track records. Chunky problems you can really sink your teeth into. The chance to mentor and be mentored. A company with a proven business model. The chance to embiggen the pie for everyone.</span><br></div><div></div><p><strong>To apply:</strong> Apply online at <a href=&quot;https://boards.greenhouse.io/zerocater/jobs/501865&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://boards.greenhouse.io/zerocater/jobs/501865</a></p>",

Excellent technical experts, visionary designers, dynamic and communicative Human Resources team, innovative researchers, magical marketers, entrepreneurial managers. [These are](https://youtu.be/lCHvRN4SPW8) the people that are part of Xpand IT.**ABOUT THE JOB**We are looking for a superb **Front-end Developer**. But, more than just a Developer, we seek a Ninja Engineer in advanced Rich Interfaces.We are looking for someone who is able to use agile methodologies to deliver high-quality and high-performance web application. Almost anyone can program with javascript but few are the ones that use it correctly in a structured manner. We donÃ¢Â Â t pretend to reinvent the wheel, so itÃ¢Â Â s important to know already some of the mainstream frameworks that already do some of the Ã¢Â Â hard stuffÃ¢Â Â  such as Angular.js or React. ItÃ¢Â Â s important to have some knowledge and concern about the final User experience (so many times neglected).A typical day of a Frontend Developer will go from build component oriented and responsive web applications and, as a team member, work with designers and software engineers to ship highly visual products. The technical skills are important, but he should also value the soft skills. Present a proof of concept, discuss requirements with the team, set priorities and appropriate delivery time, being able to share knowledge with the team and produce quality documentation are skills we expect but we will also help to develop.<div>    </div>",

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to actually have them code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><br><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><br><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><br><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here: <a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><br><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><br><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><br><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><br><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><br><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><br><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><br><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><br><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><br><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><br><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no e-mail checking) but some take more and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements everything else works itself out.</p><br><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><br><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><br><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><br><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><br><p>We have partial test coverage and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><br><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR.</p><br><p>We can one click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><br><p>We can one click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><br><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><br><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><br><p>We work off weekly sprint issue lists in Github.</p><br><p>Our developers float between mobile, desktop and web development. Our future engineers can specialize&nbsp;in one area if that's where their passion is.</p><br><p>Developers get the latest tricked out MacBook Pro and a powerful desktop tower and choice of monitor(s). If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><br><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><br><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self taught.</p><br><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><br><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><br><p>If you did follow directions our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done 'blind'; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code is code and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><br><p>If we like you're refactoring we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. &nbsp;Nothing super deep CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><br><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up with a team interview.</p><br><p>If the team likes you; we'll then setup a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><br><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><br><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to 'your level' in terms of 'get-shit-doneness'.</p><br><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><br><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><br><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not 'doing their dishes' or causing extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><br><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><br><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.</p>",

    "title": "Front-End Developer",
    "content": "**Work from anywhere, flexible-hours, part-time or full-time position**<br /><br />The Podcast Host ltd. are looking for a front-end developer to join the team. We’re a little company looking to grow, and a new Software as a Service (SAAS) project is a big part of that plan. Our new front-end dev will play a huge part in building that tool, and solving a deep problem that our audience experience.<br /><br />Currently, the business revolves around content and teaching. We write, blog and, of course, Podcast, about podcasting. The aim is to help anyone (hobbyists to businesses) to start, run and grow a show. We have a tonne of free content that offers that advice, and a range of paid courses (sold as a premium upgrade) which go much more in-depth.<br /><br />Next, we want to offer a software product that cures one of the biggest pains that afflicts our audience. This application will offer the tools to make Podcasting (and media production in general) much more easy – even for non-techies – and a workflow to save hours each week.<br /><br />We’ve developed a prototype web application which works. It already solves many of the problems we want to tackle. That prototype is operated, right now, through a command-line type interface. The purpose of this project is to develop the front-end system which allows an average user to work with the application.<br /><br />Technical Skills<br /><br />The core aim of this role is to create a dashboard which allows anyone to use the already-developed back-end system. Within this dashboard we have a range of requirements, from standard button-push, drop-down controlled sections, to heavily designed, interactive HTML5 interfaces which allow people to drag/drop/interact with the workflow.<br /><br />On top of the dashboard above, we’ll also be building a great public facing site, which handles the sales funnel, ecommerce, subscriptions and member management. Our front-end developer will take charge of all of this, and work closely with our existing back-end dev to create the interface.<br /><br />In terms of the tech you need to know, the backend system is accessed through a JSON based RESTful API. You will need:<br /><br />Strong Javascript Knowledge<br />HTML5 media components<br />HTML5 Canvas<br />Interfacing with a RESTful API<br />WordPress and Bootstrap experience<br />Some knowledge of audio and video codecs<br />Working knowledge of HTTP inspection tools<br />ie, Fiddler, Charles<br />NodeJS experience would be useful but not required<br />Media production experience is desirable but not required<br /><br />Softer Skills<br /><br />The big challenge here is creating an interface to allow our average user to carry out a set of quite complex tasks with their media. We need to let them do this in a really simple and easy way.<br /><br />I’m looking for someone who will enjoy this creative challenge. I need you to help me rethink a process that currently intimidates or repels a large number of the people we work with. If you have experience in working with media, then that may be an advantage. Or, it might even be a disadvantage – we want to get away from existing ways of thinking.<br /><br />In short, we need:<br /><br />A creative mind, able to rethink and redesign an age-old process<br />A passion for making things simple, simple, simple<br />A real aptitude for great UX design and creating intuitive workflows<br />If you have a genuine interest in podcast, even better!<br /><br />The Details<br /><br />We are a company based in Dundee, Scotland, but we’re willing to work with someone at a distance on this one. You can work from anywhere within the UK (UK residents only I’m afraid). If you did want to move to Dundee, of course, you’re welcome to join us! It’s a great and growing place for digital media, tech and games right now.<br /><br />Working hours are also flexible. We need a commitment to at least 3 days per week, so we can grow some momentum on this. If you’re interested in full-time, then that’s great too. We need daytime working – any time between 8 and 6, Monday to Friday – so this isn’t for someone already in a full-time job, looking for evening or weekend work.<br /><br />The salary for this role depends entirely on experience. We have the option to go with an experienced front-end developer, and the upper end of our scale (25 - 32k). Or, we would consider a graduate with the enthusiasm to make the job their own, starting at a lower level (15.5 - 18). Either way, once the app launches, we’ll be growing the team. That means our existing developers will move up quickly and salary will increase an line with app traction and responsibility. We’re also open to a bit of negotiation on that for people with really extensive experience (including the possibility of equity or partnership, for the really right person…).",

    "content": "BounceIt is a social media app based around the six degrees of separation- the notion that you can be linked to anyone in six steps or less. To utilise this concept in a social media app, we have created a function called ‘bouncing’. Any time you send content to a friend on BounceIt, they can ‘Bounce’ this content on to their friends, who can bounce the content on to their friends and so on and so forth. Using GPS, we can track the path of this photo as it travels around the world. For example, you take a photo and send it to your friends in France and Spain, who bounce it to friends in Germany, Hong Kong and Peru. Without leaving the couch, your media has travelled around the world without you leaving the couch.<br /> <br />Tied in with this is gamification. Users can compete against their friends in live leaderboards, collect trophies to display on their profile and complete challenges to gain experience. Although it is not implemented into the app yet, we plan on having a huge amount of customisability- from themed profiles based on achievements to customisable maps based on distance travelled/ countries visited.<br /> <br />In November, we received £112.5k funding as a proof of concept project, and are less than a month off soft launching, with the aim of a full launch late April. In a few months, we have grown our team from one hugely passionate full time employee to 4 hugely passionate employees. We have a digital director who is currently part time, however we need a full time front end developer.<br /><br />Another project we are currently working on is an agency we are opening, specialising in website and app building, optimisation, CMS and ecommerce. Part of your role will be working with clients to build bespoke solutions for them, to keep cash flow positive. <br /> <br />*The role- Web Developer*<br />We are looking for a web developer to join BounceIt. Due to being a social media app, there are a few reasons why we need a designer; The first is that we are aware that our user interface has changes that need made, and once we have soft launched, there will be more changes that need made. A full time front end developer will allow us to make these changes as quickly as possible. A new corporate side to our website needs built, as does an ambassador page.<br /> <br />*So why BounceIt?*<br />• We are in one of the most exciting and fast moving industries today and with the right idea (which we believe we have) the payoff could be huge.<br />• The variety in our team is massive. Both our CEO and COO are 22. Our Technical Director and Digital Director both have over 20 years of experience and our chairman has boarded 6 companies and led a successful one for 15 years. This brings the perfect blend of youth and experience. <br />• As well as having a social media application, BounceIt is viable as a marketing tool, something that has been validated by Microsoft Education, Forza Motorsports and RBS, along with other smaller companies.<br /> <br />*Responsibilities*<br />• Constantly updating the user interface according to the customer feedback <br />• Building the front end of a corporate section of our website<br />• Illustrations, infographics and images for our social media and blogs<br />• Collaborating with the rest of the team to complete other projects<br /> <br />*Skills Required*<br />• HTML/HTML 5<br />• CSS/CSS3<br />• JavaScript/JQuery <br />• Design skills <br />• Attention to detail <br />• Artistic flair<br /> <br />*Skills Optional/Beneficial*<br />• CMS/Umbraco <br />• MVC/Razor/.NET Web Forms",

    "title": "Junior Full-Stack Developer",
    "content": "THE COMPANY<br />weseethrough is a tech-driven market research startup. We’re less than two years old, and we’ve already won large contracts from big-name clients like Unilever and we won the 2015 MRS award for innovation in research methodology. Business is booming.<br /><br />We help our clients understand their consumers’ real behaviour: how they use their products, how they interact with advertising, how they perceive brands. Traditionally this has been done through surveys and focus groups, or sending researchers to participants’ homes as they use cleaning or food products etc. These approaches have major drawbacks:<br /><br />Reported behaviour and actual behaviour can be very different. People might claim they only add one teaspoonful of salt, but they actually add three… or they think they take 20 minutes to clean a room, but actually take 40.<br /><br />Sending a researcher to observe someone in their homes as they use a product is expensive, and it’s hard to get participants to relax and act naturally when there’s a stranger watching them!<br />We address these issues by giving participants wearable devices like Google Glass or GoPro to wear as they perform activities like cooking or cleaning. We use these devices to record hundreds of hours of first-person video. We then use our Haystack platform to find the 0.1% of the footage that’s insightful: the moments which help our clients better understand their customers.<br /><br />We’ve conducted these studies in >20 countries across five continents; from Tokyo to Lagos to Moscow to Milan. To give an example, we had a client in Brazil who wanted to understand why their recently-launched house cleaning products were not selling well. To investigate, we got participants to clean their homes with Google Glass. As well as recording video and audio, our custom Glass software posed pre-recorded Portuguese interview questions as they went around their homes, using proximity beacons in each room to ask the right questions at the right time. We were able to use the recordings to write a report for a client giving deep insights into common behaviours, and a few quirks you wouldn’t think to ask about, like participants throwing buckets of undiluted bleach over their floors without moving furniture out of the way!<br />A more detailed example in this case study.<br /><br />OUR PLATFORM<br />Our platform is all about how to mine video from market research studies for interesting, insightful content. Other platforms focus on interview videos, where someone describes their experiences with a product or service – as such, such platforms focus on transcribing the video.<br />Rather than reported behaviour from interviews, we focus on consumers’ actual behaviour using GoPros on chest- or headstraps, Google Glass, movement sensors, eye tracking glasses, and other biometric sensors. Like our competitors, we subtitle videos, but that’s not enough to understand participants’ behaviour. So our platform allows us to mark things that *happen* in the videos, like a stock cube being chopped in half or two cleaning products being mixed together, and things like the products that are seen on screen.<br />Much of our video analysis is done by the crowd at present – a key technical challenge for us is how to best leverage recent leaps and bounds in machine vision to automate video tagging.<br /><br />THE ROLE<br />The role is twofold:<br /><br />1. Devops.<br />Our platform is split between:<br />A pair of dedicated Linux servers (prod + test), running node.js, a lot of batch video processing with ffmpeg, and a bit of data in Redis<br />AWS<br />Also, often when we receive a lot of videos from a client for processing, the project managers need a helping hand organising it.<br /><br />2. Full-stack dev and fix.<br />We’re looking to incrementally rewrite our platform, which currently uses Angular 1.3 and node.js. We have a variety of user types (end clients, researchers, crowd video taggers and transcribers, project managers, video uploaders…) that we want to migrate to a new platform we’re starting to build with ReactJS, one user type at a time. We’re going to have a relatively protracted transition period where both run in parallel, so part of the role will be about patching up the old, part of it will be about creating the new.<br /><br />CULTURE<br /><br />We’re a small startup, and it’s crucial that you’re comfortable with all that that means!<br />You’ll have a lot of responsibility early on, and if you do a good job you’ll see a real difference to how the company is doing.<br /><br />We’re likely to ask you to go outside your comfort zone and perform tasks outside a narrow reading of your job specification.<br /><br />Lateral thinking and problem solving for unfamiliar tasks are hugely valued here.<br />There’s no room for big egos here! In large companies, it’s possible for an individual to do well as the company flounders – here, we all make a success of the company, or… we don’t.<br />We want someone who is hungry to work in a startup in general, and our company in particular. Startups have a very different culture from large corporates and you should have a clear idea of this going in, even if you’ve not worked for a startup before.<br /><br />REQUIRED SKILLSET<br />Linux system administration (we use Ubuntu)<br />HTML & CSS<br />Angular 1.x or React or both<br />ES5<br />Deep understanding of Chrome developer tools<br /><br />NICE TO HAVE (can learn on the job)<br />ES2015 / ES6+<br />node.js<br />AWS – currently we use S3, CloudFront, EC2; may start using Elastic Transcoder and others in future<br />Build automation tooling (we’re using Bamboo)<br />git<br />Redis<br />ffmpeg / video processing<br />JIRA<br />Performance test experience",

    "content": "<div>                  <span>Wisdom | Cryptocurrency Applied to APIs | Moraga, CA | REMOTE/ONSITE | Founder<p>Wisdom is a project-in-progress I have been working on for a few years which applies cryptopayments to API method calls to implement the <i>402 Payment Required</i> response code for HTTP based requests using Bitcoin or other cyptocurrencies, which will eventually add support for the Lightning Protocol. A PoC of an early version of the idea was featured here on HN 3 years ago: <a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8069386&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8069386</a>. Time has passed since then and the idea, and technologies required for building it, have evolved. It is my belief the time for this idea, from a market-perspective, has arrived.</p><p>The service will be designed to improve the process of integrating a company's API product with channel partners, either on-prem or in a hosted manner, with the intent to increase pass-through revenue on the API calls a company provides, while providing a simple federated layer based on blochchain backed data structures. This idea is in pre-funding, so I'm explicitly stating anyone interested in my idea should consider their founder-level involvement as purely self-choice driven. Influencing, making or removing choice for you in this regard is illogical and irrational, given the state of the company (non-existent) and funding (also non-existent). However, if you hold the view that the existing methods for securing the Internet's infrastructure are woefully inadequate and you feel applying cryptocurrency to APIs could make companies more money by securing them against use by limiting calls with payments, then you should contact me and we should have a conversation about it.</p><p>Expertise in building scalable API calls with microservices-based architecture is desired, but a more general gift in development is also welcome. I code in Python, Javascript and C++, and am decently good at running infrastructure, given my history. My primary function is strategy, operations and architecture. I do not visualize, so I tend to communicate differently.</p><p>My email address is in my profile here on HN. Happy to just discuss the idea, if you are interested, as opposed to any expectation of finding someone this early on to join me.</p><p>If you've read this far, I appreciate you. I will note that this idea can be applied to AI in a less than obvious way. This reason is the primary purpose of the project, but making revenue in other ways first remains important.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                        </p></div></span></div>",

It's open source and free and uses React Native. Several of our engineers are core contributors to React Native, and we regularly collaborate with Facebook and other companies on the direction of the framework.</p><p>Our technology is built around an Android/iOS application which allows developers to load their JavaScript projects on the fly with no native build dependencies. Out of the box, developers using Expo get access to native mobile APIs like push notifications, camera, maps, and more (<a href=&quot;https://docs.getexponent.com/versions/v15.0.0/sdk/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://docs.getexponent.com/versions/v15.0.0/sdk/index.html</a>).</p><p>We have a lot of irons in the fire, and we're looking for engineers who can comfortably own and work on multiple projects. Some examples of recent projects at Expo:</p><p>* Creating cross-platform APIs (like our new WebGL implementation) that provide developers native mobile functionality within JavaScript</p><p>* Building Snack (<a href=&quot;https://snack.expo.io&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://snack.expo.io</a>), a JSFiddle-esque tool for React Native</p><p>* Designing and implementing a community front-end to explore applications built on Expo</p><p>* Building the foundation of a scalable infrastructure to host our take on a new mobile web</p><p>Some projects that are underway or on the horizon for us:</p><p>* Greatly expanding the functionality available in our SDK's API</p><p>* Improved monitoring and alerting for our infrastructure</p><p>* Increasing our test coverage and improving overall reliability</p><p>Some buzzwords: React Native, JavaScript (ES6/ES7, Flow), Android, iOS, Node.js, Electron, Go, Kubernetes, Google Cloud.We don't expect candidates to already be proficient in these, but it's what we're currently using day-to-day.</p><p>Please send an email to jobs@expo.io and mention this post if you'd like to start a conversation with us. Definitely include links to any applicable resources: resume/CV, your blog, GitHub profile, recent projects or open source contributions, etc. Typical interviews with us include remote pairing, small take-home projects (1-2 hours), and we usually finish with some more traditional in-person interviews.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                        </p></div></span></div>",

We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. We started with Ruby on Rails on our backend, and have lately been working to introduce Elixir to our stack. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]</p><p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.</p><p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using OpsWorks and Chef. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re hiring both engineers who have been around the block many times, as well as those who started their careers just a couple years ago. We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.</p><p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].</p><p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href=&quot;https://www.noredink.com/jobs&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://www.noredink.com/jobs</a></p><p>[1] <a href=&quot;https://www.noredink.com/about/team&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://www.noredink.com/about/team</a></p><p>[2] <a href=&quot;http://tech.noredink.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://tech.noredink.com/</a></p><p>[3] <a href=&quot;https://github.com/NoRedInk/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>https://github.com/NoRedInk/</a></p><p>[4] <a href=&quot;http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan</a></p><p>[5] <a href=&quot;http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...</a></p><p>[6] <a href=&quot;http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Im letzten dreiviertel Jahr haben wir mit JavaScript, NodeJS, ArangoDB, D3.JS, PHP und Wordpress schon eine sehr mächtige Plattform gebaut, die viele verschiedene Funktionalitäten abdeckt (daher auch die Mischung aus einem Wordpress/PHP Teil und einem größeren JS Stack). Teil der Weiterentwicklung ab April/Mai ist u.a. die Text Extraction und der Business Model Extractor, die eine automatische Analyse von Business Plänen und Geschäftsberichten ermöglichen soll. Der Kunde ist ein großes und renommiertes Consulting Unternehmen.</p><p>Das bestehende Team aus 4 Entwicklern soll durch eine(n) Fullstack JavaScript Entwickler ergänzt werden.

In den letzten Sessions haben wir u.a. mit HTC Vive, SLAM Technologie, Vuforia und Amazon Alexa experimentiert. Das macht die Arbeit bei Motius einzigartig.</p>            </div>                        <p><em>                    The <a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Joel Test</a> is a twelve-question measure of the quality of a software team.                </em>            </p>                                    </div>",

Dafür setzen wir stets auf neueste Techniken und prüfen, was noch weiter vereinfacht werden kann.</p><p><br>Euer Aufgabengebiet:<br>• Für den Anfang: Bauen von kleinen Anwendungen, die unsere API nutzen, für das iPhone/iPad sowie Android und Mac OS X</p><p>Wir bieten:<br>• Flexible Arbeitseinteilung, um Uni, Prüfungsvorbereitungszeiten und Job unter einen Hut zu bekommen<br>• Die Möglichkeit, selbständig von zu Hause aus zu arbeiten (aber auch gerne bei uns im Büro)<br>• Eine unbefristete Anstellung<br>• Die Arbeit in einem netten und dynamischen Team mit flachen Hierarchien<br>•&nbsp;Einen Stundenlohn zwischen 15,- und 20,- Euro</p><p>&nbsp;•&nbsp;Einen Stundenlohn zwischen</p>            </div>        </div>            <h3>                Skills &amp; Requirements            </h3>            <div><p>Euer Profil:<br>• Gute Kenntnisse in Objective-C und/oder Swift/Java<br>• Gewissenhaftes und selbständiges Arbeiten<br>• Kleine Referenzentwicklungen (können auch gerne Uni-Projekte sein), die uns einen Einblick in eure Erfahrungen geben<br>• Interesse an der Entwicklung für Android und iOS<br>• Ihr könnt uns 16-20 Stunden pro Woche unterstützen</p>            </div>            <h3>                About SecCommerce Informationssysteme GmbH            </h3>            <div><p>Über uns:<br>SecCommerce wurde 1998 in Hamburg gegründet und entwickelt seither Softwareprodukte hauptsächlich im Bereich der digitalen Signatur sowie der Public-Key-Infrastruktur.<br>Seit ca. vier Jahren entwickeln wir das SecSign Portal und die SecSign ID; ein Webportal für die sichere Online-Zusammenarbeit und eine Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung für die sichere Benutzeranmeldung mit dem Smartphone. Beide Lösungen können sowohl im Web als auch als Inhouse-Installation genutzt werden. Durch unsere Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung haben wir aber auch zahlreiche Berührungspunkte mit den aktuell wichtigsten CMS und Webservices (WordPress, Atlassian (JIRA, Confluence, Crowd), Typo3, Joomla asp.net, u.v.m.)</p><p><br>Unser Ziel ist es, weitere spannende Applikationen (für den Desktop sowie auch mobile) mit dem Schwerpunkt auf benutzbare IT-Sicherheit zu entwickeln. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist die Integration der Touch ID von Apple (s. auch <a href=&quot;http://www.iphone-ticker.de/touch-id-statt-online-login-ios-8-machts-moeglich-69123/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://www.iphone-ticker.de/touch-id-statt-online-login-ios-8-machts-moeglich-69123</a>) in die SecSign ID. Somit kann jeder Entwickler mithilfe der Plugins den Nutzern seiner Webseite oder seiner Programme eine Authentifizierung mit der Touch ID ermöglichen.</p><p><br>Einen kleinen Einblick in unsere neuen Produkte erhaltet ihr unter<br>secsign.com<br>portal.secsign.com</p>            </div>                        <p><em>                    The <a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Joel Test</a> is a twelve-question measure of the quality of a software team.                </em>            </p>                                    </div>",

We are the industry leading provider in email message quality. There are over 100,000 worldwide customers using our platform. When we started this company, email development was anything but easy. The internet was full of resources for web developers, but we could hardly find anything to help email developers. So we set out to create a service that would make it easy to find and fix email problems, and give developers and marketers a place to talk about email. We love email (obviously), and are dedicated to making email testing and marketing as simple as possible.</p><p>Benefits:</p><ul><li>Great People to work with</li><li>Open PTO</li><li>Flexible Work Hours</li><li>401K with Matching</li><li>Medical/Vision/Dental</li><li>Weekly Catered Lunches</li><li>Company sponsored Happy Hours</li><li>Company Outings</li></ul>            </div>                        <p><em>                    The <a href=&quot;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Joel Test</a> is a twelve-question measure of the quality of a software team.                </em>            </p>                                    </div>",

You will be assigned tasks, both small and large, and a general time frame, but given the autonomy and freedom to schedule your own daily tasks as long as you complete what needs to get done. We understand and respect that you know development better than we do and it’s not our place to call unnecessarily strict or irrational deadlines and ways of completing tasks. This may be a good place to add that you should, when applying, mention your favorite food and, if you’re feeling ambitious, include a picture: this is to weed out applicants who mindlessly apply en masse to listings.</p><br><p>Given the above mentioned autonomy and freedom, you will be expected to debrief with a daily summary of what was accomplished, problems you ran into, what’s planned for the coming days, and maybe a joke or two. :)</p><br><p>We are a fun, friendly, and closely knit team, and although geographically distant, we have a strong work ethos and communicate regularly allowing for a very friendly and efficient work environment. Being a part of a new division within an established company, you get the best of both worlds in terms of job security and company culture. We work hard and expect the same from all of our team members.</p><br><p>We work hard, but we also play hard. You should come with a great sense of humor and a smile on your face, because you’ll have a few laughs and enjoy your time working with us.

We’ll expect you to feel the same way.<br />    We work in an Agile team with quick iterations, regular deployments, weekly sprints; it helps if you’ve experienced these working patterns.<br />    We’re driving towards increased automation so we expect everyone to contribute to this DevOps culture with high-visibility of application performance.<br /><br /><br />Rewards<br />You’ll receive a competitive salary, but most importantly, you will also get to own part of the business.<br />Popsa has an share options scheme that is open to all employees.<br />We’ll tell you all about it as part of the interview process",

What will you be working on - BNBHelper<br /><br />BNBHelper and its core product Zerlock is a suite of tools to help different players in the short-term holiday rental market streamline their business. The sharing-economy in real-estate has been a buzz word for the last few years and will only be increasing in its reach over the next 5 years and with increasing players in the market, there is a need for technological tools to help such market participants. BNBHelper is creating a suite of such tools<br /><br />This startup comes out of my experience in the real-estate market for last 3 years to simplify pain points for hosts in the short-term rental market in UK and abroad. It is being backed by some high net-worth property investors in UK and by BOK Construction (http://www.bokconstruction.co.uk/) a London based construction company focussing on high-end construction<br /><br />Different coding/development streams include:<br /><br />* AI engine / chat bot for replying to guest enquiries and post-booking questions faster<br />* Scraping of quasi-open data to infer market competition analysis<br />* Home automation in several different ways to have total picture of when guests check in, which rooms they use and when, improved security and improved customer-service messaging. We will play around with various Internet of Things technologies available today and pick the best ones and integrate them in our project and improve upon them<br />* A guest-composite score analysis using heavy use of scraping, machine learning and other algorithms to separate good guests from bad guests.<br />* Scaling up all of the above to a production-ready level<br /><br />There is existing code-base for all of these above but a lot of ongoing work is still necessary and in the business roadmap.<br /><br /><br />h2. Who a we looking for:<br /><br />A junior developer with “stay hungry, stay foolish” mindset, who has proven track record of “hacking” from his bedroom/dorm-room for a considerable period of time.<br /><br />You love knowing and learning new technologies and using them towards practical applications and solving real-life problems and making cool things<br /><br />Solving that nagging bug, or learning that new intricate package to fit into your codebase keeps you up till late night.<br /><br />You can think and build things from first-principles when necessary, but also know how to use existing packages and join their dots and integrate them well to the desired end.<br /><br />College-programming degree is great, but not essential. I have mentored and helped junior developers in the past to the point that they single-handedly maintain full-stack (front end + backend) code bases for actual commercial apps for well-funded startups currently, and I will be helping you out in a similar manner and you will work very closely with me (at least 3-4 hours of face to face time each day)<br /><br />You should be able pick up things fast as you will have a lot to learn. I encourage you having an aim to perhaps starting your startup within 2-3 year’s time from all the knowledge gained (tech/marketing/fund-raising) from this experience.<br /><br />If you are keen, I will be happy to expand your role to more than a developer (to help in marketing/business/fund-raise) in the near future, given your enthusiasm and ability. It is in fact encouraged.<br /><br />The job requires a good attitude towards problem-solving and debugging, and working under tight-schedule.<br /><br />You should aim to work 5-5.5 days a week, sometimes under tight schedule but when there are no pressing needs, you are welcome to work on your own projects for 1 day a week – which I will happily work with you on/mentor/advise/invest into if appealing.<br /><br />h2. Compensation - £27000 per annum equivalent<br /><br />Probationary period: 2-5 months depending on your current experience – GBP 1000 / month (net in hand)<br />Post probation – GBP 1500 / month (net in hand)<br /><br />You would have a probationary period of 3 months, post which we will have a longer term permanent engagement agreement.<br /><br />Bonus – after completion of 1 year – GBP 3500 minimum contractual (and more depending on you performance and business performance)<br /><br /><br />You can expect periodic revisions in compensation every year at least (if not earlier) and being assigned stock options after the first fund-raise of BNBHelper. Also you can expect very healthy increase after the completion of 1st year.<br /><br />If you have present commitments, for the right candidate a part-time agreement for an initial period (at a different compensation level) will also be considered till you free up to become full-time",
