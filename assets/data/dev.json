As the market leader for field service supply chain solutions in the UK, we rely on our software team to innovate and build new solutions, as well as developing our existing systems, keeping ByBox ahead of the competition and reinforcing our position as a successful innovator within UK field support.</p><p>We are also successfully re-positioning ourselves as a global technology provider for locker delivery solutions, predominantly focussing on the field service supply chain. This is an exciting departure from the previous market position as a distribution company with a strong technology capability. This change of position is allowing us to operate a different revenue model, through software subscriptions and licensing, rather than through logistics services.</p><p>To support this, the software development department must deliver the correct short and long-term projects to enable that re-positioning.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>As a Software Development Manager at ByBox your duties include:</p><p>Leadership. Lead, motivate and influence a team of expert software developers to deliver value for ByBox while ensuring software quality. Ensure the developers have all the tools they need, be it hardware, software, or training, to do their job to the required level.</p><p>Relationships. Work closely with colleagues in the software development department to ensure the development team are aligned to business priorities and strategy. Develop strong relationships with internal customers to understand their perspectives and to positively influence the reputation of software development.</p><p>Recruitment. Take a highly pro-active role in the recruitment of software developers. Work with the ByBox recruitment team to ensure the highest-quality candidates are identified and engaged effectively. Also, engage with external organisations to seek the right talent and to promote ByBox as a forward-thinking employer of software developers.</p><p>Resourcing. Work closely with the Business Interface Manager and Project Managers to ensure the right developers are available at the right time for delivering the Software Development Pipeline. Where necessary, own the relationship with outsourced-development teams and the process for bringing on additional software developers on a temporary-contract basis. Ensure the software developers are appropriately assigned to projects, and given opportunities to work on other projects as required and fairly. Respond to business needs through the appropriate deployment of developers, while protecting long-term contingency in capacity so we can quickly respond to opportunities.</p><p>People development. Develop and retain our people by fostering a positive environment for personal and professional development through continuously engaging with developers, appraisals, objectives and training plans. Provide a platform for developers to raise concerns or offer new ideas, support one another, and resolve conflict, and where necessary manage performance or disciplinary concerns. Promote and develop the key values from our Ways of Working, including innovation, trust and openness.</p><p>Continuous improvement. Drive continuous improvement and adoption of best practices within the software development team to optimize the performance of the team. By pragmatically weighing the business need for delivery with the need to keeping technology current, help to ensure the team is producing the right solution at the right time.</p><p>Documentation. Define and own the good practice for technical documentation, demos, and handovers amongst the team for the benefit of colleagues, and customers requiring technical API documentation.</p><p>Technology. Support your team in ensuring they are abreast of the latest developments in technologies, and they have the tools they need to adopt appropriate technology. Be familiar with the current technologies in your team, and be aware of upcoming technologies. You do not need to be the technology expert within your team, but must be able to articulate the pros and cons of competing technologies and justify investment to senior management.</p><p>Quality Assurance. Work very closely with the Quality Assurance Manager to ensure QA practices are aligned across the department, particularly in the adoption of Test Automation and the Test Automation Engineers reporting to the QA Manager.</p><p>Workload. Manage your own objectives and priorities effectively and without close supervision. Although you won't be directly managing the work of your direct reports (this will be done by Software Project Managers), a good awareness of their current work will be crucial in making good decisions. You will be able to escalate issues to the Head of R&amp;D and will also be required to make recommendations. You will also be involved in the technology strategy by supporting the Head of R&amp;D with departmental planning activities as required.</p><p><strong>The Person</strong></p><p>The Software Development manager does not need to be currently active in writing code, and the role does not entail any code-writing, but there is room for a successful candidate to define the level of their technical involvement, based on their knowledge. The ideal candidate will:</p><ul><li>Have a passion for Technology and good understanding of trends in Software Development.</li><li>Have a strong technical foundation in Software Development.</li><li>Embrace a cross-functional approach to team management and appreciate the challenges therein.</li><li>Foster an open, collaborative environment, and balance people's needs with company objectives.</li><li>Appreciate the challenges of managing a team of home-workers, and home-working yourself.</li><li>Understand how to lead and manage a team of highly talented, distributed Software Developers.</li></ul><p><strong>Essential qualifications and experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Team Leadership or Management, particularly teams of Software Developers</li><li>Technical background.</li><li>Worked with home-working or distributed teams.</li><li>Management of outsourced development partners.</li><li>Excellent command of written and spoken English.</li></ul><p><strong>Desirable qualifications and experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience working in a team of primarily .Net &amp; JavaScript developers.</li><li>Experience in the logistics industry.</li><li>Knowledge of the ByBox domain</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About ByBox            </h2>            <div><p>ByBox is leading the way in box-based logistics.

Here is some of what you can expect working here:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>. Developers are organized into autonomous teams of 2-4 developers and have a lot of control over how they collaborate, communicate, and work in general.</li><br><li><strong>Agility</strong>. Teams practice scrum, work in sprints, calculate velocity, do code reviews and rely on Continuous Integration.</li><br><li><strong>Location Independence</strong>. Remote work is built into our company’s DNA. Half of our developers are remote!</li><br><li><strong>Craftsmanship</strong>. We have excellent engineers spanning all skill levels, and we are all committed to becoming better at our craft. We practice Lunch &amp; Learns,mentorship, and pair programming.</li><br><li><strong>Stewardship</strong>. We are big proponents of open source, use it a lot, and give back to the community wherever we can.</li><br></ul><br><p>Our 17 year old codebase is constantly evolving to incorporate modern technologies. We started with Java, moved into JRuby on Rails leveraging the Java code with JRuby, and are now incorporating React where it makes sense. We use RSpec for testing Ruby and Java, and Jest for JavaScript.</p><br><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><br><p>We care about our people, and as such are strong believers in having fun at work, continuing education and work/life/family balance. We demonstrate that in the followings ways:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong><strong>Competitive Pay</strong>. We hire excellent people and reward them accordingly.</strong></li><br><li><strong>One Paid Conference</strong> per year (including hotel and airfare).</li><br><li><strong>DashCon.</strong> An internal yearly conference showcasing our engineering culture.</li><br><li><strong>10% time per week</strong> to invest in open source or self-education.</li><br><li><strong>Work from anywhere</strong> in any timezone.</li><br><li><strong>Great benefits</strong>. Health, dental, vision, disability, matching 401k, HSA/FSA, life insurance, and more!</li><br><li>Annual Tuition Reimbursement of up to $2,000</li><br><li><strong>Parties!</strong> We have multiple celebrations every year; join us for summer BBQ and holiday parties.</li><br><li><strong>Good times guarantee</strong>. Board game nights, Bad-joke Wednesdays, our favorite perk ;-)</li><br></ul><br><p><strong>Fun Facts about Our Team</strong></p><br><ul><br><li>Mondays are just Mondays</li><br><li>Tuesdays are Kitten Tuesdays - we post cat pictures in chat</li><br><li>Wednesdays are Bad Joke Wednesdays</li><br><li>Thursdays are Thankful Thursdays where we give shout-outs to our peers</li><br><li>Team coffee run on Fridays (Campbell office), along with Friday pics for sharing resources</li><br><li>Monthly birthday food trucks</li><br></ul><br><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><br><p>RealPage offers an engaging work culture that fosters personal and career growth for our employees—training and development is at our core. RealPage continues reinventing and evolving to meet the needs of the customers we serve through technology and vision. You can feel it in the work we do and the clients that benefit. Our unique company philosophy fosters innovation, excellence and collaboration. Employees are encouraged to take risks and work on projects and products that the market has never seen before.</p><br><p><br>We value personality and fit as much as we value the engineering ability and technical expertise. We want to keep our work environment positive, helpful and collaborative. &nbsp;We are looking for pragmatists, and people who can empathize with users and team members.<br><br>You must demonstrate strong skills in either Rails, Java, or React. While we don’t expect you to know all of the above, you should at least be very proficient at one or more of these. Almost all of our engineers are full-stack, so you must be willing to branch out and master different levels of the technology stack. You will be expected to code with Rails, Java and React. <br><br>A minimum of 2 years of professional development experience is required. &nbsp;You should demonstrate the ability to understand and develop requirements, and produce elegant, extensible object-oriented code (you will be tested on this).<br><br>You should also be familiar with various automated testing principles and techniques. We use RSpec for Ruby and Jest for JavaScript testing.</p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

We work closely with Shopify building polished front-end experiences for our clients, and expanding the native Shopify functionality with bespoke Rails apps that leverage Shopify’s extensive API. We are a core Partner of Shopify, with advance access to upcoming APIs and features, allowing our projects to deliver cutting-edge solutions.</div><div><br></div><div>Our team is small and fully distributed, and working remotely has been part of our DNA since Day 1, meaning you’ll find a great remote working environment focused around making your day-to-day enjoyable and efficient, using tools like Slack for communication, Github for code, Rubymine IDE, Pivotal Tracker for project management, amongst many others. As part of a remote team, we encourage finding a setup that provides both the work productivity and lifestyle that suits everyone, even if that is something completely different for each person. Without geographic constraints, time and location can be flexible to fit around each team member’s needs.</div><div><br></div><div>As our clients are also remote, we occasionally travel to spend time embedded in their offices, and this can also provide us as a team time to come together. Outside of these trips, we also organise an annual meetup to bring everyone together for a few days to get away from our desks, bridge the remote-working gap, and plan for the future direction of the company - our last meetup was in California, fresh off the back of the annual Shopify Unite conference.</div><div><br></div><div>The company has evolved around a few core principles: quality over quantity, under-promise and over-deliver, and taking pride in your work. We take on projects that will present new problems for us to solve, and get excited about elegant solutions to complex problems. Most importantly, we want to invest in our team - we encourage continuous learning and development and aim for a high degree of code-review as part of the day-to-day experience.</div><div><h3>About you</h3></div><div>We are seeking a Junior front-end developer with a keen eye for UI and UX design to help us grow our team.

You will need to be comfortable translating wireframes into a highly intuitive interface, whilst being able to suggest and implement UX improvements in an agile way as you build and receive feedback from the team and stakeholders. Working as part of a remote team has many great advantages, however you will be expected to be able to communicate clearly with the team over a variety of different mediums (including daily video calls, demoing wireframes via Invision, etc), take a task through to completion, and be comfortable with raising issues or questions along the way.</div><div><br></div><div>As a remote team across time zones, we have a flexible approach to work schedule, however we would usually expect you to cross at least 5 hours of 8am - 6pm Monday to Friday GMT+0 during your first year of working with us.</div><div>We favour a CS background over any specific language or technology skills, but as part of this we would expect a foundational understanding in HTML, Javascript, Scss / Sass, the modern web and Git.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Required knowledge and experience</h4></div><ul><li>Familiarity with Javascript, writing semantic markup and using a preprocessor such as Sass, as well as proficiency with Git</li><li>Some experience working with Grunt / Gulp workflows</li><li>Strong verbal and written communication in English</li><li>Exceedingly detail-oriented – for you, a UI build is not complete until it looks pixel perfect</li><li>Naturally organized and self-directed</li></ul><div><h4>Desirable knowledge and experience</h4></div><ul><li>Experience with writing in ES6 syntax and using Webpack</li><li>Experience with the Shopify platform</li><li>Contributions to open-source projects</li><li>Some experience with Ruby on Rails and / or React</li></ul><div><h4>Salaries and Perks</h4></div><ul><li>Starting salary £25k - £32k</li><li>Flexible workspace allowance</li><li>Professional Development allowance</li><li>Team retreats in a different global location each year - Hong Kong for April 2018!</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Pixelcabin is committed to being a culturally diverse team, and we value a broad set of opinions and perspectives.

    "content": "*Full Stack Software Engineer (Go/Javascript/HTML/CSS)*<br /><br />To us, being a Full Stack engineer is a mindset, you need to be competent in your core skills and excited to learn and try new things as and when you see a fit or need.  No one wants to spread themselves too thinly and that is why we have carefully selected our few core technologies but we are not afraid of trying anything new that may be right for the job.  If you agree with this then read on, it should hopefully mean that you are someone that likes to self improve.<br />This role is to be the first tech hire alongside Nub’s founder.  You will be a key hire and valued highly if you can work hard as a team towards the aims of the company.  Your judgement will be valued as we work towards engineering a unique multi-platform application with a web app based UI and a Go based back end.<br /><br />*About you:*<br />- You are a dedicated and resourceful engineer<br />- 2+ years of professional Full Stack Software Engineering Experience<br />- Proven experience of completing HTML/CSS/Javascript deliverables (web app development not brochure style websites)<br />- Competence in Go (Golang) but if you have experience delivering software with another language (such as Python) and are keen to learn Go that may work.<br />- Competence writing SQL<br />- Happy to work with Node.js, Electron, ES6, Babel, Webpack.<br />- Exposure to Vuejs or similar (e.g. react)<br />- You love staying on top of the latest developments in software development <br />- Must be authorized to work in the UK<br />- Happy to work from home but meet in London for regular meetings.<br /><br />*About Nub:*<br />Lego for written comms. Modular utility, ubiquity and unique accessibility.<br /><br />Nub makes sending beautiful and personalised emails, invoices, forms, itineraries, receipts etc as easy as building with lego.  Comprised of an engine and codeless tools to automate data capture, data manipulation and subsequent output primarily via email, pdf, print, data, or api.  Triggered by any system, language or data and achieved without the need to be a programmer.<br /><br />This kit will mean everyone can create cool customer communications on a new, automated, intuitive and scalable platform.  It will allow anyone to handle data transformation and create automated output such as print, pdf or email.  Have control over branding, designs customisation and personalisation.<br /><br />Developers will love this because it removes a complex distraction from their applications. Companies large and small will love this because it will allow custom communications from any system to their employees or clients.<br />Anyone looking to automate data transformation from one format to the other will love this because  they will find it a breeze to achieve.<br /><br />*Why work for us?*<br />Nub is a new startup, the plan is to grow and become something every developer wants to use and every company choses to use...   The CEO has a proven track record in this field and a forensic knowledge of the current technology and a clear vision of its potential. <br /><br />You’ll get to work from home and help define our culture as the company grows.  The plan is for a London office when the time is right.  The CEO has a family, likes coffee, tech, would love a dog, used to race cars and loves sport.<br /><br />You may want to exit the corporate world and enter into an exciting journey with an early stage startup.  You may be bored of coding to someone else's spec, getting stuck in meetings and not being able to be creative with your code.  Work at Nub and that will change.<br />Perhaps you are a brilliant coder looking for a great idea – this is it!",

Our software allows healthcare providers and patients to make better decisions faster.

We also have other large public and private exchange networks, as well as health plan exchanges in active deployment.</p><p>Our team is quite small, but all of us are technical people. We maintain a strong start-up/hacker culture. CareEvolution has partnered with a few large companies with relationships in all 50 states - and beyond - to supply a large portion of our sales and marketing efforts. &nbsp;Our stack is recognized by leading HIE industry analysts as the most technologically sophisticated HIE on the market - by a significant margin. &nbsp;Mention the word sesquipedalian in your employment application to have it processed quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>We are focused and execute very quickly. But we also have a lot of fun - biweekly visits to the bar, daily ping pong/foosball/darts games in the office, hackathons every eight weeks for pet projects, biannual company-wide get-togethers, board game nights, rock climbing nights, disc golf days... etc. We are also a very family-friendly organization. We have constant, active teleconference for all of our remote employees <strong>(all remote people must live somewhere in the US or Canada)</strong> - which comprise more than half of the CareEvolution team.</p><p>Check out our company page to the right,&nbsp;and visit <a title=&quot;http://letsfixhealthcare.com&quot; href='http://letsfixhealthcare.com' rel='nofollow'>http://letsfixhealthcare.com</a> for more information on what we do.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Management-less environment                            </div>                            <div>                                 Work from anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 Competitive Salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 401K &amp; Defined Benefit                            </div>                            <div>                                 Strong Partnerships                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flex Time                            </div>                            <div>                                 Hackathons every 8 weeks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Talented coworkers                            </div>                            <div>                                 Biweekly post-work get-togethers                            </div>                            <div>                                 This work actually matters                            </div>                    ",

introductory phone call and if it sounds like there’s a match we'll arrange for you to meet the team for a full interview. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The interview process lasts several hours and is sometimes split across two days. &nbsp;It is intended to be challenging - but the developers you meet and the topics you’ll be asked to explain (and code!) should give you a very clear sense of what it would be like to work at Selerity. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We value different perspectives and have built a team that reflects that diversity while maintaining the highest standards of excellence. &nbsp;You can rest assured that we welcome talented engineers regardless of their age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity or national

Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.</p><p>We don’t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it’s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it’s all open for anyone to suggest.</p><p><strong>OUR ENGINEERING VALUES</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Move smart</strong>: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).</li><li><strong>Distribute knowledge</strong>: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.</li><li><strong>Leave code better than you found it</strong>: because we constantly raise the bar.</li><li><strong>Unity makes strength</strong>: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.</li><li><strong>Always improve</strong>: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you’ve done.</li></ul><p><strong>MOBILE AT HEETCH</strong></p><p>Our app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for a great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: we are passionate about software architecture. We’ve built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough that we’ll be able to push forward what doing mobile programming means and we’ll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p><ul><li>Build new exciting features.</li><li>Solve challenging real-time synchronization problems.</li><li>Build a robust &amp; modern in-house framework, that will serve our app for next 4 years</li><li>Practise continuous refactoring and unit testing to constantly improve the codebase.</li><li>Create custom UI components (with Playground Driven Development)</li><li>Work on our great shiny redesign of the app.</li><li>Experimenting with various concepts (Coordinators/Flows, ReSwift)</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Great oral and written communication skills.</li><li>Speaking both French and English at a conversational level</li><li>At least 4-5 years of experience with both Objective C and Swift in production environments.</li><li>Experience with creating and supporting a widely used app</li><li>Strong mobile development culture.</li><li>You know how to make integration testing less painful (XCTests, FBSnapshots).</li><li>Strong understanding of the iOS SDK (UIKit, MapKit).</li><li>Ability to thrive in a startup environment.</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS POINTS</strong></p><ul><li>Contributions to open source projects.</li><li>Experience with RxSwift.</li></ul><p><strong>PERKS</strong></p><ul><li>Permanent contract</li><li>Stock.</li><li>Paid conference attendance/travel and periodic team meetups.</li><li>Heetch credits.</li><li>A Spotify subscription.</li><li>Work from anywhere you want.</li></ul>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Full remote (in Europe only) and flexible ways of working                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid conferences attendance/travel                            </div>                            <div>                                 Periodic team meetups                            </div>                            <div>                                 Stocks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Heetch credits                            </div>                    ",

The ability to take lead on projects falling under your responsibility is paramount. While we do not use a strict Agile methodology, you must be comfortable working closely with the rest of the company to ensure an iterative process. We require a basic working proficiency in the written and spoken English language, and the ability to travel to the United States 1-4 times a year for team meet-ups.</p><p>Much as we believe in internet privacy for all, we do not discriminate in who we choose to be part of our team. We know no boundaries based on race, ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexuality, or other terms humans use to separate the 'us' from the 'them'. If you can do the job and communicate readily, we will be happy to work with you.</p><p>We offer a compensation package including paid vacation, holiday, and personal time for all, and US workers enjoy a full benefits package including medical, dental, vision, life, and short and long term disability insurance.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Paid time off and corporate holidays                            </div>                            <div>                                 Full medical, dental, vision                            </div>                            <div>                                 Company provided hardware                            </div>                            <div>                                 Work from anywhere in the world                            </div>                    ",

No, backbone.js is not this week's hottest JS framework, but that's because these apps have been used and enhanced over the last 3 years in production. They've stood the test of time. But we are using the latest tooling alongside - ES6, webpack, less, nightwatch.js etc to make development as clean as possible.</p><p>Are you passionate about efficient client-side performance and robust, scalable platforms? Do you understand the underlying principles of JS (and haven't just built a simple Angular app)? We're adding to our team to build out our Javascript clients for our API-driven microservice retail platform of 18 loosely coupled services. It’s in production, supporting multiple brands and driving millions of dollars of revenue every month from US sales.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with a globally distributed team of 65. We’re proud of the way we get great work done. Our clients love working with us and partner with us on long-term projects.</p><p><strong>What do we offer?</strong></p><ul><li>Work as part of a talented, globally distributed, successful&nbsp;team</li><li>A focussed adherence to our agile/scrum processes (we really believe it helps getting good work done)</li><li>Hard problems to solve (you won't find all the answers on Stack Overflow) - and the opportunity to own the solutions</li><li>A great working atmosphere where you can share and learn with other smart people</li><li>The best-in-class toolsets: Slack, CI/CD with Docker etc</li><li>Meetups in our Barcelona offices for our remote folks</li><li>Competitive rates</li><li>A long term working relationship</li></ul><p><strong>You'll be:</strong></p><ul><li>Building complex Javascript (mainly ES6, webpack) presentation layers to consume RESTful APIs in a performant way.</li><li>Extracting re-usable components to share across multiple SPAs</li><li>Working on ecommerce and back-office direct sales functionality to support hundreds of thousands of customers.</li><li>Helping the backend engineers in designing, specifying and implementing services to decouple functionality</li><li>Occasionally going full stack and diving in the Rails services to add a new endpoint or modify behavior (and we can help you learn here too)</li><li>Working within&nbsp;a fast moving team (working 11am - 8pm Central European time)</li><li>Identifying bottlenecks, using tools to diagnose and refactor code for scale</li><li>Ensuring the robustness, performance and failure characteristics of the system.</li><li>Writing well tested, defect free code with CI/CD</li><li>Taking ownership of production applications - managing issues, releases and ensuring quality</li></ul><p>Good English verbal and written communication skills are essential.

Sure, we can list the latest set of technologies that we use, but that is a given. What's more interesting is how they are used - the design, the architecture, the approach to solving business problems. And we do that across multiple clients - each and every one we're excited to work with.</p><p>Because we believe in constant learning and exploring - whether that’s a new skill, a new role, or a new way of seeing.&nbsp; And because we've found that we learn the most when we take on new challenges as a team.&nbsp; We’re proud that people love working with us (and still have lives outside of work).

Onze klanten zijn o.a. RTL, SBS en Pathé. Momenteel zijn we op zoek naar een Android developer. Nog meer dan skills en ervaring waarderen we je passie voor technologie en in dit geval voor Android in het bijzonder. We horen graag van je waarom je van programmeren en/of Android houdt, waarom jij dit doet en hoe je denkt ons te kunnen helpen met onze Android projecten.</p><p>Wij zijn een remote team wat betekent dat je veelal vanuit huis zult werken. Uiteraard bezoek je regelmatig een klant, en 1 keer in de 2 weken hebben we een gezamelijke 'coworking' day. Ons team bevindt zich voornamelijk in Nederland, we hebben collega's in vrijwel alle provincies.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Egeniq            </h2>            <div><p>Bij Egeniq bouwen we aan apps voor diverse platformen. We doen dat met een team van&nbsp;iets meer dan 20 ontwikkelaars. We houden van technische uitdagingen, onze apps kenmerken zich door een groot aantal users, integraties met diverse backends en vooruitstrevende designs. Op een enkele uitzondering na worden&nbsp;onze apps native ontwikkeld.</p><p>Ondanks dat we remote werken zijn we een hecht team. Naast onze 2-wekelijkse coworking days waarbij we met zijn allen samen komen, zitten we dagelijks op Slack en hebben we dagelijkse (online) standup meetings.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Passionate colleagues                            </div>                            <div>                                 Unlimited vacation days                            </div>                            <div>                                 Freedom                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible work hours                            </div>                            <div>                                 Conference visits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Co-working days                            </div>                            <div>                                 No sales people!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Never stop learning                            </div>                    ",

Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE<span>→</span></a></p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that&nbsp;<strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</p><p><strong>Design Skills We’re Looking For</strong></p><p>This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.</p><p><strong>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) design</li><li>Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles</li><li>Solid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).</li><li>Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.</li><li>History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li></ul><p><strong>Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history</strong>&nbsp;of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.</p><p>We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.</p><p><strong>Some of Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><p><strong>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills.</strong>&nbsp;We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.</p><p><strong>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire.</strong>&nbsp;We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</p><p><strong>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work.</strong>&nbsp;Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.&nbsp;<a href='https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb' rel='nofollow'>Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</a></p><p><strong>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</p><p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p><p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs' rel='nofollow'>READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p><p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p><p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p><p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Ready To Apply?</strong></p><p>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you,&nbsp;<strong>please apply</strong>.</p><p>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?</li><li>How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs? Is there anything you would add or change?</li><li>Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?</li><li>Are you familiar with Holacracy?

We&nbsp;communicate using Slack, frequent video calls, and occasional in-person&nbsp;meet-ups (3-4 times per year). We're proud of both the team we’ve created and what we’ve achieved so far. We’re punching above our weight and are expanding our team to achieve even more.</p><p>We’re still a relatively small team. We’re all good at what we do and enjoy working together. You’ll have autonomy and respect from day one. No regulations or hierarchy, just a lot of interesting and challenging work to get done. You’ll work on our React Native mobile apps, so we’re looking for people who have extensive experience of Javascript and React. If you know React but not React Native, we think you’ll pick it up pretty quickly. Knowledge of Redux, Flow, GraphQL, native modules, C++ is a bonus.</p><p>The most important skill to us is being able to pick up new concepts and technologies rapidly. Ideally, you're the sort of person who has been programming from an early age, thrives on new challenges, is passionate about technology, takes pride in finding elegant solutions to difficult problems, and has a record of open source project involvement.&nbsp;We hope to find individuals full of energy and enthusiasm, with an eye for detail &amp; good design. We’re very open to new ideas, and our most recent joiners have already introduced new tools &amp; techniques&nbsp;to the team.</p><p>Axsy is well-funded&nbsp;and has a great opportunity to grow &amp; succeed. We’re giving you the chance to be part of our success and we offer share options in addition to other benefits.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Axsy            </h2>            <div><p>Axsy&nbsp;is organised as a remote-working team.

Of course you do! Everyone loves wearing pajamas.</p><p>Do you know what's even better than wearing pajamas when sleeping? ... Wearing pajamas when working.</p><p>That's what you can do at Collective2, because we're a remote-work-only, distributed company, and we are hiring.</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p><p>You are a Perl expert with finance and trading experience. Also, you love wearing pajamas to work.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Perl expert. Yeah, no kidding. 90% of what we do server-side is Perl. Still a few of us left, and we refuse to go gently into the night.</li><li>Comfort with client-side Javascript/jQuery.</li><li>Required: deep&nbsp;familiarity with trading, investing,&nbsp;finance.</li><li>Ability to work remotely.</li></ul><p><strong>How to apply - (IMPORTANT)</strong></p><p>Please include&nbsp;a cover letter or note telling us why you are right for this specific position. <strong>Please write&nbsp;about your level of familiarity with trading and finance.</strong> Please look at and use our web site. Do not merely send a&nbsp;CV or resume and call it a day.

Social trading takes the activity of &quot;investing&quot; -- which previously happened only&nbsp;in private, like some kind of embarrassing biological process&nbsp;-- and brings it out into the sunshine so that other people can watch and benefit.</p><p>On Collective2's web site, you can find traders and investors that you like and admire, and follow along with them in your own brokerage account. Alternately, if you're a good trader, you can attract followers (and earn extra money doing so).</p><p>So Collective2's business touches a lot of interesting areas: finance, trading, automation, algorithms, big-data, risk analysis.</p><p><strong>Remote Only</strong></p><p>Collective2 is a &quot;distributed&quot; company - no central office, no cubicles, no pointy-headed managers. We are a team of men and women working together, full-time, from homes and coworking facilities all over the world.</p><p>We are a small company. We try to keep things on a human (and humane) scale. No politics, no corporate B.S.</p><p>Because we are small, every software developer has tremendous responsibility. We'll keep you challenged and happy.</p><p>And finally:</p><p>Be honest with yourself. The idea of working remotely sounds appealing, but it drives some percentage of the population bat-shit crazy. If you need proximity to warm human flesh, a foosball table, or a communal water cooler, this position probably isn't&nbsp;for you. But if you want to live anywhere&nbsp;you like in the world, dream of giving up your commute, and like the idea of working from&nbsp;the quiet and peace of your home, it might be perfect.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Competitive salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 Live anywhere, work anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 No commute!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Independent working environment                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flat structure                            </div>                    ",

As Intelligent Editing’s employee number four, you’ll have a wide set of responsibilities and the opportunity to contribute across as much of the business as interests you. That might include developing the next phase of our website; transforming our software (PerfectIt) to a SaaS model; or developing new products that will amaze anyone who thinks proofreading must be done manually.</p><p>You’ll work with a wide array of technologies (some of which you probably won’t be familiar with when joining). So a desire and ability to learn new tools is essential. We’re looking for a self-starter who will work on both new development and help modernise our existing codebase. You’ll be working directly with the founder &amp; CEO, as well as our Chief Engineer, to develop the tools that will allow the company to grow in the long term.</p><p>From the first day, you’ll be given a lot of responsibility, so you must be able to work and get things done independently. Although the core role is development, you shouldn’t be afraid to pitch in where needed (including admin, sales and support). In return, you’ll become well versed in a full set of skills valuable to any (or your own) startup.</p><p><strong>Duties and Responsibilities</strong></p><p>You will:</p><ul><li>Develop apps for online Office and add-ons for Google Docs</li><li>Contribute to the development of the next version of PerfectIt</li><li>Redesign our internal word usage databases</li><li>Improve our website</li><li>Work on e-commerce</li><li>Put in place unit tests and quality control mechanisms to improve our codebase.</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Intelligent Editing            </h2>            <div><p>Intelligent Editing launched in 2009. We’re not going to be the next Uber, and we don’t want to be. We like being small and profitable with a great team. We believe in steady growth, quality service and producing an excellent product.</p><p>We produce software that works with English-language documents. Our flagship software, PerfectIt, is an add-in for MS Word that finds mistakes that spelling and grammar checkers won’t find, such as consistency errors and style issues. The English language is a beast! And working to automate proofreading tasks for English is one of the most challenging and interesting aspects of our work.</p><p>We’re at the forefront of proofreading/editing technologies. We were among the first companies to produce apps for Office and add-ons for Google Docs, and we have plans to do more development in these environments as the next generation of word processors takes off.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p><strong>Flexible Working</strong></p><p>We have a team call every day between 3pm and 5pm (UK time). All other hours are flexible. If you produce great work, we don’t care when you do it.</p><p><strong>Remote Working</strong></p><p>Candidates should be based in the United Kingdom. Intelligent Editing has no offices, so candidates should be equipped to work from home.</p><p><strong>A Life Beyond Programming</strong></p><p>We believe that it’s impossible for developers to work more than forty hours per week and sustain quality.

We’re Action Verb.</p><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that Engineering and Marketing professionals use to power their products and services.</p><p>Our products include <a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and <a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><p>Our company consists of 8 full time USA-based Engineers, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America. We’re looking to grow our family by one or two faces.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of <a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong> As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about our Holacracy practice.</a></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that <strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about Open Book Management.</a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four quarterly meetings that are hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, and Detroit.</p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. <strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, <strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong> Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully Remote Company!

While these are required as foundational languages, being the first and primary developer for the projects you will be working on, you can enjoy the flexibility of working with any framework. We’re flexible, so even if you primarily work with C# or any other languages, but have experience developing web applications, send us your CV! :)</p><p>Although based in Australia, Avant8 has presence in the US and leverages it to deal with domestic brands and investors, specializing in turning around their distressed digital assets. Our team creates innovative solutions that work well under pressure allowing for new business models to tested rapidly in any market.</p><p>We’re looking for A-players, and part of that involves autonomy. You will be assigned tasks, both small and large, and a general time frame, but given the autonomy and freedom to schedule your own daily tasks as long as you complete what needs to get done. We understand and respect that you know development better than we do and it’s not our place to call unnecessarily strict or irrational deadlines and ways of completing tasks. This may be a good place to add that you should, when applying, mention in the cover letter your favorite food and, if you’re feeling ambitious, include a picture: this is to weed out applicants who mindlessly apply en masse to listings.</p><p>Given the above mentioned autonomy and freedom, you will be expected to debrief with a daily summary of what was accomplished, problems you ran into, what’s planned for the coming days, and maybe a joke or two. :)</p><p>We are a fun, friendly, and closely knit team, and although geographically distant, we have a strong work ethos and communicate regularly allowing for a very friendly and efficient work environment. Being a part of a new division within an established company, you get the best of both worlds in terms of job security and company culture. We work hard and expect the same from all of our team members.</p><p>We work hard, but we also play hard. You should come with a great sense of humor and a smile on your face, because you’ll have a few laughs and enjoy your time working with us. We reward hard work with a variety of perks incorporated in our flexible working environment.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Avant8 Pty Ltd            </h2>            <div><p>We are Australia-based Avant8 Pty Ltd. and we are looking for a motivated full-stack developer to join a new sector in our company that focuses on building digital assets in high trafficked industries, including but not limited to medical (health, wellness), finance, and social.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote working                            </div>                    ",

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developers who want to add to Kibana and X-Pack?

You can see our work at <a href='https://www.omgyes.com' rel='nofollow'>OMGYES.com</a></p><p>We get a huge amount of positive feedback from the press all over the world, and foremost from our users, who tell us how much it has helped their relationships and sex lives. It's been a wonderful, fulfilling journey.</p><p>What we need you to do<br>----------------------------<br>We're always working to keep our busy website (13m req/day) highly available, with minimal latency. We need you to design and implement new features that can scale accordingly. You will be making architectural decisions regarding data storage (database, NoSQL, client-side), content delivery (especially video across a wide range of devices), and gaining user insights through analytics.</p><p>Our users are distributed globally; we need to ensure we can serve a media-rich site in many languages to people all over the world. We need to support purchasing in a range of currencies, using different payment methods, with a careful eye to security.</p><p>Our backend was designed before launch. While it performs quite well, our site has evolved quite a bit since those days. We also have a new season of content that is in production. We've started a new project to build a more appropriate system, starting with season two content, and we want you to work with our front-end team to develop it, using modern best practices.</p><p>Who we're looking for<br>---------------------<br>You are completely at home in a server environment; both in the codebase and in the database. When someone proposes a new site feature, you've already assessed its impact on performance, designed a database schema, and half-architected the solution by the time they finish their pitch. As a full-stack developer, your emphasis is on the backend. You know the ins and outs of OWASP. You believe that design begins with data modeling, and your goal is instant gratification for all consumers of your APIs.</p><p>And, you are a scientist. You measure everything and make that data accessible, so you can make good decisions. You can frame improvements in terms of hypothesis and result, rather than conjecture.</p><p>You have more than 5 years of industry experience.</p><p>Technologies you should know<br>----------------------------<br>(In approximate order of importance, descending, not comprehensive!)</p><p>- MySQL / PostgreSQL<br>- Java (Spring Boot)<br>- Python / Ruby / Node.js (and your favorite web frameworks in each)<br>- Couchbase / Redis<br>- Varnish (and general principles of caching)<br>- AWS S3, EC2, Cloudfront (especially signed URLs)<br>- RESTful API design<br>- Git Flow<br>- Elasticsearch / Kibana / Logstash (self-hosted)<br>- Linux command line<br>- Video content delivery</p><p>Interested?<br>-----------<br>Send us your resume and a few words about why our project in particular interests you.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>(Included in job description)</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About OMGYes            </h2>            <div><p>OMGYes conducts large-scale scientific research into taboo topics like sexual pleasure.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer.

In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects.

We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>If you are local, we do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do.

That said... if you've got a different schedule in mind please apply and let us know what schedule works for you. &nbsp;If you are interested in what you read below please apply and we'll get you started on the process. Thanks ...the Carve team.</p><p><strong>What's the job?</strong></p><ul><li>Information security consulting: assessing the security of software and hardware systems.</li><li>Understanding how systems are built and learning how to break them.</li><li>Working with our experienced team on short-to-medium term engagements.</li></ul><p><strong>What would you do?</strong></p><p>Every two to three weeks you'll get a new project to work on. A typical project will involve:</p><ul><li><strong>Recon</strong>: Digging into the functionality, design, and implementation of the software system or device.</li><li><strong>Probing</strong>: Searching for implementation weaknesses which could indicate a security issue. This is a combination of tools that we use, tools that we build, and manual probing. For device projects this can include firmware extraction, analysis, and hardware interfacing.</li><li><strong>Extending</strong>: Now that you've found a weakness... how far can you extend your access into the system?</li><li><strong>Writing</strong>: Now that you've hacked your way in you'll need to write-up your findings and work with the developers to make sure they understand what the problem is and how to fix it.</li></ul><p>If you enjoy puzzles and technical variety you'll find this job very enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Who are we looking for?</strong></p><ul><li><em>You do not need to have information security experience.</em> If you've got the right technical background and problem solving skills we can train you in the dark arts of infosec.</li><li>People who enjoy writing code, solving problems with code, and learning how computers work at a fundamental level.</li><li>This is not a &quot;travel every week&quot; type of consultant. We do sometimes work at a client site but most of the time we do our projects remotely.</li></ul><p>We’re hiring for all experience levels: from zero career experience to information security veterans.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Deep experience in software and computers. You may have earned this experience with a degree, career as a software developer, or perhaps you've invested in a technical hobby that took you deep into the rabbit hole.</li><li>Technical writing skills (English)</li><li>Resident of the USA and able to be employed in the USA.</li></ul><p>We encourage remote candidates to reply *if* they are residents of the USA.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Carve Systems            </h2>            <div><p>We’re a team of security consultants who do more than hack. We combine engineering and consulting expertise to act as trusted advisors to the world’s largest companies.&nbsp;<br><br>Working at Carve lets you learn from some of the best and brightest in security - and they aren’t just on our team. We believe in engaging with the broader security community to stay on top of our game. You’ll have the opportunity to attend conferences, conduct research, and expand your horizons outside of project-based work. We always enjoy the endorphin rush from finally exploiting &quot;that bug&quot;, but we make a long-term effort to master both technical and consulting skills.<br><br>We are not chained to our computers. We like to stand up and get outside. We trail run, play music, ride bikes, and enjoy well-rounded lives.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision.

A few months ago our recruiting process was going well enough that we had a comment in our HN post from a candidate we'd passed on who was happy enough with the experience that they recommended us in the thread [1]. Last month, however we had the exact opposite experience. Two candidates commented about investing significant effort in the process, only to be ghosted [2].</p><p>I arrived at those comments too late to reply, so I'm using this month's post to apologize. I dug into what happened here and found that we did indeed drop the ball with a few candidates and failed to follow up. Certainly it wasn't our intent and doesn't reflect our values. We've audited the entire candidate pool and have reached out to anyone that fell through the cracks to properly close the loop.  I personally apologize for your poor experiences and the criticism is well deserved.</p><p>I also want to thank the people who commented. I think posting that kind of feedback warning others is an excellent way to keep other members of the community informed, and hold each-other accountable. In this case we've overhauled and streamlined our processes so that we're confident this won't happen again in the future. So thank you for helping us do better, and I'm very sorry that this improvement came at the expense of your time.</p><p>We are hiring, positions are here: <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/elationhealth' rel='nofollow'>https://boards.greenhouse.io/elationhealth</a> and more about what we do at <a href='https://elationhealth.com' rel='nofollow'>https://elationhealth.com</a></p><p>As always, my contact info is in my profile and I'm happy to chat with anyone directly or answer any questions transparently in the comments (I'll monitor those today).</p><p>[1] <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14901945' rel='nofollow'>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14901945</a></p><p>[2] <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15384536' rel='nofollow'>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15384536</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                        </p></div></span></div>",

No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#.

Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.</p><p>We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller.  We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!). Check out our culture map.</p><p>Olo is an equal opportunity employer and diversity is valued at our company. All applicants receive consideration for employment.

Someone who wants to work in a startup environment and likes the idea of doing a bit of everything and taking ownership of what they work on. Someone with ideas about everything, isn’t afraid to argue their point (while respecting everyone else’s of course) and is constantly thinking “How can we do this better?”.<br /><br />Who you are:<br /><br />* You have at least 2 years of commercial experience working as a front-end developer.<br />* You have excellent HTML, CSS (and &quot;plain-old&quot; Javascript) coding skills, with the ability to produce responsive, cross-browser, interactive web pages.<br />* Your interest in development extends past coding; you have a passion for products and a perspective on user experience and product design.<br />* An independent streak is essential – although you will work closely with other members of our team, you will be required at times to drive work forward without being spoon-fed.<br />* Ideally you have already worked within a development team using web frameworks such as Ruby-on-Rails or Elixir-Phoenix, as you will be assisting our back-end development team with the integration of your front-end code with the rest of the application.<br />* **Note:** We are _not currently_ looking for a pure &quot;Javascript Framework&quot; developer (e.g. Angular.js, ReactJS experience is not required), we are looking for a HTML and CSS specialist who can work turn designs and prototypes into working web-pages.  However, any exposure to these technologies would be useful to help with scoping future application requirements.<br /><br />What you’ll do:<br /><br />* Collaborate closely with our UX designers, strategists, CTO and back-end developers, to turn ideas into working features.<br />* Develop our products and services across web, mobile, and other touch devices (HTML web application, native mobile not required)<br />* Work using “Source Control” (i.e. Github) and “Pull Requests” to ensure a high level of quality in your code and an excellent end product for our customers.<br />* Use Agile techniques to iteratively ship products in a small, self-organised team.<br /><br />How to apply:<br /><br />* This position will be based in our Dublin office, but regular visits to our London and Bristol offices will are required. Some remote working may be possible, but we are not looking for fully-remote developers.<br />* If you have done any open-source work, links (e.g. Github projects) would be welcome. However, we recognise that not all companies allow such work, and absence of this will not be counted against your application.<br />* This is a permanent, salaried position. Salary will based on experience.<br />* No recruitment companies please.",

Or a front-end developer who knows Ruby?</p><p>Would you like to envision and develop the web platform for a team of dedicated usability researchers conducting cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc.)?</p><p>Then apply for the following full-time job at Baymard Institute – either working remotely or in Copenhagen, Denmark (or a mix!).</p><h3>About the Job</h3><p>Baymard Institute is a small independent web usability research organization, specialized in conducting large-scale generic usability studies of e-commerce sites. These studies are published as industry reports and benchmark databases at baymard.com (this site is a big part of the web platform you’ll be working on) – which is being used by thousands of web professionals, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.</p><p>In this position you will have a lot of influence on the technical direction of the company since all Baymard employees are e-commerce UX researchers except one (Jamie, co-founder of the business, and the person you’ll be working most closely together with). It’s an opportunity to help envision and build the technical platform of a company that works with tech but doesn’t sell it. (Because of this we’re also more than happy to open-source our internal code and scripts.)</p><p>If you’re looking for a chance to work on long-term goals rather than chasing monthly user growth targets, this will be a good match. We’re a business that has been profitable from day one and we really don’t care about temporarily spiking our user metrics in order to flip the company or impress VC investors. We’re much more interested in steady and sustainable improvements to our business – continually increasing the value we deliver to our customers (from which sustained increases in profitability organically follow). Since all of Baymard’s research is delivered through its website, your work will have an immediate and tangible impact on the company.</p><p>We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which many of our employees do). If you want to, you’re of course also welcome to work in our Copenhagen-based office.</p><p>Salary: in accordance with qualifications.</p><p>Start date: preferably before the end of 2017.</p><h3>Job Requirements</h3><p>You’re skills and interests must span from design to back-end coding. Strong skills in one area can compensate for a weaker side in other areas, but you’ll regularly be working across the spectrum of back-end programming, front-end code, and user interface design, and therefore must have basic skills in all these areas – and even more importantly: enjoy working in all of them!</p><p>Specifically, we’re looking for:</p><ul><li><strong>Back-end skills</strong> – basic programming chops is a requirement for this position, and solid back-end skills is considered a major plus. Familiarity with Ruby is a bonus, but by no means a necessity.</li><li><strong>Front-end skills</strong> – you should be confident in JavaScript and <span>CSS</span>, be able to appreciate concepts such as progressive enhancement, and care deeply about how all of these things tie together and how they impact the end-user experience.</li><li><strong>Design skills</strong> – while we’re definitely not looking for a graphic designer, you must be curious about design and how it shapes users’ perceptions, and enjoy thinking through and tweaking the user interfaces you’re building.</li><li><strong>Interest in UX and e-commerce</strong> is a bonus, but no experience or skills are necessary in this area as you’ll work with (and have the option to be trained by) the best in the business.</li><p></p></ul><p>We furthermore expect you to be fluent in english, comfortable working remotely via digital platforms and willing to do a few yearly travels for team meetups (expect 2-5 weeks of travel each year).</p><h3>Application</h3><p>If you’re interested in this position please send the following (listed in order of importance):</p><ol><li>Samples of back-end code you’ve written.</li><li>Samples of front-end code you’ve written.</li><li>Samples of user interfaces you’ve designed, been involved in designing, or helped implement (please indicate your level of involvement).</li><li>Other information you find relevant (hobbies, interests, work experience, CV, ..).</li></ol><p>Note: open-source contributions are perfectly fine as code samples – simply send along / point us towards whatever “work” you feel best represents your skills.</p><p>Deadline is October 13, 2017. However, we’ll review applications on an ongoing basis, so earlier applicants do have a better chance. All applications and materials are kept strictly confidential.</p><h3>How to apply</h3>",
