The platform is currently in use by over 130 customers, and security operations centers that are 24x7.</p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>We prefer candidates local to the Plano, TX area. We are open to the right candidate even if you are remote. If you are remote and believe you are the right person for the job - send us some code, change our mind!</p><p><strong>The Traits Our Backend Developers Have</strong></p><ol><li>Fluent in Django/Python.</li><li>Passion for front end development. In some cases this is mobile app development, in other cases, it's integration with other products that need to consume our APIs, or web development with AngularJS. This helps build better backends when you are the consumer.</li><li>Possess strongly held beliefs and aren't afraid to voice them. Opinions are usually based on something very specific related either to past experiences or to the platform, and very rarely theoretical.</li><li>At least one specific area of excellence in the skills mentioned below - you know this cold!</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills You'll Need </strong></p><ol><li>Python/Django - We use lots of it.&nbsp;</li><li>Docker, AWS - specifically the following services - ECS, S3, SQS.</li><li>PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana - Core of the platform.</li><li>RabbitMQ, Terraform and other ancillary services that we offer.</li><li>Front End - Pick one: React Native, Angular, Swift, Android.</li></ol><p><strong>The Interview Process </strong></p><ol><li>If you like what you've heard so far and want to come work for us, please send us your resume along with some code samples!</li><li>Give us three (3) days to review and respond. We'll try to respond to everyone who appears to be a good fit.</li><li>A hands-on coding challenge.</li><li>A 60-minute technical conversation about the coding challenge and your resume.</li><li>An in-person interview at our offices.</li><li>A finalized job offer.</li></ol>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Advanced Threat Analytics, Inc.            </h2>            <div><p>Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) is helping MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers) and enterprises finally break free of “alert tyranny” – a state when the volume of security alerts grows so out of control – it dictates staffing levels and operational business models. Traditional SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and incident orchestration solutions try to address the issue by reducing the time it takes to investigate each incident. They do not address the volume issue. ATA takes a different approach – we attack the problem by dramatically slashing the total number of incidents you need to investigate – freeing you from alert overload. This enables you to take a more efficient, effective, and strategic approach to security operations.</p><p><strong>Why Us?</strong></p><ol><li>We are incredibly fast-paced. You must be able to get on board with our pace.</li><li>We turn on a dime - something that sounds like a good idea today, doesn't mean it is - we are fine with that. We like to experiment.</li><li>We are growing at 150% YOY, which means a lot more demands from customers - we like to delight them all!</li><li>Equity and work culture is fantastic! We love what we do and it shows in our work.</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Flexible Hours, Work from anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 401k                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid Holidays, Vacation, and Sick Time                            </div>                            <div>                                 Competitive Salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 Strong Partnerships                            </div>                            <div>                                 Talented coworkers                            </div>                    ",

We're looking for smart software engineers who &quot;get things done&quot;. We’re interested in remote candidates in the USA or candidates interested in working in our Reno office.</p><p>Areas of work include Xamarin iOS/OSX/Android, WPF, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core, Web API, HTML/Javascript, Angular2, Azure, DocumentDB, ANT&nbsp;sport&nbsp;devices, Bluetooth Smart&nbsp;sport&nbsp;devices, Build/Test integration, and SQL among others.</p><p>We're looking to hire&nbsp;three engineers to expand our web team. Inside of that team people usually focus on one of the following areas:</p><p>Backend Development - Controllers, API, Services, Azure data stuff, Integrations, etc</p><p>Frontend Development - Angular2, API, Controllers</p><p>TrainerRoad handles a large amount of data and our site gets a lot of use by a set of passionate users. On the backend, you might enqueue millions of items to process via Azure Functions or WebJobs (quickly and efficiently).&nbsp; On the frontend, you'll be writing code that handles&nbsp;multiple requests per second.</p><p>What I'm saying is your code will matter.</p><p>We've also got a crack design team. They make it so engineers never have to write a single line of CSS!</p><p>Note: We're not on ASP.NET Core yet but we'll move there as soon as EF catches up with our requirements.</p><p><strong>Who&nbsp;We're Looking For</strong></p><p>We want smart engineers! The ideal candidate&nbsp;is a &quot;developer's developer&quot; and enjoys reading about programming in their free time, tinkering on the weekends with side projects and staying abreast of the latest frameworks/technologies in their area of expertise.</p><p>We basically want someone with a passion for development.</p><p><strong>Required Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>C# Experience - Intermediate to Advanced&nbsp;proficiency</li></ul><p><strong>Optional Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>ASP.net MVC</li><li>ASP.net Core</li><li>Javascript Frameworks (Angular2,&nbsp;React,&nbsp;etc)</li><li>LINQ</li><li>Web API</li><li>Azure</li><li>DocumentDB</li><li>SQL</li><li>HTML</li><li>Build/Test CI (We use TeamCity)</li></ul><p><strong>Work Remote or in Reno, Nevada</strong></p><p>We're looking for the best candidate we can find in the US. Over half of our development&nbsp;team works remotely. It works very well with the help of Slack and Github.</p><p>We expect remote employees&nbsp;to overlap at least 6 hours with the Reno, Nevada office (we're there 8am-5pm Pacific time).</p><p><strong>Salary</strong></p><p>We're looking to hire engineers for&nbsp;100k/year. &nbsp;If you ask for more we'll reject your application.

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to actually have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements everything else works itself out.</p><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand totally distraction free for multiple hours.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><p>We have partial test coverage and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each release.</p><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><p>Developers get the super fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><p>If you did follow directions our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><p>If we like you're refactoring we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. &nbsp;Nothing super deep CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Trainer Road, LLC            </h2>            <div><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive Pay</li><li>Unlimited Vacation</li><li>401k with 4% company matching&nbsp;</li><li>99% of employees individual health care paid</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>Access to the latest fitness devices (power meters, trainers, sensors, etc.)</li></ul>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Unlimited Vacation                            </div>                            <div>                                 99% of Employee Health Insurance Paid                            </div>                            <div>                                 Fitness Minded Culture                            </div>                            <div>                                 401k with 4% matching                            </div>                    ",

And here’s what we know to be true:</p><p><strong>Relationships are what make the beauty industry unlike any other.</strong></p><p>When you live it and love it like we do, you help grow it, from the salon’s bottom line to the individual stylist’s paycheck.</p><p>When our industry friends experience wild success, or get up and try again, they share their experiences with us. It’s those stories that built this software.</p><p><strong>That’s why over half of the</strong><em><strong>Salon Today</strong></em><strong>200 salons use SalonBiz.</strong></p><p>Thanks to this group of innovators, our software is a collective intelligence for growth.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Work from Home                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible Working Hours                            </div>                    ",

Then we were acquired and relocated to San Francisco, right in Silicon Valley. We employ creative problem solvers to work in our office and to work remotely from anywhere around the world.</p><p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p><p>There are many problems current IoT devices on the market face that we wish to solve. Using our own blockchain technology helps us achieve this.</p><p>Above all else, we value our customer’s privacy and security because a home is the most intimate place a person can be. We are a hardware company, looking to develop and sell hardware. This means that we don’t collect or store data about our customers. Our devices are designed to operate without storing customer data on our servers.</p><p>We believe that we can succeed without harvesting our customer’s data because our hardware will succeed. Each one of our devices is the result of clever engineering and fine craftsmanship.

    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Senior Ruby on Rails Developer</h2>      <h4>Posted Dec  5</h4>    <h3>      <span>Conferize</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: Copenhagen, Denmark</span><br>        <a href='https://www.conferize.com/jobs/ruby-on-rails-developer' rel='nofollow'>https://www.conferize.com/jobs/ruby-on-rails-developer</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>We are a fast growing startup, building an awesome product. We are looking for backend Ruby on Rails developers to help shape and take part in the process.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About us</b></div><div><br></div><div>Conferize is on a mission to enable anyone to gather a community, share knowledge and create change. So we’re building a universal and social event solution to help event makers create the biggest impact. Without fuss or big budgets. Why? Because we need to meet.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>How We Work</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div></div><div>At Conferize we&nbsp;strive to cultivate a multicultural environment where work, socializing and personal development go hand in hand.&nbsp;<span>We invest in people who are driven and motivated</span><span>&nbsp;and believe in changing the status quo. We love creative thinkers and selfstarters,&nbsp;who&nbsp;never wait to be told what to do.</span></div><div><br></div><div>We believe in a&nbsp;flat bottom-up organization of work where culture trumps policy. We have little-to-no ‘middle layer’, as our&nbsp;team work semi-autonomously and leadership is semi-internalized.&nbsp;We’re 100 % product-driven, operating with a zero bug policy and exceptional product design; how things look, how they work and how they’re built.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Like us you’re ambitious and professional, yet nice to be around. You have excellent standards for how you communicate and collaborate.&nbsp;We’ll give you everything you need to do your absolute best, most creative and challenging work – with the least amount of frustration. Oh, and we never outsource development and we don’t work with arbitrary deadlines, because we believe both&nbsp;lead to bad solutions.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our main office is&nbsp;in Copenhagen&nbsp;and we work with flexible hours.&nbsp;Working&nbsp;remotely is an option if you’re in no more than 1&nbsp;hour from our main time zone (Central European Time).</div><div><br></div><div><span>We believe in fewer great people than many average and invest in people who are self-driven. We have a zero-bug policy and actively try to avoid technical debt.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>General Requirements</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div></div><ul><li>Excellent English communication skills.</li><li>You work on a Mac.</li><li>Have a team mentality.

Our stack is currently a mix of Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>At least 5 years of proven Ruby on Rails experience. Either professional, personal projects or open source.</li><li>Good&nbsp;understanding of both SQL and NoSQL (MongoDB) database fundamentals.</li><li>Good&nbsp;understanding of UNIX and shell scripting. You know your way around Linux.</li><li>Rudimentary frontend experience.

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><p><strong></strong><strong>Who are we?</strong></p><p>BuySellAds operates the largest self-serve advertising marketplace on the web. We’re an adtech company empowering publishers and advertisers to connect more efficiently.</p><p>Don’t let the “adtech” part scare you away: our mission is to help publishers better monetize their sites so they can spend their time focusing on what they care about (their content!) rather than selling ads. We leverage tech to help broker these sales, and attempt to distance ourselves from the shady world of advertising that existed before.</p><p>StackOverflow, CodingHorror.com, NPR, and The Atlantic are just some of the sites who we’re able to help make more money - connecting them with advertisers like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Braintree, and Atlassian who are all able to expand their reach through us.</p><p>We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 30 some-odd people spread out across 30+ cities in 5 countries (please note that right now we are requiring a large overlap with Eastern Time, however). We use PHP, Go, Rails, and React, but seek to hire developers who are language agnostic and are more interested in shipping quality code than bikeshedding it.</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p><p>We’re looking for developers at any level (junior, intermediate, senior) to help us build out our platform. Regardless of level, everyone on our dev team makes meaningful contributions that positively impact our team and our customers every day - you will likely ship code on your very first day at BSA.</p><p>Ideally, we’re looking for someone who is:</p><ul><li>Comfortable across the full stack of the development cycle: frontend, backend, database stuff, as well as following through with testing and shipping.</li><li>A self-starter: remote teams carry lots of autonomy. There’s no micromanaging here.</li><li>A great communicator: we’re big on teaching, learning, debating, and explaining, and these things require clear, deliberate communication.</li><li>Wary of bullet lists with more than 3 items in job postings: we aren’t heavily process-oriented or believe in tons of structure, and if your eyes have glazed over while reading this list, you might just fit right in.</li></ul><p>You’re likely more awesome than you think, so please apply even if you only check a few of these boxes.</p><p><strong>Interested?</strong></p><p>Woohoo! To apply, send us a blurb about who you are and what you’re into to devjob_q4_2017@buysellads.com. If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on what you like to build, things you’ve built in the past that you’re proud of, and what you’d like to be building now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</p><p>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straight-forward: we do an initial meet-and-greet phone screen, a live pair-coding session over Slack (our primary mode of communication), and a take-home coding test. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess. (For reference, in our last hiring round in the summer we responded to 100% of direct applicants and the average response time to an applicant was under 24 hours. The average time from initial contact to us extending an offer was 11 days.)</p><p>And if we are the right fit for each other? Awesome! Come build a platform to help fix advertising with us.</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> 100% remote team, high-impact role on a strong engineering team</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

Whether it’s with customers, employees, or a target market, SurveyMonkey helps curious individuals and companies — including 99% of the Fortune 500 — have conversations at scale with the people who matter most. It’s People Powered Data that allows them to understand not only “what” is happening, but “why.” SurveyMonkey’s 700+ employees throughout North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are dedicated to powering the curious.</p><p><span><strong>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</strong></span></p><p>SurveyMonkey’s platform is used for a myriad of purposes across a broad spectrum of industries. That leaves ample opportunity to build targeted products that solve a specific problem. That’s where our team comes in. We’re responsible for building standalone solutions that address the needs of businesses.</p><p>So far, we’ve built three solutions:</p><ul><li>SurveyMonkey CX - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li>SurveyMonkey Engage - Understand and foster employee engagement</li><li>TechValidate - Publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li></ul><p>We operate each solution as a small startup within the larger SurveyMonkey organization. This affords us flexibility to quickly try new ideas, but with the resources of larger company. Our goal is to build high growth, profitable businesses that leverage the enormous user base of SurveyMonkey.</p><p><span><strong>The Team</strong></span></p><p>Our ten person team is responsible for building products from soup to nuts. We often wear many hats and work across both the technical stack and departments. You’ll have the opportunity to work with people who have successfully launched (and sold) products.</p><p>Most of us choose to focus on one solution at a time. We feel this allows us to fully embrace and understand our customer needs and develop a deep technical understanding of the problem domain. However, we are also committed to sharing our work - not just with each other, but via open source contributions to our code library, Pano.</p><p><span><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></span></p><p>We are looking for an experienced front-end engineer who has worked on Ruby on Rails applications. You should be a CSS expert and appreciate the clarity of Haml and Sass. Interest beyond the view layer is always welcome - either delving into controllers or models, or bringing an eye for design. Experience with HTML emails will also come in handy.</p><p>You should be fluent in Javascript. While we are skeptical of Javascript frameworks, we embrace ES6. Knowledge of D3 is a plus. Understanding of Turbolinks will serve you well.</p><p>Overall, you’ll need a strong command of web standards and cross-browser compatibility. You should be able to demonstrate relevant past experience working on complex web applications.</p><p><span><strong>Why Work Here?</strong></span></p><p>We are a remote team.

How about branching out to VR and AR? Do you like to work in a fast-paced environment with a fantastic product team? Do you feel like your current job is just a job and you have to fight for flexible hours, ability to work from home, and your innovation time is reduced to an occasional hackathon? Are you tired of various business stakeholders treating you like a waiter in a fast-food restaurant? If the answer is yes, then read on and hit that 'Apply Now' button, because we are different!<br /><br />At Concrete we work hard to create a perfect environment for our engineers. We don't have a Michelin star chef to serve your lunch but we do have an established working from home policy so you can spend more time with your family. We also don't have a barista on-site to serve your almond milk latte, but we are flexible - you can start your day in the office at any time providing you make it for our daily standup (because it is important! and yes, we do have a very good coffee machine).<br /><br />This time we are looking for a Senior Fullstack engineer to take ownership and guide our multi-skilled development team. You will be working alongside management and the backend lead to deliver applications for a new retail platform using the very latest JavaScript technologies and Frameworks.<br /><br />We are constantly building new applications for our clients - Marks and Spencer, GAP and many more. Working on a real-time collaboration software is challenging - you will have to learn new technologies and prototype new apps at a speed of light, but not because it is a high-pressure environment, simply because you like to see your code working in production. That said, we don't tolerate sloppy coding - for every single line of code we write, there is almost always a line of unit-testing code.<br /><br />If you're a frontend lead right now or a driven senior engineer with a burning desire for a career progression and a skillset to match - get in touch!<br /><br />Skills &amp; Requirements<br /><br />Must have<br />* Strong experience developing web apps and mobile-first websites<br />* 5+ years experience in development using modern stacks / frameworks / technologies<br />* An expert understanding of Javascript (ES6) <br />* Experience with OO and MVC design patterns<br />* Understanding of functional programming<br />* Solid experience with React/Redux/Redux-saga<br />* Solid experience with Node.js<br />* Knowledge of when and how to apply design patterns<br />* Good grasp of functional programming and SOLID principles<br />* TDD/Unit testing<br />* Clean code is your second nature<br />* Experience with testing frameworks such as jest, mocha, chai etc...<br />* Experience developing SaaS products<br />* Previous experience of managing, mentoring and coaching teams of engineers<br />* Worked previously in an international environment<br />* Links to existing work or projects on Git<br />* Experience with AWS<br /><br />Nice to have<br />* Other programming languages (Go, Rust)<br />* Experience designing APIs from scratch<br />* Kubernetes/Docker<br />* Exposure to event-sourcing architecture<br />* Experience with CQRS",

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to actually have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><br><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><br><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><br><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><br><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><br><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><br><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><br><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><br><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><br><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><br><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><br><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><br><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><br><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements everything else works itself out.</p><br><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><br><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><br><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand totally distraction free for multiple hours.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><br><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><br><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><br><p>We have partial test coverage and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><br><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each release.</p><br><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><br><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><br><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><br><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><br><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><br><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><br><p>Developers get the super fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><br><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><br><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><br><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><br><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><br><p>If you did follow directions our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><br><p>If we like you're refactoring we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. &nbsp;Nothing super deep CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><br><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><br><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><br><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><br><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><br><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><br><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><br><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><br><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><br><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.</p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

Do you also enjoy engineering management books, and believe in  the value of engineering apprenticeship, which can allow junior engineers to level up in their career? If so, you might enjoy being a Senior Software Engineer at Parse.ly.</p><p>First, let’s answer a key question: what’s Parse.ly? Well, Parse.ly is a real-time content measurement layer for the entire web. Our analytics platform helps digital storytellers at some of the web's best sites, such as Arstechnica, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch, The Intercept, Mashable, and many more. In total, our analytics system handles over 65 billion monthly events from over 1 billion monthly unique visitors.</p><p>Our entire stack is in Python and JavaScript, and our team has innovated in areas related to real-time analytics, building some of the best open source tools for working with modern stream processing technologies.</p><p>On the open source front, we maintain <a href='https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse' rel='nofollow'>streamparse</a>, the most widely used Python binding for the Apache Storm streaming data system. We also maintain <a href='https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka' rel='nofollow'>pykafka</a>, the most performant and Pythonic binding for Apache Kafka.</p><p>Our colleagues are talented: our UX/design team has also built one of the best-looking dashboards on the planet, using AngularJS and D3.js, and our infrastructure engineers have built a scalable devops-friendly cloud environment.</p><p>As a Senior Software Engineer, you would master our backend stack -- or,  fill in whatever gaps you might be missing if you already know some of our technologies. But you’d also spend a portion of your time defining a roadmap for our “Customer Success Engineering” group, which is a group of bright engineers, more junior in their career, who are focusing on customer-facing and customer-deployed data integration challenges. It’s an ideal opportunity to put your programming skills to use, while also flexing some engineering and project management skills, to boot.</p><h4>Responsibilities</h4><p>Parse.ly’s data engineering team already makes use of modern technologies like Python, Storm, Spark, Kafka, and Elasticsearch to analyze large datasets. As a Software Engineer at Parse.ly, you will be expected to master these technologies, while also being able to write code against them in Python, and debug issues down to the native C code and native JVM code layers, as necessary.</p><p>However, your focus will be on deep understanding, commensurate with your technical background. Our product is widely used by over 250 enterprises with over 30,000 active seats, each of whom is viewing our data on a regular basis, and we have a team of engineers who help assist these customers with understanding their data, debugging data integration problems, and investigating code and data discrepancies. You would lead this team with its own focused roadmap of how to apply programming skills to solve customer problems.</p><p>Examples of past projects this team has built:</p><ul><li>A page data debugging tool, using web crawling</li><li>An automated system for re-processing customer data to correct historical errors</li><li>A public API explorer tool, for understanding how to use our HTTP/JSON API</li><li>An admin panel for tracking customer usage, pricing tiers, and invites</li><li>An Amazon Redshift based data warehouse for doing product usage analytics</li></ul><p>If you get excited by the idea of specifying and clarifying requirements around “quick-win” engineering projects that have a huge impact on the business and on how our customers interact with our support team, this is an ideal role for you.</p><h4>What you'll do</h4><p>For this role, you should already be a proficient programmer who wants to work with data at scale. You should already have, or be willing to gain, a full level of Python expertise.</p><p>In the role, you’ll...</p><ul><li>Write Python code using the best practices. See <a href='https://github.com/amontalenti/elements-of-python-style' rel='nofollow'>The Elements of Python Style</a>, written by our CTO, for an example of our approach to code readability and design.</li><li>Analyze data at massive scale. You need to be comfortable with the idea of your code running across 3,000 Python cores, thanks to process-level parallelization.</li><li>Brainstorm new ideas for how automation can solve problems for our customer success team. You need to be a good communicator, especially in written form.</li><li>Own a product roadmap for &quot;Customer Success Engineering&quot;, with a team of at least 5 junior engineers who would execute that roadmap.</li><li>Directly mentor these 5 engineers as they gain new skills in programming, web development, and data analysis.</li><li>Master cloud technologies and systems. You should love UNIX and be able to reason about distributed systems.</li></ul><h4>Benefits</h4><p>Our distributed team is best-in-class and we happily skip commutes by working out of our ergonomic home offices. Here's <a href='https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73' rel='nofollow'>a photograph of our CTO's setup running two full-screen Parse.ly dashboards</a>.</p><ul><li>Work from home or anywhere else in our industry-leading distributed team.</li><li>Earn a competitive salary and benefits (health/dental/401k).</li><li>Splurge with a generous equipment budget.</li><li>Work with one of the brightest teams in tech.</li><li>Speak at and attend conferences like PyData on Parse.ly's dime.</li></ul><h4>Parse.ly Tech</h4><ul><li>Python for both backend and frontend -- 2.7, some systems in 3.x, and we're going full-on 3.x soon.</li><li>Amazon Web Services used for most systems.</li><li>Modern databases like Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Redis, and Postgres.</li><li>Frameworks like Django, Tornado and the PyData stack (e.g. Pandas).</li><li>Running Kafka, Storm, Spark in production atop massive data sets.</li><li>Easy system management with Fabric and Chef.</li></ul><h4>Fully distributed team</h4><p>Parse.ly is a fully distributed team, with engineers working from across the world. People with past experience working remotely will be prioritized. US/Eastern timezones will be prioritized.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United States</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>EST or CST (or nearby)</p></dd>        </dl>",

As the market leader for field service supply chain solutions in the UK, we rely on our software team to innovate and build new solutions, as well as developing our existing systems, keeping ByBox ahead of the competition and reinforcing our position as a successful innovator within UK field support.</p><p>We are also successfully re-positioning ourselves as a global technology provider for locker delivery solutions, predominantly focussing on the field service supply chain. This is an exciting departure from the previous market position as a distribution company with a strong technology capability. This change of position is allowing us to operate a different revenue model, through software subscriptions and licensing, rather than through logistics services.</p><p>To support this, the software development department must deliver the correct short and long-term projects to enable that re-positioning.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>As a Software Development Manager at ByBox your duties include:</p><p>Leadership. Lead, motivate and influence a team of expert software developers to deliver value for ByBox while ensuring software quality. Ensure the developers have all the tools they need, be it hardware, software, or training, to do their job to the required level.</p><p>Relationships. Work closely with colleagues in the software development department to ensure the development team are aligned to business priorities and strategy. Develop strong relationships with internal customers to understand their perspectives and to positively influence the reputation of software development.</p><p>Recruitment. Take a highly pro-active role in the recruitment of software developers. Work with the ByBox recruitment team to ensure the highest-quality candidates are identified and engaged effectively. Also, engage with external organisations to seek the right talent and to promote ByBox as a forward-thinking employer of software developers.</p><p>Resourcing. Work closely with the Business Interface Manager and Project Managers to ensure the right developers are available at the right time for delivering the Software Development Pipeline. Where necessary, own the relationship with outsourced-development teams and the process for bringing on additional software developers on a temporary-contract basis. Ensure the software developers are appropriately assigned to projects, and given opportunities to work on other projects as required and fairly. Respond to business needs through the appropriate deployment of developers, while protecting long-term contingency in capacity so we can quickly respond to opportunities.</p><p>People development. Develop and retain our people by fostering a positive environment for personal and professional development through continuously engaging with developers, appraisals, objectives and training plans. Provide a platform for developers to raise concerns or offer new ideas, support one another, and resolve conflict, and where necessary manage performance or disciplinary concerns. Promote and develop the key values from our Ways of Working, including innovation, trust and openness.</p><p>Continuous improvement. Drive continuous improvement and adoption of best practices within the software development team to optimize the performance of the team. By pragmatically weighing the business need for delivery with the need to keeping technology current, help to ensure the team is producing the right solution at the right time.</p><p>Documentation. Define and own the good practice for technical documentation, demos, and handovers amongst the team for the benefit of colleagues, and customers requiring technical API documentation.</p><p>Technology. Support your team in ensuring they are abreast of the latest developments in technologies, and they have the tools they need to adopt appropriate technology. Be familiar with the current technologies in your team, and be aware of upcoming technologies. You do not need to be the technology expert within your team, but must be able to articulate the pros and cons of competing technologies and justify investment to senior management.</p><p>Quality Assurance. Work very closely with the Quality Assurance Manager to ensure QA practices are aligned across the department, particularly in the adoption of Test Automation and the Test Automation Engineers reporting to the QA Manager.</p><p>Workload. Manage your own objectives and priorities effectively and without close supervision. Although you won't be directly managing the work of your direct reports (this will be done by Software Project Managers), a good awareness of their current work will be crucial in making good decisions. You will be able to escalate issues to the Head of R&amp;D and will also be required to make recommendations. You will also be involved in the technology strategy by supporting the Head of R&amp;D with departmental planning activities as required.</p><p><strong>The Person</strong></p><p>The Software Development manager does not need to be currently active in writing code, and the role does not entail any code-writing, but there is room for a successful candidate to define the level of their technical involvement, based on their knowledge. The ideal candidate will:</p><ul><li>Have a passion for Technology and good understanding of trends in Software Development.</li><li>Have a strong technical foundation in Software Development.</li><li>Embrace a cross-functional approach to team management and appreciate the challenges therein.</li><li>Foster an open, collaborative environment, and balance people's needs with company objectives.</li><li>Appreciate the challenges of managing a team of home-workers, and home-working yourself.</li><li>Understand how to lead and manage a team of highly talented, distributed Software Developers.</li></ul><p><strong>Essential qualifications and experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Team Leadership or Management, particularly teams of Software Developers</li><li>Technical background.</li><li>Worked with home-working or distributed teams.</li><li>Management of outsourced development partners.</li><li>Excellent command of written and spoken English.</li></ul><p><strong>Desirable qualifications and experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience working in a team of primarily .Net &amp; JavaScript developers.</li><li>Experience in the logistics industry.</li><li>Knowledge of the ByBox domain</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About ByBox            </h2>            <div><p>ByBox is leading the way in box-based logistics.

Here is some of what you can expect working here:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>. Developers are organized into autonomous teams of 2-4 developers and have a lot of control over how they collaborate, communicate, and work in general.</li><br><li><strong>Agility</strong>. Teams practice scrum, work in sprints, calculate velocity, do code reviews and rely on Continuous Integration.</li><br><li><strong>Location Independence</strong>. Remote work is built into our company’s DNA. Half of our developers are remote!</li><br><li><strong>Craftsmanship</strong>. We have excellent engineers spanning all skill levels, and we are all committed to becoming better at our craft. We practice Lunch &amp; Learns,mentorship, and pair programming.</li><br><li><strong>Stewardship</strong>. We are big proponents of open source, use it a lot, and give back to the community wherever we can.</li><br></ul><br><p>Our 17 year old codebase is constantly evolving to incorporate modern technologies. We started with Java, moved into JRuby on Rails leveraging the Java code with JRuby, and are now incorporating React where it makes sense. We use RSpec for testing Ruby and Java, and Jest for JavaScript.</p><br><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><br><p>We care about our people, and as such are strong believers in having fun at work, continuing education and work/life/family balance. We demonstrate that in the followings ways:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong><strong>Competitive Pay</strong>. We hire excellent people and reward them accordingly.</strong></li><br><li><strong>One Paid Conference</strong> per year (including hotel and airfare).</li><br><li><strong>DashCon.</strong> An internal yearly conference showcasing our engineering culture.</li><br><li><strong>10% time per week</strong> to invest in open source or self-education.</li><br><li><strong>Work from anywhere</strong> in any timezone.</li><br><li><strong>Great benefits</strong>. Health, dental, vision, disability, matching 401k, HSA/FSA, life insurance, and more!</li><br><li>Annual Tuition Reimbursement of up to $2,000</li><br><li><strong>Parties!</strong> We have multiple celebrations every year; join us for summer BBQ and holiday parties.</li><br><li><strong>Good times guarantee</strong>. Board game nights, Bad-joke Wednesdays, our favorite perk ;-)</li><br></ul><br><p><strong>Fun Facts about Our Team</strong></p><br><ul><br><li>Mondays are just Mondays</li><br><li>Tuesdays are Kitten Tuesdays - we post cat pictures in chat</li><br><li>Wednesdays are Bad Joke Wednesdays</li><br><li>Thursdays are Thankful Thursdays where we give shout-outs to our peers</li><br><li>Team coffee run on Fridays (Campbell office), along with Friday pics for sharing resources</li><br><li>Monthly birthday food trucks</li><br></ul><br><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><br><p>RealPage offers an engaging work culture that fosters personal and career growth for our employees—training and development is at our core. RealPage continues reinventing and evolving to meet the needs of the customers we serve through technology and vision. You can feel it in the work we do and the clients that benefit. Our unique company philosophy fosters innovation, excellence and collaboration. Employees are encouraged to take risks and work on projects and products that the market has never seen before.</p><br><p><br>We value personality and fit as much as we value the engineering ability and technical expertise. We want to keep our work environment positive, helpful and collaborative. &nbsp;We are looking for pragmatists, and people who can empathize with users and team members.<br><br>You must demonstrate strong skills in either Rails, Java, or React. While we don’t expect you to know all of the above, you should at least be very proficient at one or more of these. Almost all of our engineers are full-stack, so you must be willing to branch out and master different levels of the technology stack. You will be expected to code with Rails, Java and React. <br><br>A minimum of 2 years of professional development experience is required. &nbsp;You should demonstrate the ability to understand and develop requirements, and produce elegant, extensible object-oriented code (you will be tested on this).<br><br>You should also be familiar with various automated testing principles and techniques. We use RSpec for Ruby and Jest for JavaScript testing.</p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

You’ll be an integral part of our product and engineering teams focused on architecting and developing our client-side programming.</p><p>We’re looking for a strong track record of architecting and building products. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>*What You'll Do*<br>* Lead development on the client layer and user experience.<br>* Develop a comprehensive HTML/CSS/JS framework for rendering web applications for multiple devices and themes.<br>* Refine the application building experience that makes it a delight for our customers to use and extend Knack.<br>* Consistently improve the speed, reliability, and performance of the Knack client application.<br>* Evaluate new technologies and help determine opportunities to leverage these.<br>* Work on implementing front-end Knack features.</p><p>How you’ll do this:<br>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our small engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*About You*<br>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You’re an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You’re not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers.</p><p>You have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.</p><p>*About Knack*<br>Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.</p><p>Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>So why are we different?</p><p>We’re bootstrapped: we’ve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things.</p><p>We’re 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.</p><p>We’re small: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars-- we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.</p><p>We enjoy the journey: we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*<br>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You’ll get forced days off for birthdays and knackiversaries.</p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p><p>Please note that we are only considering applicants legally eligible to work in the US.</p></div>",

We work closely with Shopify building polished front-end experiences for our clients, and expanding the native Shopify functionality with bespoke Rails apps that leverage Shopify’s extensive API. We are a core Partner of Shopify, with advance access to upcoming APIs and features, allowing our projects to deliver cutting-edge solutions.</div><div><br></div><div>Our team is small and fully distributed, and working remotely has been part of our DNA since Day 1, meaning you’ll find a great remote working environment focused around making your day-to-day enjoyable and efficient, using tools like Slack for communication, Github for code, Rubymine IDE, Pivotal Tracker for project management, amongst many others.

    "content": "*Full Stack Software Engineer (Go/Javascript/HTML/CSS)*<br /><br />To us, being a Full Stack engineer is a mindset, you need to be competent in your core skills and excited to learn and try new things as and when you see a fit or need.  No one wants to spread themselves too thinly and that is why we have carefully selected our few core technologies but we are not afraid of trying anything new that may be right for the job.  If you agree with this then read on, it should hopefully mean that you are someone that likes to self improve.<br />This role is to be the first tech hire alongside Nub’s founder.  You will be a key hire and valued highly if you can work hard as a team towards the aims of the company.  Your judgement will be valued as we work towards engineering a unique multi-platform application with a web app based UI and a Go based back end.<br /><br />*About you:*<br />- You are a dedicated and resourceful engineer<br />- 2+ years of professional Full Stack Software Engineering Experience<br />- Proven experience of completing HTML/CSS/Javascript deliverables (web app development not brochure style websites)<br />- Competence in Go (Golang) but if you have experience delivering software with another language (such as Python) and are keen to learn Go that may work.<br />- Competence writing SQL<br />- Happy to work with Node.js, Electron, ES6, Babel, Webpack.<br />- Exposure to Vuejs or similar (e.g. react)<br />- You love staying on top of the latest developments in software development <br />- Must be authorized to work in the UK<br />- Happy to work from home but meet in London for regular meetings.<br /><br />*About Nub:*<br />Lego for written comms. Modular utility, ubiquity and unique accessibility.<br /><br />Nub makes sending beautiful and personalised emails, invoices, forms, itineraries, receipts etc as easy as building with lego.  Comprised of an engine and codeless tools to automate data capture, data manipulation and subsequent output primarily via email, pdf, print, data, or api.  Triggered by any system, language or data and achieved without the need to be a programmer.<br /><br />This kit will mean everyone can create cool customer communications on a new, automated, intuitive and scalable platform.  It will allow anyone to handle data transformation and create automated output such as print, pdf or email.  Have control over branding, designs customisation and personalisation.<br /><br />Developers will love this because it removes a complex distraction from their applications. Companies large and small will love this because it will allow custom communications from any system to their employees or clients.<br />Anyone looking to automate data transformation from one format to the other will love this because  they will find it a breeze to achieve.<br /><br />*Why work for us?*<br />Nub is a new startup, the plan is to grow and become something every developer wants to use and every company choses to use...   The CEO has a proven track record in this field and a forensic knowledge of the current technology and a clear vision of its potential. <br /><br />You’ll get to work from home and help define our culture as the company grows.  The plan is for a London office when the time is right.  The CEO has a family, likes coffee, tech, would love a dog, used to race cars and loves sport.<br /><br />You may want to exit the corporate world and enter into an exciting journey with an early stage startup.  You may be bored of coding to someone else's spec, getting stuck in meetings and not being able to be creative with your code.  Work at Nub and that will change.<br />Perhaps you are a brilliant coder looking for a great idea – this is it!",

No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic.

Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D.

Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.</p><p>We don’t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it’s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it’s all open for anyone to suggest.</p><p><strong>OUR ENGINEERING VALUES</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Move smart</strong>: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).</li><li><strong>Distribute knowledge</strong>: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.</li><li><strong>Leave code better than you found it</strong>: because we constantly raise the bar.</li><li><strong>Unity makes strength</strong>: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.</li><li><strong>Always improve</strong>: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you’ve done.</li></ul><p><strong>MOBILE AT HEETCH</strong></p><p>Our app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for a great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: we are passionate about software architecture. We’ve built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough that we’ll be able to push forward what doing mobile programming means and we’ll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p><ul><li>Build new exciting features.</li><li>Solve challenging real-time synchronization problems.</li><li>Build a robust &amp; modern in-house framework, that will serve our app for next 4 years</li><li>Practise continuous refactoring and unit testing to constantly improve the codebase.</li><li>Create custom UI components (with Playground Driven Development)</li><li>Work on our great shiny redesign of the app.</li><li>Experimenting with various concepts (Coordinators/Flows, ReSwift)</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Great oral and written communication skills.</li><li>Speaking both French and English at a conversational level</li><li>At least 4-5 years of experience with both Objective C and Swift in production environments.</li><li>Experience with creating and supporting a widely used app</li><li>Strong mobile development culture.</li><li>You know how to make integration testing less painful (XCTests, FBSnapshots).</li><li>Strong understanding of the iOS SDK (UIKit, MapKit).</li><li>Ability to thrive in a startup environment.</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS POINTS</strong></p><ul><li>Contributions to open source projects.</li><li>Experience with RxSwift.</li></ul><p><strong>PERKS</strong></p><ul><li>Permanent contract</li><li>Stock.</li><li>Paid conference attendance/travel and periodic team meetups.</li><li>Heetch credits.</li><li>A Spotify subscription.</li><li>Work from anywhere you want.</li></ul>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Full remote (in Europe only) and flexible ways of working                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid conferences attendance/travel                            </div>                            <div>                                 Periodic team meetups                            </div>                            <div>                                 Stocks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Heetch credits                            </div>                    ",

The ability to take lead on projects falling under your responsibility is paramount. While we do not use a strict Agile methodology, you must be comfortable working closely with the rest of the company to ensure an iterative process. We require a basic working proficiency in the written and spoken English language, and the ability to travel to the United States 1-4 times a year for team meet-ups.</p><p>Much as we believe in internet privacy for all, we do not discriminate in who we choose to be part of our team.

No, backbone.js is not this week's hottest JS framework, but that's because these apps have been used and enhanced over the last 3 years in production. They've stood the test of time. But we are using the latest tooling alongside - ES6, webpack, less, nightwatch.js etc to make development as clean as possible.</p><p>Are you passionate about efficient client-side performance and robust, scalable platforms? Do you understand the underlying principles of JS (and haven't just built a simple Angular app)? We're adding to our team to build out our Javascript clients for our API-driven microservice retail platform of 18 loosely coupled services. It’s in production, supporting multiple brands and driving millions of dollars of revenue every month from US sales.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with a globally distributed team of 65. We’re proud of the way we get great work done. Our clients love working with us and partner with us on long-term projects.</p><p><strong>What do we offer?</strong></p><ul><li>Work as part of a talented, globally distributed, successful&nbsp;team</li><li>A focussed adherence to our agile/scrum processes (we really believe it helps getting good work done)</li><li>Hard problems to solve (you won't find all the answers on Stack Overflow) - and the opportunity to own the solutions</li><li>A great working atmosphere where you can share and learn with other smart people</li><li>The best-in-class toolsets: Slack, CI/CD with Docker etc</li><li>Meetups in our Barcelona offices for our remote folks</li><li>Competitive rates</li><li>A long term working relationship</li></ul><p><strong>You'll be:</strong></p><ul><li>Building complex Javascript (mainly ES6, webpack) presentation layers to consume RESTful APIs in a performant way.</li><li>Extracting re-usable components to share across multiple SPAs</li><li>Working on ecommerce and back-office direct sales functionality to support hundreds of thousands of customers.</li><li>Helping the backend engineers in designing, specifying and implementing services to decouple functionality</li><li>Occasionally going full stack and diving in the Rails services to add a new endpoint or modify behavior (and we can help you learn here too)</li><li>Working within&nbsp;a fast moving team (working 11am - 8pm Central European time)</li><li>Identifying bottlenecks, using tools to diagnose and refactor code for scale</li><li>Ensuring the robustness, performance and failure characteristics of the system.</li><li>Writing well tested, defect free code with CI/CD</li><li>Taking ownership of production applications - managing issues, releases and ensuring quality</li></ul><p>Good English verbal and written communication skills are essential.

Sure, we can list the latest set of technologies that we use, but that is a given. What's more interesting is how they are used - the design, the architecture, the approach to solving business problems. And we do that across multiple clients - each and every one we're excited to work with.</p><p>Because we believe in constant learning and exploring - whether that’s a new skill, a new role, or a new way of seeing.&nbsp; And because we've found that we learn the most when we take on new challenges as a team.&nbsp; We’re proud that people love working with us (and still have lives outside of work).

Onze klanten zijn o.a. RTL, SBS en Pathé. Momenteel zijn we op zoek naar een Android developer. Nog meer dan skills en ervaring waarderen we je passie voor technologie en in dit geval voor Android in het bijzonder. We horen graag van je waarom je van programmeren en/of Android houdt, waarom jij dit doet en hoe je denkt ons te kunnen helpen met onze Android projecten.</p><p>Wij zijn een remote team wat betekent dat je veelal vanuit huis zult werken. Uiteraard bezoek je regelmatig een klant, en 1 keer in de 2 weken hebben we een gezamelijke 'coworking' day. Ons team bevindt zich voornamelijk in Nederland, we hebben collega's in vrijwel alle provincies.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Egeniq            </h2>            <div><p>Bij Egeniq bouwen we aan apps voor diverse platformen. We doen dat met een team van&nbsp;iets meer dan 20 ontwikkelaars. We houden van technische uitdagingen, onze apps kenmerken zich door een groot aantal users, integraties met diverse backends en vooruitstrevende designs. Op een enkele uitzondering na worden&nbsp;onze apps native ontwikkeld.</p><p>Ondanks dat we remote werken zijn we een hecht team. Naast onze 2-wekelijkse coworking days waarbij we met zijn allen samen komen, zitten we dagelijks op Slack en hebben we dagelijkse (online) standup meetings.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Passionate colleagues                            </div>                            <div>                                 Unlimited vacation days                            </div>                            <div>                                 Freedom                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible work hours                            </div>                            <div>                                 Conference visits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Co-working days                            </div>                            <div>                                 No sales people!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Never stop learning                            </div>                    ",

Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE<span>→</span></a></p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that&nbsp;<strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</p><p><strong>Design Skills We’re Looking For</strong></p><p>This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.</p><p><strong>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) design</li><li>Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles</li><li>Solid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).</li><li>Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.</li><li>History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li></ul><p><strong>Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history</strong>&nbsp;of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.</p><p>We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.</p><p><strong>Some of Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><p><strong>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills.</strong>&nbsp;We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.</p><p><strong>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire.</strong>&nbsp;We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</p><p><strong>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work.</strong>&nbsp;Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.&nbsp;<a href='https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb' rel='nofollow'>Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</a></p><p><strong>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</p><p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p><p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs' rel='nofollow'>READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p><p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p><p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p><p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Ready To Apply?</strong></p><p>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you,&nbsp;<strong>please apply</strong>.</p><p>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?</li><li>How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs? Is there anything you would add or change?</li><li>Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?</li><li>Are you familiar with Holacracy?

We&nbsp;communicate using Slack, frequent video calls, and occasional in-person&nbsp;meet-ups (3-4 times per year). We're proud of both the team we’ve created and what we’ve achieved so far. We’re punching above our weight and are expanding our team to achieve even more.</p><p>We’re still a relatively small team. We’re all good at what we do and enjoy working together. You’ll have autonomy and respect from day one. No regulations or hierarchy, just a lot of interesting and challenging work to get done. You’ll work on our React Native mobile apps, so we’re looking for people who have extensive experience of Javascript and React. If you know React but not React Native, we think you’ll pick it up pretty quickly. Knowledge of Redux, Flow, GraphQL, native modules, C++ is a bonus.</p><p>The most important skill to us is being able to pick up new concepts and technologies rapidly. Ideally, you're the sort of person who has been programming from an early age, thrives on new challenges, is passionate about technology, takes pride in finding elegant solutions to difficult problems, and has a record of open source project involvement.&nbsp;We hope to find individuals full of energy and enthusiasm, with an eye for detail &amp; good design. We’re very open to new ideas, and our most recent joiners have already introduced new tools &amp; techniques&nbsp;to the team.</p><p>Axsy is well-funded&nbsp;and has a great opportunity to grow &amp; succeed. We’re giving you the chance to be part of our success and we offer share options in addition to other benefits.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Axsy            </h2>            <div><p>Axsy&nbsp;is organised as a remote-working team.

Of course you do! Everyone loves wearing pajamas.</p><p>Do you know what's even better than wearing pajamas when sleeping? ... Wearing pajamas when working.</p><p>That's what you can do at Collective2, because we're a remote-work-only, distributed company, and we are hiring.</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p><p>You are a Perl expert with finance and trading experience. Also, you love wearing pajamas to work.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Perl expert. Yeah, no kidding. 90% of what we do server-side is Perl. Still a few of us left, and we refuse to go gently into the night.</li><li>Comfort with client-side Javascript/jQuery.</li><li>Required: deep&nbsp;familiarity with trading, investing,&nbsp;finance.</li><li>Ability to work remotely.</li></ul><p><strong>How to apply - (IMPORTANT)</strong></p><p>Please include&nbsp;a cover letter or note telling us why you are right for this specific position. <strong>Please write&nbsp;about your level of familiarity with trading and finance.</strong> Please look at and use our web site. Do not merely send a&nbsp;CV or resume and call it a day.

Social trading takes the activity of &quot;investing&quot; -- which previously happened only&nbsp;in private, like some kind of embarrassing biological process&nbsp;-- and brings it out into the sunshine so that other people can watch and benefit.</p><p>On Collective2's web site, you can find traders and investors that you like and admire, and follow along with them in your own brokerage account. Alternately, if you're a good trader, you can attract followers (and earn extra money doing so).</p><p>So Collective2's business touches a lot of interesting areas: finance, trading, automation, algorithms, big-data, risk analysis.</p><p><strong>Remote Only</strong></p><p>Collective2 is a &quot;distributed&quot; company - no central office, no cubicles, no pointy-headed managers. We are a team of men and women working together, full-time, from homes and coworking facilities all over the world.</p><p>We are a small company. We try to keep things on a human (and humane) scale. No politics, no corporate B.S.</p><p>Because we are small, every software developer has tremendous responsibility. We'll keep you challenged and happy.</p><p>And finally:</p><p>Be honest with yourself. The idea of working remotely sounds appealing, but it drives some percentage of the population bat-shit crazy. If you need proximity to warm human flesh, a foosball table, or a communal water cooler, this position probably isn't&nbsp;for you. But if you want to live anywhere&nbsp;you like in the world, dream of giving up your commute, and like the idea of working from&nbsp;the quiet and peace of your home, it might be perfect.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Competitive salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 Live anywhere, work anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 No commute!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Independent working environment                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flat structure                            </div>                    ",

As Intelligent Editing’s employee number four, you’ll have a wide set of responsibilities and the opportunity to contribute across as much of the business as interests you. That might include developing the next phase of our website; transforming our software (PerfectIt) to a SaaS model; or developing new products that will amaze anyone who thinks proofreading must be done manually.</p><p>You’ll work with a wide array of technologies (some of which you probably won’t be familiar with when joining). So a desire and ability to learn new tools is essential. We’re looking for a self-starter who will work on both new development and help modernise our existing codebase. You’ll be working directly with the founder &amp; CEO, as well as our Chief Engineer, to develop the tools that will allow the company to grow in the long term.</p><p>From the first day, you’ll be given a lot of responsibility, so you must be able to work and get things done independently. Although the core role is development, you shouldn’t be afraid to pitch in where needed (including admin, sales and support). In return, you’ll become well versed in a full set of skills valuable to any (or your own) startup.</p><p><strong>Duties and Responsibilities</strong></p><p>You will:</p><ul><li>Develop apps for online Office and add-ons for Google Docs</li><li>Contribute to the development of the next version of PerfectIt</li><li>Redesign our internal word usage databases</li><li>Improve our website</li><li>Work on e-commerce</li><li>Put in place unit tests and quality control mechanisms to improve our codebase.</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Intelligent Editing            </h2>            <div><p>Intelligent Editing launched in 2009. We’re not going to be the next Uber, and we don’t want to be. We like being small and profitable with a great team. We believe in steady growth, quality service and producing an excellent product.</p><p>We produce software that works with English-language documents. Our flagship software, PerfectIt, is an add-in for MS Word that finds mistakes that spelling and grammar checkers won’t find, such as consistency errors and style issues. The English language is a beast! And working to automate proofreading tasks for English is one of the most challenging and interesting aspects of our work.</p><p>We’re at the forefront of proofreading/editing technologies. We were among the first companies to produce apps for Office and add-ons for Google Docs, and we have plans to do more development in these environments as the next generation of word processors takes off.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p><strong>Flexible Working</strong></p><p>We have a team call every day between 3pm and 5pm (UK time). All other hours are flexible. If you produce great work, we don’t care when you do it.</p><p><strong>Remote Working</strong></p><p>Candidates should be based in the United Kingdom. Intelligent Editing has no offices, so candidates should be equipped to work from home.</p><p><strong>A Life Beyond Programming</strong></p><p>We believe that it’s impossible for developers to work more than forty hours per week and sustain quality.

We’re Action Verb.</p><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that Engineering and Marketing professionals use to power their products and services.</p><p>Our products include <a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and <a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><p>Our company consists of 8 full time USA-based Engineers, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America. We’re looking to grow our family by one or two faces.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of <a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong> As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about our Holacracy practice.</a></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that <strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about Open Book Management.</a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four quarterly meetings that are hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, and Detroit.</p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. <strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, <strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong> Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully Remote Company!

While these are required as foundational languages, being the first and primary developer for the projects you will be working on, you can enjoy the flexibility of working with any framework. We’re flexible, so even if you primarily work with C# or any other languages, but have experience developing web applications, send us your CV! :)</p><p>Although based in Australia, Avant8 has presence in the US and leverages it to deal with domestic brands and investors, specializing in turning around their distressed digital assets. Our team creates innovative solutions that work well under pressure allowing for new business models to tested rapidly in any market.</p><p>We’re looking for A-players, and part of that involves autonomy. You will be assigned tasks, both small and large, and a general time frame, but given the autonomy and freedom to schedule your own daily tasks as long as you complete what needs to get done. We understand and respect that you know development better than we do and it’s not our place to call unnecessarily strict or irrational deadlines and ways of completing tasks. This may be a good place to add that you should, when applying, mention in the cover letter your favorite food and, if you’re feeling ambitious, include a picture: this is to weed out applicants who mindlessly apply en masse to listings.</p><p>Given the above mentioned autonomy and freedom, you will be expected to debrief with a daily summary of what was accomplished, problems you ran into, what’s planned for the coming days, and maybe a joke or two. :)</p><p>We are a fun, friendly, and closely knit team, and although geographically distant, we have a strong work ethos and communicate regularly allowing for a very friendly and efficient work environment. Being a part of a new division within an established company, you get the best of both worlds in terms of job security and company culture. We work hard and expect the same from all of our team members.</p><p>We work hard, but we also play hard. You should come with a great sense of humor and a smile on your face, because you’ll have a few laughs and enjoy your time working with us. We reward hard work with a variety of perks incorporated in our flexible working environment.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Avant8 Pty Ltd            </h2>            <div><p>We are Australia-based Avant8 Pty Ltd. and we are looking for a motivated full-stack developer to join a new sector in our company that focuses on building digital assets in high trafficked industries, including but not limited to medical (health, wellness), finance, and social.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote working                            </div>                    ",

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developers who want to add to Kibana and X-Pack?

You can see our work at <a href='https://www.omgyes.com' rel='nofollow'>OMGYES.com</a></p><p>We get a huge amount of positive feedback from the press all over the world, and foremost from our users, who tell us how much it has helped their relationships and sex lives. It's been a wonderful, fulfilling journey.</p><p>What we need you to do<br>----------------------------<br>We're always working to keep our busy website (13m req/day) highly available, with minimal latency. We need you to design and implement new features that can scale accordingly. You will be making architectural decisions regarding data storage (database, NoSQL, client-side), content delivery (especially video across a wide range of devices), and gaining user insights through analytics.</p><p>Our users are distributed globally; we need to ensure we can serve a media-rich site in many languages to people all over the world. We need to support purchasing in a range of currencies, using different payment methods, with a careful eye to security.</p><p>Our backend was designed before launch. While it performs quite well, our site has evolved quite a bit since those days. We also have a new season of content that is in production. We've started a new project to build a more appropriate system, starting with season two content, and we want you to work with our front-end team to develop it, using modern best practices.</p><p>Who we're looking for<br>---------------------<br>You are completely at home in a server environment; both in the codebase and in the database. When someone proposes a new site feature, you've already assessed its impact on performance, designed a database schema, and half-architected the solution by the time they finish their pitch. As a full-stack developer, your emphasis is on the backend. You know the ins and outs of OWASP. You believe that design begins with data modeling, and your goal is instant gratification for all consumers of your APIs.</p><p>And, you are a scientist. You measure everything and make that data accessible, so you can make good decisions. You can frame improvements in terms of hypothesis and result, rather than conjecture.</p><p>You have more than 5 years of industry experience.</p><p>Technologies you should know<br>----------------------------<br>(In approximate order of importance, descending, not comprehensive!)</p><p>- MySQL / PostgreSQL<br>- Java (Spring Boot)<br>- Python / Ruby / Node.js (and your favorite web frameworks in each)<br>- Couchbase / Redis<br>- Varnish (and general principles of caching)<br>- AWS S3, EC2, Cloudfront (especially signed URLs)<br>- RESTful API design<br>- Git Flow<br>- Elasticsearch / Kibana / Logstash (self-hosted)<br>- Linux command line<br>- Video content delivery</p><p>Interested?<br>-----------<br>Send us your resume and a few words about why our project in particular interests you.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>(Included in job description)</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About OMGYes            </h2>            <div><p>OMGYes conducts large-scale scientific research into taboo topics like sexual pleasure.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer.

In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects.

We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>If you are local, we do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do.

That said... if you've got a different schedule in mind please apply and let us know what schedule works for you. &nbsp;If you are interested in what you read below please apply and we'll get you started on the process. Thanks ...the Carve team.</p><p><strong>What's the job?</strong></p><ul><li>Information security consulting: assessing the security of software and hardware systems.</li><li>Understanding how systems are built and learning how to break them.</li><li>Working with our experienced team on short-to-medium term engagements.</li></ul><p><strong>What would you do?</strong></p><p>Every two to three weeks you'll get a new project to work on. A typical project will involve:</p><ul><li><strong>Recon</strong>: Digging into the functionality, design, and implementation of the software system or device.</li><li><strong>Probing</strong>: Searching for implementation weaknesses which could indicate a security issue. This is a combination of tools that we use, tools that we build, and manual probing. For device projects this can include firmware extraction, analysis, and hardware interfacing.</li><li><strong>Extending</strong>: Now that you've found a weakness... how far can you extend your access into the system?</li><li><strong>Writing</strong>: Now that you've hacked your way in you'll need to write-up your findings and work with the developers to make sure they understand what the problem is and how to fix it.</li></ul><p>If you enjoy puzzles and technical variety you'll find this job very enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Who are we looking for?</strong></p><ul><li><em>You do not need to have information security experience.</em> If you've got the right technical background and problem solving skills we can train you in the dark arts of infosec.</li><li>People who enjoy writing code, solving problems with code, and learning how computers work at a fundamental level.</li><li>This is not a &quot;travel every week&quot; type of consultant. We do sometimes work at a client site but most of the time we do our projects remotely.</li></ul><p>We’re hiring for all experience levels: from zero career experience to information security veterans.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Deep experience in software and computers. You may have earned this experience with a degree, career as a software developer, or perhaps you've invested in a technical hobby that took you deep into the rabbit hole.</li><li>Technical writing skills (English)</li><li>Resident of the USA and able to be employed in the USA.</li></ul><p>We encourage remote candidates to reply *if* they are residents of the USA.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Carve Systems            </h2>            <div><p>We’re a team of security consultants who do more than hack. We combine engineering and consulting expertise to act as trusted advisors to the world’s largest companies.&nbsp;<br><br>Working at Carve lets you learn from some of the best and brightest in security - and they aren’t just on our team. We believe in engaging with the broader security community to stay on top of our game. You’ll have the opportunity to attend conferences, conduct research, and expand your horizons outside of project-based work. We always enjoy the endorphin rush from finally exploiting &quot;that bug&quot;, but we make a long-term effort to master both technical and consulting skills.<br><br>We are not chained to our computers. We like to stand up and get outside. We trail run, play music, ride bikes, and enjoy well-rounded lives.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p>Technologies:</p><p>NodeJS / JavaScript</p><p>Babel / ES6</p><p>RDMS: MySQL / Postgres</p><p>Amazon Web Services: EC2, Lambda, CloudFront, S3</p><p>GitHub</p><p>Apache Aurora / Mesos</p><p>Terraform</p><p>Docker</p><p>We’re open to new technologies too, in the right situation.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                        </p></div></span></div>",

A few months ago our recruiting process was going well enough that we had a comment in our HN post from a candidate we'd passed on who was happy enough with the experience that they recommended us in the thread [1]. Last month, however we had the exact opposite experience. Two candidates commented about investing significant effort in the process, only to be ghosted [2].</p><p>I arrived at those comments too late to reply, so I'm using this month's post to apologize. I dug into what happened here and found that we did indeed drop the ball with a few candidates and failed to follow up. Certainly it wasn't our intent and doesn't reflect our values. We've audited the entire candidate pool and have reached out to anyone that fell through the cracks to properly close the loop.  I personally apologize for your poor experiences and the criticism is well deserved.</p><p>I also want to thank the people who commented. I think posting that kind of feedback warning others is an excellent way to keep other members of the community informed, and hold each-other accountable. In this case we've overhauled and streamlined our processes so that we're confident this won't happen again in the future. So thank you for helping us do better, and I'm very sorry that this improvement came at the expense of your time.</p><p>We are hiring, positions are here: <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/elationhealth' rel='nofollow'>https://boards.greenhouse.io/elationhealth</a> and more about what we do at <a href='https://elationhealth.com' rel='nofollow'>https://elationhealth.com</a></p><p>As always, my contact info is in my profile and I'm happy to chat with anyone directly or answer any questions transparently in the comments (I'll monitor those today).</p><p>[1] <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14901945' rel='nofollow'>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14901945</a></p><p>[2] <a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15384536' rel='nofollow'>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15384536</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Now we’re leveraging that market-leading position to help the biggest brands on the planet take on one of the largest opportunities ever in enterprise software: unifying the front office.</p><p>And we’re bringing the very best talent in the world together to get there.</p><p><strong>What You'll Do</strong></p><p>We are currently seeking a person with extensive development and consulting experience.

We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything in this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!</p><p>As a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry.

Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.</p><p>We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller.  We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!). Check out our culture map.</p><p>Olo is an equal opportunity employer and diversity is valued at our company. All applicants receive consideration for employment.

Our first step is removing friction from transactions across the regulated economy by changing how compliance policies are built & managed.<br /><br />We’re a young and ambitious start-up aiming to dominate the RegTech category estimated to be worth $118.7bn by 2020. We’re early on our journey – you’ll join our team of 10! We have customers, are revenue generating, are based in the centre of London and have raised over £1.4m in Seed funding from London’s top early stage investors. We’re looking for outstanding people to help us shape the future of RegTech.<br /><br />We have developed a Smart Policy platform to enable regulated businesses to build & manage compliance policies programmatically. Our approach enables the automation and digitisation of tasks & actions previously performed by human compliance professionals. Every Smart Policy managed using PassFort benefits from our purpose-built case management application & third party integration marketplace ensuring that customer compliance profiles can be verified in real-time & evolve with changing requirements.<br /><br />We are building the infrastructure required to link the human concept of trust with the transformative technology of the internet. Doing so will enable every business (not just e-commerce businesses) to build customer relationships & transact online. The impacts for global economic development will be profound.<br /><br />*THE ROLE*<br /><br />We’re seeking a fantastic full stack engineer to help change the face of customer onboarding.

We have a service based architecture built on top of Kubernetes and Google’s Cloud Platform.<br /><br />*RESPONSIBILITIES*<br /><br />* Own the implementation of entire features, including technical design, implementation and release.<br />* Comfortable working across the codebase, learning new technologies and skills as the business requires.<br />* Provide technical guidance and mentorship to junior members of the team.<br />* Craft maintainable and testable code.<br /><br />*SKILLS*<br /><br />* A deep knowledge of either Python or Javascript, and at least a working knowledge of the other.<br />* Experience with Rust (or another compiled language) would also be great.<br />* Experience with React/Redux (or other SPA frameworks) a plus.<br />* Experience in DevOps (particularly Kubernetes) a plus.<br /><br />*BENEFITS*<br /><br />*PassFort is an amazing business to work in with a super exciting and executable vision. Our team members are rewarded well, not only from a salary perspective (££ DOE for this role) but also with:*<br /><br />* A homely environment in our Grade II listed offices in central London,<br />* An annual learning & development budget to spend on what you want,<br />* A monthly wellness budget (not restricted to gyms – go for a spa day or rock-climbing if you like),<br />* ‘Decide your own holiday’ entitlement,<br />* Pension contributions (investing in your future is important!),<br />* Pick your own equipment and kit, and not to forget,<br />* …Equity!<br /><br /><br />*Sound Interesting?

Or a front-end developer who knows Ruby?</p><p>Would you like to envision and develop the web platform for a team of dedicated usability researchers conducting cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc.)?</p><p>Then apply for the following full-time job at Baymard Institute – either working remotely or in Copenhagen, Denmark (or a mix!).</p><h3>About the Job</h3><p>Baymard Institute is a small independent web usability research organization, specialized in conducting large-scale generic usability studies of e-commerce sites. These studies are published as industry reports and benchmark databases at baymard.com (this site is a big part of the web platform you’ll be working on) – which is being used by thousands of web professionals, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.</p><p>In this position you will have a lot of influence on the technical direction of the company since all Baymard employees are e-commerce UX researchers except one (Jamie, co-founder of the business, and the person you’ll be working most closely together with). It’s an opportunity to help envision and build the technical platform of a company that works with tech but doesn’t sell it. (Because of this we’re also more than happy to open-source our internal code and scripts.)</p><p>If you’re looking for a chance to work on long-term goals rather than chasing monthly user growth targets, this will be a good match. We’re a business that has been profitable from day one and we really don’t care about temporarily spiking our user metrics in order to flip the company or impress VC investors. We’re much more interested in steady and sustainable improvements to our business – continually increasing the value we deliver to our customers (from which sustained increases in profitability organically follow). Since all of Baymard’s research is delivered through its website, your work will have an immediate and tangible impact on the company.</p><p>We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which many of our employees do). If you want to, you’re of course also welcome to work in our Copenhagen-based office.</p><p>Salary: in accordance with qualifications.</p><p>Start date: preferably before the end of 2017.</p><h3>Job Requirements</h3><p>You’re skills and interests must span from design to back-end coding. Strong skills in one area can compensate for a weaker side in other areas, but you’ll regularly be working across the spectrum of back-end programming, front-end code, and user interface design, and therefore must have basic skills in all these areas – and even more importantly: enjoy working in all of them!</p><p>Specifically, we’re looking for:</p><ul><li><strong>Back-end skills</strong> – basic programming chops is a requirement for this position, and solid back-end skills is considered a major plus. Familiarity with Ruby is a bonus, but by no means a necessity.</li><li><strong>Front-end skills</strong> – you should be confident in JavaScript and <span>CSS</span>, be able to appreciate concepts such as progressive enhancement, and care deeply about how all of these things tie together and how they impact the end-user experience.</li><li><strong>Design skills</strong> – while we’re definitely not looking for a graphic designer, you must be curious about design and how it shapes users’ perceptions, and enjoy thinking through and tweaking the user interfaces you’re building.</li><li><strong>Interest in UX and e-commerce</strong> is a bonus, but no experience or skills are necessary in this area as you’ll work with (and have the option to be trained by) the best in the business.</li><p></p></ul><p>We furthermore expect you to be fluent in english, comfortable working remotely via digital platforms and willing to do a few yearly travels for team meetups (expect 2-5 weeks of travel each year).</p><h3>Application</h3><p>If you’re interested in this position please send the following (listed in order of importance):</p><ol><li>Samples of back-end code you’ve written.</li><li>Samples of front-end code you’ve written.</li><li>Samples of user interfaces you’ve designed, been involved in designing, or helped implement (please indicate your level of involvement).</li><li>Other information you find relevant (hobbies, interests, work experience, CV, ..).</li></ol><p>Note: open-source contributions are perfectly fine as code samples – simply send along / point us towards whatever “work” you feel best represents your skills.</p><p>Deadline is October 13, 2017. However, we’ll review applications on an ongoing basis, so earlier applicants do have a better chance. All applications and materials are kept strictly confidential.</p><h3>How to apply</h3>",
