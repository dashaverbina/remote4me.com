We already have meaningful revenue, and a partnership with a multi-billion dollar global company.  Our CEO has previously been successful bootstrapping a software startup to a sustained 8-figure annual run rate, based on superior technology and sales execution. We do not intend to raise venture capital, which is a gigantic advantage given the current situation in the valley with the so-called unicorn meltdown.  This also means that stock option grants to employees can be vastly more generous than could otherwise be the case. </p><p>We are currently looking for as many as 2-3 linguists / computational linguists.  In this role, you will work on analysing textual data as part of a multi-faceted analysis whose goal is to predict the behaviour of organisations of varying types. Applications range from Human Capital Management, to Investor Intelligence and Countering Violent Extremism. The work is cutting-edge and highly varying in nature.</p><p>Desired Qualifications:</p><p>* Postgraduate degree in Linguistics, Computational Linguistics or a related field. Equivalent experience in the IC or military welcome.  Additional research and/or training in semantics, pragmatics and corpus linguistics preferred.  </p><p>* Experience in ontology development, grammar engineering, and the ability to<br>  abstract over language data.</p><p>* Programming competence - you should at least feel comfortable in a scripting language.</p><p>* Familiarity with language processing tools - for English and other languages.</p><p>* Native or near-native fluency in more than one language preferred - especially native French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, and Arabic speakers.</p><p>* Comfortable with performing both intellectually complex and mundane tasks as needed to advance the goals of the business.</p><p>* Prior start-up experience preferred.</p></div>",

    "content": "At Snowplow we are on a mission to empower people to use data to differentiate: by providing technology that gives them control of their data, and services that enable them to do amazing things with that control. As part of that effort, we're changing the way that people do digital analytics: moving companies away from having one-size-fits-all vendors like Google Analytics and Adobe dictate what should be done with their data, and enabling them to collect and own their data themselves, so they can decide:<br /><br />*What data they want to collect.<br />*What questions they want to ask of that data.<br />*How they want to answer those question. (What analyses techniques to employ, what tools to use to execute those analyses.)<br />*How they want to action the insight developed.<br /><br />We're looking for curiously brilliant individuals to join our Services team.<br /><br />*What the role entails:*<br /><br />The Services team at Snowplow helps companies take control of their data, enabling them to solve problems that previously were intractable and identify opportunities that previously were not visible.<br /><br />As a member of the Services team, you will:<br /><br />*help our clients understand what data needs to be captured, advise them on how to best structure it, and help them implement the tracking;<br />*work with our clients to take their Snowplow data and use it to build insights and design and build data-driven products;<br />*train our clients in our methodology and approach, including how to best use the different tools in the Snowplow arsenal;<br />*write blog posts and guides to help the broader Snowplow and Digital Analytics communities;<br /><br />You'll learn how to:<br /><br />*set up and run event data pipelines;<br />*best structure data so it can easily be used for analysis and real-time decisioning;<br />*architect data models (both relational and non-relational) and implement them in SQL and Spark;<br />*access the data in databases (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, neo4J, ...) and real-time (Elasticsearch, Kinesis, Lambda, ...);<br />*use modern data analysis tools (Python, Spark, )<br />*set up and use BI tools (Redash, Metabase, Superset, Looker, Tableau, ...);<br />*use data to solve actual business problems;<br />*and much more...<br /><br />You'll get an on-the-job training in digital analytics and an opportunity to work with some of the most data-sophisticated companies in the world. Snowplow is at the cutting edge of how digital analytics and this role is opportunity help us shape how the industry is changing<br /><br />*What we are looking for in a candidate:*<br /><br />*You love working with data and are excited to learn new tools and technologies.<br /><br />*You're self-motivated and prefer to learn by doing, failing, and trying again (often with minimal direction).<br /><br />*You're a clear thinker who is comfortable explaining her or his thinking, discussing and challenging different approaches, and working collaboratively and creatively to identify new approaches.<br /><br />*You're a good communicator.
