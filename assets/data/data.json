As part of that effort, we're changing the way that people do digital analytics: moving companies away from having one-size-fits-all vendors like Google Analytics and Adobe dictate what should be done with their data, and enabling them to collect and own their data themselves, so they can decide:<br /><br />*What data they want to collect.<br />*What questions they want to ask of that data.<br />*How they want to answer those question. (What analyses techniques to employ, what tools to use to execute those analyses.)<br />*How they want to action the insight developed.<br /><br />We're looking for curiously brilliant individuals to join our Services team.<br /><br />*What the role entails:*<br /><br />The Services team at Snowplow helps companies take control of their data, enabling them to solve problems that previously were intractable and identify opportunities that previously were not visible.<br /><br />As a member of the Services team, you will:<br /><br />*help our clients understand what data needs to be captured, advise them on how to best structure it, and help them implement the tracking;<br />*work with our clients to take their Snowplow data and use it to build insights and design and build data-driven products;<br />*train our clients in our methodology and approach, including how to best use the different tools in the Snowplow arsenal;<br />*write blog posts and guides to help the broader Snowplow and Digital Analytics communities;<br /><br />You'll learn how to:<br /><br />*set up and run event data pipelines;<br />*best structure data so it can easily be used for analysis and real-time decisioning;<br />*architect data models (both relational and non-relational) and implement them in SQL and Spark;<br />*access the data in databases (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, neo4J, ...) and real-time (Elasticsearch, Kinesis, Lambda, ...);<br />*use modern data analysis tools (Python, Spark, )<br />*set up and use BI tools (Redash, Metabase, Superset, Looker, Tableau, ...);<br />*use data to solve actual business problems;<br />*and much more...<br /><br />You'll get an on-the-job training in digital analytics and an opportunity to work with some of the most data-sophisticated companies in the world.
