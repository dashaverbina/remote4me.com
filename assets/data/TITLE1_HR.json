Expert Interviewer at Karat (<a href='https://karat.io' rel='nofollow'>https://karat.io</a>)<p>Work from anywhere in the world that has a solid internet connection. Work as much or as little as you want. Work any day, any time of day, any number of hours -- you can do 0 one week, 50 the next week, and back to 0 the next week. Only requirement there is that we want you to roughly average at least 10 hours a week, or else the training/time investment doesn't make as much sense from your end or ours. When each interview is done, you're done.</p><p>I know the above might sound a little strange, so a bit about the company for context: Karat is a Seattle-based startup that does software engineering interviews on behalf of other companies -- primarily first-round phone screens. Quickly-growing companies can spend a significant fraction of their engineers' time interviewing; we help take the load off. We've done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we're well-funded and growing quickly as a result.</p><p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we're looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you're strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.</p><p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather's like.</p><p>The application form is here: <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/karat/d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH' rel='nofollow'>https://jobs.lever.co/karat/d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a></p><p>I know it's a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I'm happy to talk through any of it.</p><p>P.S. We're also hiring for our internal team -- particularly looking for senior engineers right now; for those we generally prefer local (Seattle) candidates, though we do cover relocation. More details on those here: <a href='https://karat.io/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://karat.io/careers</a>, or feel free to email me if you have any questions.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"
