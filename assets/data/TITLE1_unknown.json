And we are searching for the next rockstar to add to our tribe.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Got someone in mind? If you refer the rockstar who we end up working with for more than 2 months, we’ll toss you a cool $5k for connecting everyone. :)</span></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We help people travel the world and spend more time with the people that mean most to them.

Check us out&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD_zDKlyozQg_7-Wl_8aBaw' rel='nofollow'>here</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>At the end of the day though, we're a small tribe of really smart and talented rockstars who are working together toward a common goal. And our goal is to completely transform the way people look at jobs they don’t love and entrepreneurship in America and around the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Our entire tribe is remote, so you get to work from anywhere. We are innovating left and right and we do work that changes lives.</div><div><br></div><div>We work hard, get shit done and are insanely informal.</div><div><br></div><div>Don't believe me? What if we did handstands?</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>BOOM. Handstands.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway... Back to the good stuff.</div><div><br></div><div>We deliver an amazing product to help all of our students and are doing a very very amazing job at marketing and changing people’s lives... which has allowed us to grow really fast.</div><div><br></div><div>But, because of all the growth, some of us have gotten way too busy… Which is where you come in… If you want to go fast.</div><div><br></div><div><span>&quot;I wanna go fast&quot;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>-Ricky Bobby</span></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h2><span>This is for you if:</span></h2></div><ul><li>You’re great at taking ideas and running with them, making sure they’re executed perfectly</li><li>You have an obsessive drive to grow and learn, and do things the right way the first time.</li><li>You are process driven, and good at problem-solving and figuring things out on your own with minimal direction… you can create your own structured work environment.</li><li>You actively read and seek out new learning from books or courses to get better at your role</li><li>You implement. And do so with minimal direction, doing a lot of your own research to find the best way to solve the problem at hand.</li><li>You want to learn how to run profitable internet businesses from the inside, and help build toward big scary goals.</li><li>Lastly and most importantly, you have an unquestioned work ethic. You have a very strong desire to work hard, put in extra time and learn in your off hours.</li></ul><div>If you question your will to work hard, more than the normal 8-4 or 9-5 days, this probably isn’t the best position to apply for.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We hate normal jobs, and the 9-5 grind. We believe that regular jobs suck - which is why we never want to be a regular cut-and-paste team with cubicles... or holier-than-thou mission statements... while doing little for the world.</div><div><br></div><div>We have big, scary goals, and are surrounding ourselves with a small tribe of rockstars that are as excited as we are about the goal, so that there is no such thing as ‘work’.

    "content": "About Koru Kids<br />Koru Kids is London’s fastest growing childcare brand. We’re making it easier and more affordable for families to access high quality childcare.<br /><br />Our after school service matches parents in London with the top 10% of student nannies in London and our nanny share service helps families to share nannies with other local families.<br /><br />We don’t just believe in providing outstanding childcare to families, we are all about using technology to make it seamless for parents. We’ve been blown away by the response from parents and are consistently beating our growth targets.<br /><br />We are backed by fantastic investors, including top venture capitalists and business angels such as Michael Pennington the founder of Gumtree. We won the South of England region in the ‘Best of Britain’ awards 2017, and are currently shortlisted for several awards: the UK Business Awards 2017 as ‘Disruptor of the Year’, and in the Best Women Awards 2017 as ‘Best New Business’, ‘Best Technology’ and ‘Best company working with children and families’.<br /><br />About the Team<br />We have an informal, hard-working and kind team culture. We’re all passionate about our mission and are determined to create the world’s leading childcare brand. Every team member plays a vital role in achieving our goals and we work together so we can get there quicker. Our approach is fast paced – we are constantly challenging, testing and adapting the way we do things.<br /><br />Our founder is Rachel Carrell, the former CEO of DrThom.com, the world’s largest online doctor service, which she grew to over 1.3m paying users in 3 countries. She’s an Oxford alumn, ex-McKinsey, a Rhodes Scholar and a WEF Young Global Leader. Rachel’s joined by an amazing team with backgrounds including Cambridge, UCL, BCG, KPMG, and some of London’s top startups.<br /><br />We take great care with who we hire and all team members are superbly talented and most importantly really nice! If you’re brilliant AND humble, you’ll fit right in.<br /><br />About the role<br />We have huge growth plans for the business and we need someone to help us take our acquisition to the next level.<br /><br />You don’t need any prior marketing experience but you do need to be pro-active, a fast learner and not afraid to try new things.<br /><br />This role will suit someone who enjoys testing new ideas, validating them and gets a kick out of figuring out how to make things work. You need to be analytical and comfortable with numbers. You’ll be organised, comfortable working at a fast pace and able to task switch.<br /><br />You'll be comfortable taking ownership and be responsible for all our acquisition channels including Facebook, Google, SERP, Referrals and more.<br /><br />You’ll also spend time working on customer-facing operations. This means speaking to mums (sometimes dads and nannies, but usually mums) on the phone, and emailing/texting them. This will probably be at least 20% of the job. You’ll get to know our parents, what their needs are and therefore how we can best acquire new ones.<br /><br /><br />Your normal hours of work will be 9am to 6.30pm on weekdays but there may be times when late night are required to cope with spikes in demand. We know you have a private life and other commitments and we work as a team to make sure everyone has a good balance. You’ll normally work from our offices near Old St, although if you like to occasionally work from home that’s totally fine too we support flexibility as long as the work gets done!<br /><br />3 reasons this role is great: <br />1.    You will learn a TON. Marketing will be your main focus, but you’ll get plenty of exposure to operations, product, technology and other aspects of the business. You’ll learn how to found a business, about operations, marketing, technology, and finance. <br />2.    You’ll be making a huge difference to the everyday lives of parents in London. We’re building a business that will profoundly benefit children, women, and families. <br />3.    We’re well-connected in the startup world, so working with us will open lots of doors for you even if you leave. We’ve got a strong track record of helping people we’ve worked with<br /><br />About you<br />We’re after an all-rounder who is clever, practical, positive and nice. We don’t mind what degree you’ve done, as long as you’ve done well in it. We’ll also be looking for evidence of spark and energy in the extracurricular stuff you’ve done.<br /><br />Ideally you will have about 1-2 years of experience in the workforce already.<br /><br />You need to have excellent English – you’ll be writing compelling and concise copy to catch parents attention.<br /><br />You’ll be a key member of our team, and you’ll get all the training, coaching and support you need to do these things well.<br /><br />Essential skills <br />•    You’re able to write clearly, simply and accurately, with perfect spelling and grammar <br />•    You like working with numbers and data. We love people who love analysis <br />•    You’re comfortable with speaking to new people, both in person and on the phone <br />•    You’re emotionally intelligent. Although you’ll like to talk, the most important thing you’ll do is listen. Choosing childcare is an emotional decision, and you’ll need to help parents through the process <br />•    You’re a problem-solver. As we are a young company, there aren’t many fixed processes yet. That means you can create new processes, make suggestions, and tell us we’re doing things wrong <br />•    You roll with it. You understand that startups are unpredictable environments. You are comfortable with a degree of chaos <br />•    You’re nice. You get that no player is bigger than the team. You fit right into our culture of supporting and helping each other.<br /><br />Skills/experience that are not essential but would be fantastic <br />•    Passion for design or photography (you would need your own equipment, but again we could certainly create opportunities for you to practice)<br /><br />Benefits <br />•    Competitive salary dependent on experience <br />•    We work from a beautiful co-working space near Old St in central London. The office has a gym and showers, bike storage, free snacks and drinks, and a programme of social events.",

    "content": "*INTRODUCTION*<br /><br />Hello. We are a well-established, high-growth, investor-backed consulting firm. Very much boutique, with an almost startup-like approach and feel, we have big company ambitions. And a track record to prove it.<br /><br />*OUR CULTURE?*<br /><br />Tech-savvy, innovative, entrepreneurial, collaborative. Our consultants are fiercely loyal and this is borne out by a very low attrition rate.<br /><br />*WHAT DOES A TYPICAL DAY LOOK LIKE?*<br /><br />* Imagine owning the proof of concept, design, architecture, development and delivery of client solutions.<br />* Imagine engaging with developers, business analysts, change professionals, project managers and other stakeholders.<br />* Imagine being the face of the firm, showcasing solutions, outlining benefits, identifying future business opportunities.<br />* Imagine using your business acumen to ensure technical implementations are fit for purpose.<br /><br />*WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE ROLE?*<br /><br />In many ways you will feel like your own boss. You will need to be independent, adaptable and able to travel extensively throughout APAC and at times, globally, to client sites. The role will bring lots of autonomy and flexibility including a significant opportunity for remote working.<br /><br />*WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES?*<br /><br />If you enjoy the formal structure of a corporate environment then this is not for you.

Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>ACT’s Core Infrastructure team is seeking fundraisers to help build the zero carbon footprint future version of our planet. Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>We believe that the core problem of global warming is lack of global collaboration. Our goal is to support and enhance global collaboration facilitated by an ecosystem of carefully crafted software systems. Just like Wikipedia is a computer facilitated collaboration platform around building the world’s biggest encyclopedia – so will ACT enable collaboration around green shopping and help humans ACT together for a sustainable planet so that we can do our part to end global warming and also support fair trade.</p><p>- ACT is software technology with smart gamification to connect consumers around sustainable shopping and collaboration.<br>- The immediate goal of ACT is to reduce climate gasses and possibly be the “solution” to global climate change.<br>- ACT is a role model of a democratic organization: Max factor of 8 between highest and lowest paid, all employees has 1 vote, no person or organization can own voting shares (i.e. no external organization can control ACT, which is important to keep us a partner of independent advice).<br>- All software is expected to be open source and free, so that all can take action.</p><p>We have just finished a major design phase and now wish to start serious development of the software platform. We are looking to tell the world about our extraordinary solution for ACTion, that we believe will change the way we manage global climate change almost overnight.</p><p>We need to strengthen our team, our advisory board and council with experienced resources within multiple fields: Management, Communication/journalism/marketing, Financial management, Fundraising, Life cycle analysis &amp; research, Graphical design, Web development, Mobile development, Backend development, Networking.</p><p>WHY ACT?<br>Have you ever thought that it is impossible to solve global climate change and that your effort would mean so little?</p><p>What if you had the chance to work with one of the most ambitious climate change projects? We believe that ACT is one of the most hands-on solutions to mitigating climate change. These might sound like just 'great words,' but do the math yourself: E.g. If only 1700 people decided to use ACT to find the least fossil fuel consuming goods, service alternatives and register their purchases it would deliver a combined purchasing power of 63 million USD/year after tax*, which is the same amount Norway uses to conserve the Amazonas rainforest! And those 1700 people could decide to ACT tomorrow!</p><p>* Assuming a salary of 37,000 USD/year after tax.</p><p>JOB DESCRIPTION, FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS<br>ACT is now selling shares and applying for funding with various organizations. We need 2 highly motivated FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS to join our Core team in this exciting phase that will have a serious impact on sustainability of our planet. </p><p>At best the following requirements apply to you:</p><p>- You have applied and won support from Innovasjon Norge on multiple occasions.<br>- You have applied and won support from various other foundations.<br>- You have experience from selling shares.<br>- You have a good network.<br>- You have a good command of English.</p><p>The fundraisers will work closely with co-founders and be a part of our small team of entrepreneurs with a flat organizational structure. Since the company is in an early phase you will be able to shape your role in the company exactly how you like it best.</p><p>WORK PLACE<br>This job should at best be carried out as much as possible in co-location with ACT in Oslo, but we are open to remote work too.</p><p>APPLICATION<br>Please send your CV and some words introducing yourself, why you want to work with ACT, highlight relevant previous experience and your current situation.</p><p>For more information about this job and ACT please contact:</p><p>Thomas Jepsen<br>President, Founder &amp; CTO<br>ACT Cooperative Corporation AS</p></div>",
