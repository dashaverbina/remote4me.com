It’s very normal for a successful first year consultant to make $60,000-$70,000, with these numbers reaching $80,000 by year 2.</strong></p><p><strong>2.) Job responsibilities for the Academic Consultant position:</strong></p><p><strong>The entirety of this job will be handling communications with existing and potential clients of the company, both in terms of managing existing services as well as selling new services, as well as reviewing and delivering work from independent contractors.

Ability to review work deliverables in comparison to assignment details</strong></p><p><strong>B. Ability to respond properly to client requests and concerns</strong></p><p><strong>C. Ability to speak to clients properly by phone</strong></p><p><strong>D.

All candidates will receive the exact same assessment. All candidates will receive an immediate $500 signon bonus if they are onboarded for training (which is also paid at the $3500/month rate)</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

The most important part of this is the “delegation sessions” you’ll conduct with each Entrepreneur. In these sessions, you’ll help them “unpack” their To-Do list into small enough projects their (forthcoming) Assistant can take over with maximum ease and flow.</li><li>You’ll source and interview Assistant candidates. Your intimate knowledge of our Entrepreneur-clients’ businesses will help you find winning Assistants.</li><li>You’ll monitor the progress of our Entrepreneur-clients to make sure they’re completing their assigned prep work.</li><li>Lastly, you’ll be asked to review and optimize our onboarding processes to improve both the speed of onboarding, as well as the success rate of Entrepreneur-Assistant matches.</li></ul><p><strong>Outcomes You’ll be Held Accountable To</strong></p><ul><li><strong>12 hours or less per match:</strong>&nbsp;each Entrepreneur Executive Assistant match requires a series of steps; you’ll be expected accomplish each match within 12 work-hours or less.</li><li><strong>Work with up to 12 clients per month</strong></li><li><strong>Meet “Days to Match” goal of 15 days or less.</strong>&nbsp;We measure the length of time from Entrepreneur’s first meeting with you to the time they get introduced to their Assistant.</li><li><strong>Achieve “Trial Period Stick Rate” of 80% or higher.</strong>&nbsp;When matches happen, there is a 90-day trial period for Entrepreneurs and Assistants to test-drive each other.

All details and checkpoints matter.</li><li><strong>Strong Listening Skills:</strong>&nbsp;Strong ability in empathic/reflective listening required. Often match-making requires deep listening to “read between the lines.” Listen more than you speak.</li><li><strong>An instinct to close loops / strong follow-through.&nbsp;</strong>Entrepreneurs are very busy so it’s up to you to stay in touch and follow through to ensure that they are getting the white-glove treatment.</li><li><strong>Comfortable with being on-screen during live remote meetings.&nbsp;</strong>Your workspace should be neat, clean and project a professional image.

The first sniff of any of these three, or any violation of our Core Values, and your participation will be under immediate review.</p><p>In our culture, there’s ample room for growth, mistakes, and learning. Mistakes of ambition are okay, where you’ve given a task or project your best shot, but missed your mark. You (and we) can learn and get better from that.

We empower you to create the startup experience that you want and give you the opportunities to challenge yourself. We expect that you walk away from this with the necessary skills and knowledge to launch your own startup.</p><p>This internship will let get your hands dirty in all parts of the business. From hustling, growth hacking, community building, business development, operations, product development, leading a team, customer care to cooking, no two days are ever the same and we like it that way. If you want to wake up knowing exactly how your day will end then this is probably not the right role for you.</p><p>And yep, we also feed you a lot of really good food (that's a given).</p></div></div><div><div>Compensation</div><div>$1K–$2K<br>No Equity</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to dahmakan (YC S17)</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/252929-head-of-operations?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/252929-head-of-operations?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Head of Operations</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/252929-head-of-operations?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>dahmakan (YC S17)</a></div><div>Malaysia, Asia</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/munchh-pvt-ltd/jobs/199615-internships?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/munchh-pvt-ltd/jobs/199615-internships?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Internships</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/munchh-pvt-ltd/jobs/199615-internships?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Munchh</a></div><div>Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/113989-summer-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/113989-summer-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Summer Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/113989-summer-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Forkable</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/statslateral/jobs/275474-founding-market-research-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/statslateral/jobs/275474-founding-market-research-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Founding Market Research Manager</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/statslateral/jobs/275474-founding-market-research-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>StatsLateral</a></div><div>Toronto</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/worq/jobs/146664-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/worq/jobs/146664-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/worq/jobs/146664-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>WORQ</a></div><div>Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/114401-intern-anytime?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/114401-intern-anytime?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Intern (Anytime)</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/114401-intern-anytime?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Forkable</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/252922-vp-of-growth?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/252922-vp-of-growth?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>VP of Growth</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/252922-vp-of-growth?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>dahmakan (YC S17)</a></div><div>Malaysia, South East Asia, Asia</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/merkle-8/jobs/324101-crypto-financial-indices-product-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/merkle-8/jobs/324101-crypto-financial-indices-product-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Crypto financial indices Product...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/merkle-8/jobs/324101-crypto-financial-indices-product-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Merkle Data</a></div><div>Palo Alto, New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/150377-offline-marketing-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/150377-offline-marketing-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Offline Marketing Manager</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/150377-offline-marketing-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>dahmakan (YC S17)</a></div><div>Malaysia</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>What We're Building</h3></div><div><div><p>Eating well everyday is simple: At the push of a button, dahmakan delivers Chef-made meals straight to your door.

You will constantly be challenged to learn new technologies and extend your knowledge of Iridium’s products. &nbsp;We offer a very agile and empowered environment – if you have a great idea, speak up and present it to the team. If the team loves your idea, then we will look for you to implement it.&nbsp;</p><p>Iridium is an 8-year old company that thinks it is still a startup.&nbsp; What is nice is that we have the startup attitude, but also offer stable and long-term employment with a company that has positive cash flow and is not concerned about running out of money.&nbsp; We offer the start-up mindset, but without the fear that we will close our doors next month.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking for a relaxing job where you can work 8-5 Monday through Friday, then this is not the job for you. The Iridium work experience is fast-paced and high intensity. You will be a member of a team of extremely talented and highly skilled technical employees. We all bring our “whatever it takes attitude” to solving both technical and client issues. You will be empowered to showcase your technical skills and grit on a daily basis. You will be given massive responsibility and be expected to independently manage yourself. We can promise overtime, late nights, and even some weekend work. But we can also promise a great sense of achievement, and a supportive team environment that makes it all worthwhile. Are you a hard-charger? If so, you will fit right in and you will love working here.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from your home office</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>UNLIMITED vacation policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Will invest into your development</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>New laptop</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Our product powers predictions for millions of users each month, and our customers range from e-commerce businesses to F250 companies.</p><p>We’re primarily based in Central London, but have a mixed remote and onsite team. We’re funded by top-tier infrastructure investors from the West Coast, and the founders are both technical and ex-YC / PhD. Salaries are competitive and include stock options.</p><p>We’re a tech heavy team with a flat structure and friendly atmosphere. We’re big believers in self-organising teams within an agile environment that put a heavy focus on creating user value first.</p><p>Our tech stack: Kotlin / Java 8, Python 3, numpy/scipy, Django, Typescript &amp; React, Apache Big Data projects, Linux &amp; Kubernetes</p><p>We’re hiring for the following roles:</p><p>- Frontend Developer (ONSITE) - We are looking for someone to lead the development of the front-end, developing on our existing workflow builder. We are open-minded in terms of technologies, but would be most comfortable architecting the product using React and TypeScript along with modern CSS UI libraries, so experience with these would be ideal. This will be a flexible role with a really unique scope for ownership and growth.</p><p>- Devops Engineer (ONSITE / REMOTE) - We’re developing the NStack PaaS to run on top of Kubernetes and many Google Cloud services, and are looking for a DevOps engineer with a focus on data engineering, CI/CD and deployment. The core NStack platform runs on the JVM using many tools from the Apache Big Data stack, along with large amounts of Python. We’re also heavy users of Linux containerisation, and NStack workflows are distributed on Kubernetes.</p><p>- Data Scientist (ONSITE) - We’re looking for an amazing Data Scientist to join our current data team to build reusable data-driven components and applications on the NStack platform. Ideally you’d have experience working as a data scientist in a team using Python (pandas, sklearn, numpy). Knowledge of the Big Data world (e.g. Hadoop, Spark, etc.), alongside an understanding of cloud and data infrastructure would be a bonus, as would experience with Bayesian statistical models and AutoML systems.</p><p>- Data Science Intern (ONSITE) - To join our growing Data Science team as described above</p><p>We’re looking at a range of positions and experience levels - whether you’ve just left uni or been hacking for 20 years, if you’re interested please get in touch. Any questions please comment, DM, reach out on email (jobs at nstack dot com) or at <a href='https://angel.co/nstack/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/nstack/jobs</a>.

Okay maybe Jedis, just for this one.<br />- A close bond and experience with Java and the Android SDK.<br />- A passion for using Android in your daily life. You're not just visiting, you live here. You also know your way around macOS and can appreciate Windows and iOS – from a distance  <br />- Excitement for the unknown and humility to learn – we're agile, so new things are always ready to be passed (and sometimes dodged).<br />- A penchant for clean code that's easy to read.<br /><br />What you might also have<br /><br />- Personal experience with 1Password.<br />- Familiarity with setting up and maintaining continuous integration.<br />- A friendship with Kotlin, and practice making it part of an Android app.<br />- Chrome OS running on one of your devices, and experience building apps for it.<br /><br />If you're a match<br /><br />Sounding like a jersey you’d rock?
