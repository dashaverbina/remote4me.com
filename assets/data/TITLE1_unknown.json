    "content": "*INTRODUCTION*<br /><br />Hello. We are a well-established, high-growth, investor-backed consulting firm. Very much boutique, with an almost startup-like approach and feel, we have big company ambitions. And a track record to prove it.<br /><br />*OUR CULTURE?*<br /><br />Tech-savvy, innovative, entrepreneurial, collaborative. Our consultants are fiercely loyal and this is borne out by a very low attrition rate.<br /><br />*WHAT DOES A TYPICAL DAY LOOK LIKE?*<br /><br />* Imagine owning the proof of concept, design, architecture, development and delivery of client solutions.<br />* Imagine engaging with developers, business analysts, change professionals, project managers and other stakeholders.<br />* Imagine being the face of the firm, showcasing solutions, outlining benefits, identifying future business opportunities.<br />* Imagine using your business acumen to ensure technical implementations are fit for purpose.<br /><br />*WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE ROLE?*<br /><br />In many ways you will feel like your own boss. You will need to be independent, adaptable and able to travel extensively throughout APAC and at times, globally, to client sites. The role will bring lots of autonomy and flexibility including a significant opportunity for remote working.<br /><br />*WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES?*<br /><br />If you enjoy the formal structure of a corporate environment then this is not for you. You will need be self-motivated and versatile enough to wear multiple hats i.e. consultant, project manager, business analyst, technician, mentor, advisor. You will have a network of consultants to support you in the early days but thereafter you will be expected to stand on your own two feet.<br /><br />*WHAT'S MY BACKGROUND?*<br /><br />You come from a technical hands-on development (.NET, Java, C# or similar) environment but now operate in a more strategic, consultative, client-facing role which might encompass disciplines such as solution architecture, business analysis, project management and the like.<br /><br />*PROGRESSION?*<br /><br />This is a fantastic opportunity to be part of an exciting success story and to grow with a firm that has world-class ambitions. In many ways progression will be exactly what you make it.<br /><br />*WHAT TECHNICAL SKILLS WILL I NEED?*<br /><br />* Programming background in .NET, Java, C# or similar.<br />* An understanding of object-orientated, structured development methodologies.<br /><br />*WHAT BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE WILL I NEED?*<br /><br />* Good understanding of project management, software development life cycles, structured programming methods and controls.<br />* An affinity for consulting, business analysis, change management, process re-engineering, business transformation.<br />* Prior experience of designing and implementing documented, supportable and extensive developments for clients.<br />* Able to solve business and technical challenges by using innovative and well-planned approaches.<br /><br />*SOFT SKILLS?*<br /><br />* Highly personable, engaging, client-facing, confident, credible, articulate, consultative, affable, charismatic.<br />* Gravitas and credibility to face off to senior business stakeholders, able to instil confidence.<br />* Sixth sense for identifying, troubleshooting and remediating issues, both business and technical.<br />* Sound commercial nous coupled with excellent stakeholder management skills and a strong technical background.<br />* Able to tailor a message to the audience, combined with exceptional presentation skills.<br />* International outlook and exposure, you will most likely have worked abroad at some point.<br />* Bilingual Japanese/English skills are essential.<br /><br />*THE NUMBERS?*<br /><br />JPY 12,000,000 + excellent benefits + share options.<br /><br />*INTERESTED?*<br /><br />Please apply including a copy of your CV and cover letter (yes we're a bit old school like that). We look forward to hearing from you.",

Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>ACT’s Core Infrastructure team is seeking fundraisers to help build the zero carbon footprint future version of our planet. Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>We believe that the core problem of global warming is lack of global collaboration. Our goal is to support and enhance global collaboration facilitated by an ecosystem of carefully crafted software systems. Just like Wikipedia is a computer facilitated collaboration platform around building the world’s biggest encyclopedia – so will ACT enable collaboration around green shopping and help humans ACT together for a sustainable planet so that we can do our part to end global warming and also support fair trade.</p><p>- ACT is software technology with smart gamification to connect consumers around sustainable shopping and collaboration.<br>- The immediate goal of ACT is to reduce climate gasses and possibly be the “solution” to global climate change.<br>- ACT is a role model of a democratic organization: Max factor of 8 between highest and lowest paid, all employees has 1 vote, no person or organization can own voting shares (i.e. no external organization can control ACT, which is important to keep us a partner of independent advice).<br>- All software is expected to be open source and free, so that all can take action.</p><p>We have just finished a major design phase and now wish to start serious development of the software platform. We are looking to tell the world about our extraordinary solution for ACTion, that we believe will change the way we manage global climate change almost overnight.</p><p>We need to strengthen our team, our advisory board and council with experienced resources within multiple fields: Management, Communication/journalism/marketing, Financial management, Fundraising, Life cycle analysis &amp; research, Graphical design, Web development, Mobile development, Backend development, Networking.</p><p>WHY ACT?<br>Have you ever thought that it is impossible to solve global climate change and that your effort would mean so little?</p><p>What if you had the chance to work with one of the most ambitious climate change projects? We believe that ACT is one of the most hands-on solutions to mitigating climate change. These might sound like just 'great words,' but do the math yourself: E.g. If only 1700 people decided to use ACT to find the least fossil fuel consuming goods, service alternatives and register their purchases it would deliver a combined purchasing power of 63 million USD/year after tax*, which is the same amount Norway uses to conserve the Amazonas rainforest! And those 1700 people could decide to ACT tomorrow!</p><p>* Assuming a salary of 37,000 USD/year after tax.</p><p>JOB DESCRIPTION, FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS<br>ACT is now selling shares and applying for funding with various organizations. We need 2 highly motivated FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS to join our Core team in this exciting phase that will have a serious impact on sustainability of our planet. </p><p>At best the following requirements apply to you:</p><p>- You have applied and won support from Innovasjon Norge on multiple occasions.<br>- You have applied and won support from various other foundations.<br>- You have experience from selling shares.<br>- You have a good network.<br>- You have a good command of English.</p><p>The fundraisers will work closely with co-founders and be a part of our small team of entrepreneurs with a flat organizational structure. Since the company is in an early phase you will be able to shape your role in the company exactly how you like it best.</p><p>WORK PLACE<br>This job should at best be carried out as much as possible in co-location with ACT in Oslo, but we are open to remote work too.</p><p>APPLICATION<br>Please send your CV and some words introducing yourself, why you want to work with ACT, highlight relevant previous experience and your current situation.</p><p>For more information about this job and ACT please contact:</p><p>Thomas Jepsen<br>President, Founder &amp; CTO<br>ACT Cooperative Corporation AS</p></div>",

Everything technology-related will be under your purview. And at least initially, you will be the only person on our team focused on tech full-time.</p><p>Our culture is casual with a start-up feel.

Knowing that however much polish you add, it's still a turd? Or perhaps you're one of a 10-person marketing department where getting an idea tested requires more&nbsp;political acumen than creative genius?&nbsp;Or maybe you love your work but hate the commute, and the costs to your lifestyle?</div><div><br></div><div>Secret Benefits is a sugar dating site that users love, has no bureaucracy, and understands that life comes before work. We're only a young site but according to this user, we're doing OK:</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;It’s fantastic!! Amazing like life changing! Thank you very much!! A very satisfied customer!!&quot;<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>This testimonial's so glowing that&nbsp;I'd be foolish to make&nbsp;it up.&nbsp;I considered fixing the grammar but decided I liked&nbsp;the&nbsp;rawness. As a marketer, you understand that changing lives is a good start but there's more to success. We may have thousands of users but most people haven't heard of us, like you before seeing this curious job listing -- come help us change that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you've got any experience getting the word out about a product, or in generating publicity, we want to hear from you.&nbsp;When you join, you'll make up 50% of our dedicated marketing team. You'll interact daily with the co-owners, and have&nbsp;your ideas live and tested almost as quickly as you come up with them.&nbsp;Spend time implementing, and reviewing your concepts, not waiting for them to be approved&nbsp;by 3 VPs.</div><div><br></div><div>We're a young, motivated team that's entirely remote and distributed globally. Sick of that commute, or reminding the in-person team that you're still alive? Here we're all in the same position. You dictate when and where&nbsp;you do the work --&nbsp;fit it around your life without feeling guilty.</div><div><br></div><div>We know little about Social Media and PR. These are the&nbsp;two major gaps we're trying to fill. But if you've got experience in other areas like email marketing, PPC, branding, or anything else, we'd still love to hear from you. &nbsp;</div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>To apply, please send your best proof of being able to help us to <a href='mailto:apply@secretbenefits.com' rel='nofollow'>apply@secretbenefits.com</a> Hint: A track record of success, particularly if it's in PR or social media, is what we're especially interested in.</p>  </div>",
