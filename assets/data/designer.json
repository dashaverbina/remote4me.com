We see a world where everyone wins—where open source developers have abundant reasons to keep innovating and maintaining their creations and open source users get software they can depend on.</p><p>This is an opportunity to shape the culture of a new team while building a product from scratch. Our company is well-funded and you'll have the support you need to make things happen. After a few years with us, you'd be able to say you were one of the first members of the team and that you had primary responsibility for building a new product.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>We’re looking for a great designer, with the additional ability to craft clean CSS and HTML as their work product. If you know how to make a theme for a CSS framework (such as Bootstrap or Bulma), that's the skillset we have in mind. Deep JavaScript skills or development skills would be a bonus in this job but are not at all required; we're looking for someone who's primarily a designer.</p><p>We would prefer it if you have some formal training in a design field, such as visual design, HCI, or interaction design. However you obtained it, you should have a solid design background, including knowledge of industry tools, an understanding of formal design principles and typography, experience with applying a brand identity, collateral systems, and the ability to synthesize information to better inform design decisions.</p><p>You should have an appreciation for and awareness of web design considerations, including user expectations, responsiveness, accessibility, information architecture, and other relevant practices in the field of web design. </p><p>You would be working on web design across the company; we're guessing about 70% on product (our application) and 30% on marketing (such as landing pages and email templates). We've been working on our brand kit and visual identity, which you would use to build designs for new pages and UX elements. (Our new look isn't on tidelift.com yet... perhaps you could help us with that!)</p><p>You will be a creative partner who helps us think through our product offering and associated communications, so you should be comfortable collaborating with others with different backgrounds, job descriptions, and skill sets.</p><p>We are eager to consider all qualified applicants regardless of color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital or family status, disability, gender identity or expression, veteran status, actual or presumed belonging to an ethnic group, or any other legally protected status. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please let us know.</p><p>In this role, you would have the option to work remotely from a US time zone, or from our office in Boston. We’ll discuss other flexible arrangements as well, let us know what you need.</p><p><strong>About our team</strong></p><p>We’re just getting started, but here’s the goal. We’d like to build a product development team passionate about making a difference to others, with relevant software that helps people.

We want to hire people who get along with others and care deeply about how their work will be used.</p><p>Our company aims for work-life harmony; we believe in doing good work, with urgency and pragmatism, but at a sustainable pace. We do not expect long hours, but we do strive to have an impact.</p><p><strong>How to apply</strong></p><p>Fill out the form below.

We see a world where everyone wins—where open source developers have abundant reasons to keep innovating and maintaining their creations and open source users get software they can depend on.<br><br>This is an opportunity to shape the culture of a new team while building a product from scratch. Our company is well-funded and you'll have the support you need to make things happen. After a few years with us, you'd be able to say you were one of the first members of the team and that you had primary responsibility for building a new product.<br><br><strong>About you</strong><br><br>We’re looking for a great designer, with the additional ability to craft clean CSS and HTML as their work product. If you know how to make a theme for a CSS framework (such as Bootstrap or Bulma), that's the skillset we have in mind. Deep JavaScript skills or development skills would be a bonus in this job but are not at all required; we're looking for someone who's primarily a designer.<br><br>We would prefer it if you have some formal training in a design field, such as visual design, HCI, or interaction design. However you obtained it, you should have a solid design background, including knowledge of industry tools, an understanding of formal design principles and typography, experience with applying a brand identity, collateral systems, and the ability to synthesize information to better inform design decisions.<br><br>You should have an appreciation for and awareness of web design considerations, including user expectations, responsiveness, accessibility, information architecture, and other relevant practices in the field of web design. <br><br>You would be working on web design across the company; we're guessing about 70% on product (our application) and 30% on marketing (such as landing pages and email templates). We've been working on our brand kit and visual identity, which you would use to build designs for new pages and UX elements. (Our new look isn't on tidelift.com yet... perhaps you could help us with that!)<br><br>You will be a creative partner who helps us think through our product offering and associated communications, so you should be comfortable collaborating with others with different backgrounds, job descriptions, and skill sets.<br><br>We are eager to consider all qualified applicants regardless of color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital or family status, disability, gender identity or expression, veteran status, actual or presumed belonging to an ethnic group, or any other legally protected status. If you have a disability or special need that requires accommodation, please let us know.<br><br>In this role, you would have the option to work remotely from a US time zone, or from our office in Boston. We’ll discuss other flexible arrangements as well, let us know what you need.<br><br><strong>About our team</strong><br><br>We’re just getting started, but here’s the goal. We’d like to build a product development team passionate about making a difference to others, with relevant software that helps people. Here’s a team assessment that spoke to us: <a href='https://hackernoon.com/product-development-team-self-assessment-c3707f065069' rel='nofollow'>https://hackernoon.com/product-development-team-self-assessment-c3707f065069</a>Wouldn’t it be nice to score highly on those measures?<br><br>Our goal is that everyone on the team cares about users, cares about business context, cares about design, and cares about one another. We want to hire people who get along with others and care deeply about how their work will be used.<br><br>Our company aims for work-life harmony; we believe in doing good work, with urgency and pragmatism, but at a sustainable pace. We do not expect long hours, but we do strive to have an impact.<br><br><strong>How to apply</strong><br><br>Fill out the form below.

We make web applications, focusing on Progressive Web Apps. Our projects can last between several weeks and several months. Many of our client projects are “greenfield”, so you’ll have the opportunity to define the core concepts that will have impact throughout the application and be built upon as the product grows.</p><p>Our designers work with the most innovative clients in the industry, and provide design leadership in collaboration with DockYard’s Engineering team. Designers don’t code their own HTML/CSS, but a familiarity with how the web is built is a big plus.</p><p><strong>We are a fully distributed company, with the design team clustered around Boston. This is a 100% remote position as of now.&nbsp;</strong>Some availability to travel is expected.</p><p>Because designers start projects and communicate directly with clients and the rest of the team each day, we value writing and communication skills. We also help you develop these skills, and grow professionally in other ways: a conference / education budget, DockYard Friday projects, and internal training are all part of the deal.</p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>Work directly with clients</li><li>Gather project requirements from various stakeholders</li><li>Create visual assets to support product discovery: from rough sketches to user flows to wireframes</li><li>Create polished visual design layouts</li><li>Collaborate with HTML/CSS engineers to ensure quality and implementability</li></ul><p>If this working style interests you, we’d love to hear from you! Individual applications only, please: we do not work with recruiters and aren’t looking to outsource work.</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> DockYard Fridays! One day a week, we switch away from client work. Instead, we teach ourselves something new, work on internal projects, and experiment. We offer full health, vision &amp; dental benefits plus a 401K plan, send you to one industry conference each year, and hold regular company team-building activities.</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> To apply, please include:- your portfolio &amp; resume- why you’re interested in DockYard specifically- what you hope to do with your career in the next 3 years</p>",

We are a nonprofit organization with a mission to reduce the cost of&nbsp;design education&nbsp;around the world, and we do so by providing high-quality online UX design courses at an affordable membership fee. With tens of thousands of members learning from our courses, and hundreds of thousands reading our free educational materials, we’re one of the largest UX design communities around the world.</p><p>We’ve spent the last 15 years building our community, and the last year rebuilding our course platform—based on a brilliant technology stack. And now we want&nbsp;you&nbsp;to help us build pure awesomeness in versions 7, 8, 9, etc.! If you’re a senior front-end developer with sublime programming skills acquired from 5+ years of experience, we’d like to work with you.</p><p>This is a paid&nbsp;full-time&nbsp;position. You’ll be&nbsp;location independent&nbsp;and will therefore be free to work from wherever you want in the world. You will have regular video-based contact with your colleagues and will get to meet them physically on team trips (see below).</p><h3>Why you’ll want to join us:</h3><ul><li>You get to work in an international team where we truly and deeply care about great architecture, great code, great documentation, great tests, etc.</li>    <li>We love our codebase and that’s why we have zero tolerance for spaghetti code and <a href='https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html' rel='nofollow'>technical debt</a>. Code should be so well-crafted that you want to kiss the screen. </li>    <li>You will have uninterrupted concentration time every day to build pure front-end awesomeness and thus accelerate your learning curve. If you were to work at Facebook or Google, you would be <a href='https://qz.com/806583/programmers-hate-open-floor-plans/' rel='nofollow'>constantly interrupted</a> and only have 2 hours of uninterrupted “flow time” per day. That creates a <a href='https://blog.ninlabs.com/2013/01/programmer-interrupted/' rel='nofollow'>slow learning curve</a>. Working with us, you get a full 7 hours per day. Imagine what that will do to your mental muscles, to your learning and to your career.</li>    <li>You will help shape the future of design education which millions of people can benefit from.</li>    <li>You will work with the best developers and designers in the world. And learn from them.</li>    <li>You will have the ability to work from anywhere — as long as your internet connection allows you to have video-based contact with your colleagues every day.</li>    <li>You get to work with true perfectionists! The development team is a small, senior, and highly-powered team of 7 people: 4 developers, a visual/UX designer, a software tester/QA, and a product owner. They also get input/help from an additional 4 people – as well as from our community of tens of thousands of designers and front-enders who love to provide feedback. You can learn enormous amounts. </li>    <li>You get to meet up with the rest of the team several times a year at interesting destinations like a scenic Thai island, Dubai, Denmark, or the like. See <a href='https://www.interaction-design.org/careers/' rel='nofollow'>the video about our company culture</a> for more.</li>    <li>We have a focus on evergreen programming techniques and best practices, as opposed to the latest hyped framework. We’d rather hand-craft things ourselves than build our platform on a gazillion 3<sup>rd</sup> party libraries. Just ask Facebook: <a href='https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/' rel='nofollow'>they know it sucks</a>. </li>    <li>Our <span>CEO</span> is a programmer and you will therefore not have to worry about “management speak” in order to get your point across. Just let your awesome code “speak for itself” and you will earn respect immediately!</li></ul><h3>What you will be doing:</h3><ul><li>You will take ownership and leadership of an ever-growing front end codebase where elegance and simplicity must be maintained and furthered – and where the evil forces <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy' rel='nofollow'>entropy</a>, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat' rel='nofollow'>bloat</a>, and spaghetti must be fought back by your intellect and coding skills.</li>    <li>Helping us to build an online course that will teach millions of designers how to become front-end developers. This will hugely improve your skills and ability to communicate – and will prove to be an awesome challenge!</li>    <li>Helping us to build an online course for our members on the topic of Design Systems – bringing Front End Development together with UI/UX Design.</li>    <li>Creating animations that are not only beautiful, but meaningful and are features that add to the UX of our users.</li>    <li>Building upon our current front end style guide and coding guides, which let our back end developers use front end components with ease. You will build a “design system” that is extremely detailed yet also easy to navigate and use…. much like <a href='https://polaris.shopify.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://polaris.shopify.com/</a></li></ul><h3>About you:</h3><ul><li>You love to learn and push your skills to new levels.</li>    <li>You have 5+ years of experience working professionally with OO + <span>MVC</span> (preferably web technologies).</li>    <li>You have an understanding of basic programming patterns and principles as well as a strong sense of good engineering and architecture.</li>    <li>You want to help us take our educational platform to the next level with front-end awesomeness: Animations, interactivity, social features, data-driven design, a better mobile version, “little big details”, and much more.</li>    <li>You want to help build a rock-solid and perfectly architected and documented front-end codebase.</li>    <li>You are truly ambitious, result-oriented, friendly, and you like to continually improve.</li>    <li>You are self-motivated and love to see tangible results.</li>    <li>You speak and write acceptable English – not perfect English, just acceptable – since you will be working with people from Turkey, England, Denmark, Russia and Brazil, among others.</li>    <li>It’s a plus if you have an experience with Typescript/Flow, any JS framework, and/or <a href='https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/' rel='nofollow'><span>PWA</span></a>.</li>    <li>It’s a big plus if you have contributed to open source.</li>    <li>It’s a big plus if you have worked professionally with at least one statically typed programming language like C, C++, Java, etc.</li></ul><h3>About the technology stack:</h3><p>We believe we have an awesome technology stack and a great (and agile) development process to back that up (Scrum). You don’t have to be an expert in all of these things. The most important things are your programming skills and extensive experience from other projects.</p><p>The technology stack is currently:</p><ul><li>Modern JS stack: ES6, Babel, JS modules, module bundling.</li>    <li><a href='http://getbem.com/introduction/' rel='nofollow'><span>BEM</span></a>/<span>ITCSS</span> as our <span>CSS</span> methodology for modular, reusable, and very well structured code.</li>    <li>We support only modern browsers (IE11+).</li>    <li>A clean separation between front-end and back-end code.</li>    <li><span>PHP</span> 7.1 where we use all the newest language features like type declarations.</li>    <li>A framework which has an incredible community support. The name of the framework is not important since we are technology agnostic.</li>    <li>MySQL 5.7 configured for the highest performance; Redis for our caching needs.</li>    <li>One of the best content delivery networks with tons of delivery points all over the world for lightning fast pages.</li>    <li>Nginx with HTTP2 enabled – and thus the ability to architect your JS code more flexibly because of the architecture of the HTTP2 protocol</li>    <li>Git and <a href='https://github.com/' rel='nofollow'>GitHub</a> using <a href='https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html' rel='nofollow'>gitflow</a>.</li>    <li><a href='https://www.vagrantup.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vagrant</a> (with <a href='https://www.virtualbox.org/' rel='nofollow'>VirtualBox</a>) and seamless CI and deployment infrastructure.</li>    <li>…and well… lots more!</li></ul><h3>Want to join our team?
