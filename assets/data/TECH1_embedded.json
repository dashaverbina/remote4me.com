What's the process?</strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, we will reject your application immediately. If you do follow the directions in this job posting, and we like your resume, we will schedule an introductory interview with you. Additional interviews could occur if we feel you fit our company culture.</p><p><strong>What's with the dishes analogy?</strong></p><p>Doing your dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. Do your dishes.Do you see someone (including us, the Founders) making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p><strong>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</strong></p><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and code exercise.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Flexible Vacation                            </div>                            <div>                                 Work Remote                            </div>                    ",
