Our vision is to decentralize banking and bring the power of financial services to everyone in the world, including the nearly 2 billion adults that to this day remain unbanked.</p><p><strong>Embedded development at Bread</strong></p><p>Bread's origins trace back to the desire to build a beautiful product underpinned by beautiful software. Our mobile wallet connects directly to cryptocurrency peer to peer networks and as such has a unique set of requirements that differs from those that depend on a centralized server. To accomplish this task we've built a standalone C library which provides a full bitcoin SPV wallet. Aaron Voisine, the author of the library, has painstakingly crafted this library so it can be used in both our iOS and Android wallets.</p><p>This codebase is responsible for providing access to billions of dollars in assets on customers wallets. It's paramount that we continue to maintain and evolve the library to meet our business and our customer needs. This includes adding support for more cryptocurrencies, and building a testing infrastructure so we can automatically verify correctness.</p><p><strong>What we're doing at Bread</strong></p><p>Bread is at the heart of a financial revolution. We're building the missing piece of infrastructure that ties together the essential functionality of a bank, but where individuals retain complete control over their assets. As a a financial infrastructure company, our mission is unlikely to ever be complete. We need continually strive to bring the power of our apps to new regions of the world, some of which have never had wide access to banking functionality.</p><p>Our approach to this problem heavily focuses on several core tenants. For one, we will never have direct control or visibility over customer funds. It is not our job to interfere in the personal financial lives of our customers. This is accomplished by using digital assets like Bitcoin, and a mobile app like ours which manages its assets on-device.</p><p>The second tenant of our approach is to provide integration with the traditional financial system. Regardless of the currency, people still need to get paid, pay their bills, pay for goods at merchants, and send money to their family and friends. We are building infrastructure that integrates with local financial businesses that tie in with local currencies and adhere to local laws.</p><p>Finally, we need to fight for a quality consumer experience. This is why we try to retain control over every moment of our customer's interaction with our products. We relentlessly design, redesign, test, and experiment to ensure our customers have a positive, safe experience.</p><p><strong>What it's like to work here</strong></p><p>We've built a lively remote work culture that emphasizes regular personal interaction. At Bread, we started as a remote team and have built our workflows around it.

The ideal candidate is an “engineer's engineer&quot; and enjoys reading about engineering in their free time, tinkering on the weekends with side projects and staying abreast of the latest technologies in their area of expertise. We want someone with a passion for engineering.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Develop the embedded systems and firmware for hardware designs and bring them to market</li><li>Support product requirements, definition, design, optimization, validation and release processes</li><li>Work with a team to develop and release products in release cycles</li><li>Optimize power consumption</li><li>Self-manage and track development activities from a remote location</li><li>Draft diagnostic requirements for design verification and mass production testing</li><li>Structural Mechanical Design</li></ul><p><strong>Required Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>Embedded Systems - Experience Advanced</li><li>Firmware Design - Experience Advanced</li><li>Analog/Digital Circuit Design - Experience Advanced</li><li>Low Power Design - Experience Advanced</li><li>Bluetooth Wireless Communication - Experience Advanced</li><li>Composite and Metal Manufacturing</li></ul><p><strong>Optional Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>Object-Oriented Programming - Java, C#, Objective C, C++, Python, PHP</li><li>iOS and/or Android Development</li><li>GIT for Source Control</li></ul><p><strong>Work Remote</strong></p><p>We're looking for the best candidate we can find.

If you are a racer or FLO Cycling user, let us know!</p><p><strong>What's unlimited vacation mean?</strong></p><p>We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><p>Employees shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no e-mail checking) but some take more, and some take less. The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out.</p><p>If however, you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><p><strong>Tools for the Job?</strong></p><p>Developers get the latest tricked-out MacBook Pro and a monitor.</p><p><strong>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</strong></p><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate engineers are self-taught.</p><p><strong>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, we will reject your application immediately. If you do follow the directions in this job posting, and we like your resume, we will schedule an introductory interview with you. Additional interviews could occur if we feel you fit our company culture.</p><p><strong>What's with the dishes analogy?</strong></p><p>Doing your dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. Do your dishes.Do you see someone (including us, the Founders) making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p><strong>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</strong></p><p>Right now!
