Familiarity with the nuances of Hugo will be helpful.</li><li>Past success as a Technical Writer is an advantage. That said, a diverse skill set as shown by your past roles and open source contributions is more important. Experience in Testing/QA, Customer Success, Product Management or Marketing is a plus.</li><li>You enjoy writing about technical products, including server software and REST APIs, and easily translate technical concepts into content accessible to the uninitiated.</li><li>Willing to occasionally travel in order to conduct user and subject matter expert interviews.</li><li>Excellent spoken and written English.</li><li>Committed to work in accordance with our Code of Conduct.</li></ul><h5>Benefits</h5><ul><li><strong>Competitive and transparent salary,</strong> $120,000 per year.</li><li><strong>Equity!</strong> Every member of Team Sensu receives equity in Sensu, Inc.

I hired Mohamed, Laravel’s first employee, over a year ago. Mohamed has done a fantastic job improving many aspects of the Laravel ecosystem. However, I think Laravel could benefit from a third employee.</p><p>While I focus on general ecosystem direction and core framework features, Mohamed will primarily focus on development and maintenance on Laravel’s commercial offerings. So, I believe Laravel could benefit from someone dedicated to assisting with the open-source portion of the ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Open Source &amp; Community Liaison</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Manage GitHub issues across all of Laravel’s open-source repositories, as well as the “laravel/internals” repository. Issue reports will need to be either closed, triaged as something that requires my attention, or fixed.</p><p>Ideally, you will be able to fix general bugs in the framework that are reported through GitHub, so a thorough knowledge of Laravel is preferred. For larger issues that arise, bug fixing will be a team effort between you, Mohamed, and myself.</p><p>In addition to bug fixing and issue management, you may sometimes experiment with prototyping new features for the framework.</p><p>Finally, you are encouraged to stick around various Laravel community channels such as the Laracasts forums, LaraChat Slack, and Laravel.io. This will help us identify common problems Laravel developers are having and improve the overall developer experience of the framework.</p><p><strong><em>Remote developers from around the world are encouraged to apply!</em></strong></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

    "content": "DESCRIPTION<br /><br />You’re a Digital content producer who has an enticing way with words and a strong appetite for technology; and you’re looking for a new job. But, not any job. You want a job that empowers you to unleash your creativity, where you are seen as an individual and supported by an equally passionate team.<br /><br />A role at GrantTree might be exactly what you’ve been looking for.<br /><br />GrantTree was founded 7 years ago and employs 33 people. In our self-managing culture everyone has the freedom, power and trust to do great work. We call this open culture. It’s been successful for us so far, but we also know it's not for everyone (we suggest you check out our GlassDoor reviews). This is the ideal environment for creative, independent people who are open to developing through challenging work.<br /><br />GrantTree’s Marketing team is…<br /><br />Strategic<br />Creative<br />High-performing<br /><br />We've just started to expand our Marketing team and now we’re searching for an additional team member to add richness to our channels through writing content, video production and graphic design.<br /><br />Could you be this missing person?<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />- You are a professional copywriter at core, with experience of independently crafting blog content (within the finance space is a plus).<br /><br />- You must be passionate and knowledgeable about software, apps and tech. You know how to use the relevant tools to produce supporting quality media assets quickly, an illustration, an infographic or a short animated video of your creation.<br /><br />- You're confident at reviewing existing content and making executive decisions on how to make it better.<br /><br />- You are strategic with a sound understanding of your audience and how to best engage them with the right tone of voice.<br /><br />- You have the ability to build a content strategy and execute it, with an acute attention to detail and performance.<br /><br />- You enjoy developing editorial guidelines to ensure consistently good writing.<br /><br />We anticipate that the focus of this role will be around 65% writing and 35% media production. We don't need you to be a full-fledged graphic designer or a videographer, but we expect you to be one of those content producers who use graphic design and video tools to support their content. A deep understanding of how to engage the audience and support core messages is key.<br /><br />We are looking for someone who will thrive from coordinating their own workload and having free reign to develop content using their expertise. You will also work with the marketing team who can help support you with Strategy, Social Media, SEO and PPC.<br /><br />In addition to all this, our environment offers the freedom to seriously grow, professionally and personally, helping you gain well-rounded skills to be phenomenal at this role.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />We believe that people should be rewarded fairly for the work they do. At GrantTree there is no secrecy over salaries and the way we work them out. For this role, this is likely to lie between £25k and £35k depending on experience. We also provide access to health insurance, cycle to work, and an annual discretionary bonus.<br /><br />Aside from money, we offer a place where you can be yourself. We want you to develop your skills and fulfil your potential. We have a flexible approach to working, and some of our staff work remotely most of the time. Our office near Old Street is bright and airy, with a fab roof terrace. You can take up to 6 weeks as holiday each year.<br /><br />Equal Opportunities<br /><br />Teams are stronger when they have a diverse range of people. Applications are accepted from everyone, regardless of the categories they put themselves in. We also encourage talented ‘square pegs’, who don’t neatly fit into the person specification, to apply.<br />",
