As a Principal Technical Writer, your focus will be on the leading a thoughtful taxonomy of documentation across our products with an emphasis on reducing the friction of new participants becoming regular contributors within our guidelines. You will have the time and budget to experiment on ways to improve our documentation. You will also have teammates who know the product (Success Engineers and Developer Advocate), manage our content (Marketing Content Strategist) and write new feature documentation (Engineering) so you have room to do what you do best. </p><h5>Responsibilities</h5><ul><li>Teach others to write great documentation. Shepherd everything from product features coming out of our engineering team to new community contributors looking to fix that command-line argument they found inaccurate.</li><li>Champion a taxonomy that works for new and advanced users alike. Design a system, within the technical limitations of our tooling, that makes sense now and for the future.</li><li>Drive documentation as a product, being accountable for not only its content but also its roadmap, presentation, navigation, analytics and SEO alongside peers focused on Marketing Analytics. Lead in the definition of needed guides and any education to communicate your craft. </li><li>Design practices that lead to a consistent use of Sensu’s tone, which is defined as “community-driven, informed, informal.” </li><li>Continually improve documentation through direct feedback-gathering and experimentation. </li></ul><h5>About You</h5><p>Our ideal candidate will meet the required experience and most of the following qualifications: </p><ul><li>[Required] Expertise in Open Source documentation.

You can point to experiences writing documentation, style guides, or similar work for an audience related to ours (SREs, DevOps engineers, system administrators or developers).</li><li>Experience wrangling web technologies in order to build beautiful documentation (HTML, CSS and JavaScript in particular). Familiarity with the nuances of Hugo will be helpful.</li><li>Past success as a Technical Writer is an advantage. That said, a diverse skill set as shown by your past roles and open source contributions is more important. Experience in Testing/QA, Customer Success, Product Management or Marketing is a plus.</li><li>You enjoy writing about technical products, including server software and REST APIs, and easily translate technical concepts into content accessible to the uninitiated.</li><li>Willing to occasionally travel in order to conduct user and subject matter expert interviews.</li><li>Excellent spoken and written English.</li><li>Committed to work in accordance with our Code of Conduct.</li></ul><h5>Benefits</h5><ul><li><strong>Competitive and transparent salary,</strong> $120,000 per year.</li><li><strong>Equity!</strong> Every member of Team Sensu receives equity in Sensu, Inc. (in the form of common stock options).</li><li><strong>Work from anywhere in the United States or Canada!</strong> We are a distributed team with flexible working hours and no central office location.</li><li><strong>4-week minimum vacation policy,</strong> only used for full days off (20 days of PTO per year). Employees with unused vacation at the end of the year will have their access to company resources disabled until the new year (e.g. email, Slack, GitHub, etc), corresponding to their balance of unused PTO! If you manage to exhaust your PTO, additional PTO will be granted depending on impact to team objectives.</li><li><strong>Company paid holidays,</strong> based on the US Federal holiday schedule of 10 days per year (may be exchanged for alternate dates, e.g. personal days).</li><li><strong>Company provided health care</strong> for employees located in the United States (includes medical, dental, and vision coverage).

Individual career growth opportunities abound. Looking to level up some technical ability, advance your leadership skills, or continue some education? Whether you're beginning your career or mastering your craft, Sensu will help you get to the next level of you. </p><h5>Equal Opportunity Employer</h5><p>Sensu does not discriminate on the basis of race, sex, color, religion, age, national origin, marital status, disability, veteran status, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other reason prohibited by law (or human decency) in provision of employment opportunities and benefits.</p><p>Furthermore, we believe that homogeneous teams are not only boring, but also disadvantaged due to a lack of diversity (of vantage points, etc). We foster a welcoming environment for everyone and we would love for you to be part of it.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere*</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>Work from anywhere in the United States or Canada!</p></dd>        </dl>",

I hired Mohamed, Laravel’s first employee, over a year ago. Mohamed has done a fantastic job improving many aspects of the Laravel ecosystem. However, I think Laravel could benefit from a third employee.</p><p>While I focus on general ecosystem direction and core framework features, Mohamed will primarily focus on development and maintenance on Laravel’s commercial offerings. So, I believe Laravel could benefit from someone dedicated to assisting with the open-source portion of the ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Open Source &amp; Community Liaison</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Manage GitHub issues across all of Laravel’s open-source repositories, as well as the “laravel/internals” repository. Issue reports will need to be either closed, triaged as something that requires my attention, or fixed.</p><p>Ideally, you will be able to fix general bugs in the framework that are reported through GitHub, so a thorough knowledge of Laravel is preferred. For larger issues that arise, bug fixing will be a team effort between you, Mohamed, and myself.</p><p>In addition to bug fixing and issue management, you may sometimes experiment with prototyping new features for the framework.</p><p>Finally, you are encouraged to stick around various Laravel community channels such as the Laracasts forums, LaraChat Slack, and Laravel.io. This will help us identify common problems Laravel developers are having and improve the overall developer experience of the framework.</p><p><strong><em>Remote developers from around the world are encouraged to apply!</em></strong></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",
