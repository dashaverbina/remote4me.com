I hired Mohamed, Laravel’s first employee, over a year ago. Mohamed has done a fantastic job improving many aspects of the Laravel ecosystem. However, I think Laravel could benefit from a third employee.</p><p>While I focus on general ecosystem direction and core framework features, Mohamed will primarily focus on development and maintenance on Laravel’s commercial offerings. So, I believe Laravel could benefit from someone dedicated to assisting with the open-source portion of the ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Open Source &amp; Community Liaison</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Manage GitHub issues across all of Laravel’s open-source repositories, as well as the “laravel/internals” repository. Issue reports will need to be either closed, triaged as something that requires my attention, or fixed.</p><p>Ideally, you will be able to fix general bugs in the framework that are reported through GitHub, so a thorough knowledge of Laravel is preferred. For larger issues that arise, bug fixing will be a team effort between you, Mohamed, and myself.</p><p>In addition to bug fixing and issue management, you may sometimes experiment with prototyping new features for the framework.</p><p>Finally, you are encouraged to stick around various Laravel community channels such as the Laracasts forums, LaraChat Slack, and Laravel.io. This will help us identify common problems Laravel developers are having and improve the overall developer experience of the framework.</p><p><strong><em>Remote developers from around the world are encouraged to apply!</em></strong></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

    "content": "DESCRIPTION<br /><br />You’re a Digital content producer who has an enticing way with words and a strong appetite for technology; and you’re looking for a new job. But, not any job. You want a job that empowers you to unleash your creativity, where you are seen as an individual and supported by an equally passionate team.<br /><br />A role at GrantTree might be exactly what you’ve been looking for.<br /><br />GrantTree was founded 7 years ago and employs 33 people. In our self-managing culture everyone has the freedom, power and trust to do great work. We call this open culture. It’s been successful for us so far, but we also know it's not for everyone (we suggest you check out our GlassDoor reviews). This is the ideal environment for creative, independent people who are open to developing through challenging work.<br /><br />GrantTree’s Marketing team is…<br /><br />Strategic<br />Creative<br />High-performing<br /><br />We've just started to expand our Marketing team and now we’re searching for an additional team member to add richness to our channels through writing content, video production and graphic design.<br /><br />Could you be this missing person?<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />- You are a professional copywriter at core, with experience of independently crafting blog content (within the finance space is a plus).<br /><br />- You must be passionate and knowledgeable about software, apps and tech. You know how to use the relevant tools to produce supporting quality media assets quickly, an illustration, an infographic or a short animated video of your creation.<br /><br />- You're confident at reviewing existing content and making executive decisions on how to make it better.<br /><br />- You are strategic with a sound understanding of your audience and how to best engage them with the right tone of voice.<br /><br />- You have the ability to build a content strategy and execute it, with an acute attention to detail and performance.<br /><br />- You enjoy developing editorial guidelines to ensure consistently good writing.<br /><br />We anticipate that the focus of this role will be around 65% writing and 35% media production. We don't need you to be a full-fledged graphic designer or a videographer, but we expect you to be one of those content producers who use graphic design and video tools to support their content. A deep understanding of how to engage the audience and support core messages is key.<br /><br />We are looking for someone who will thrive from coordinating their own workload and having free reign to develop content using their expertise. You will also work with the marketing team who can help support you with Strategy, Social Media, SEO and PPC.<br /><br />In addition to all this, our environment offers the freedom to seriously grow, professionally and personally, helping you gain well-rounded skills to be phenomenal at this role.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />We believe that people should be rewarded fairly for the work they do. At GrantTree there is no secrecy over salaries and the way we work them out. For this role, this is likely to lie between £25k and £35k depending on experience. We also provide access to health insurance, cycle to work, and an annual discretionary bonus.<br /><br />Aside from money, we offer a place where you can be yourself. We want you to develop your skills and fulfil your potential. We have a flexible approach to working, and some of our staff work remotely most of the time. Our office near Old Street is bright and airy, with a fab roof terrace. You can take up to 6 weeks as holiday each year.<br /><br />Equal Opportunities<br /><br />Teams are stronger when they have a diverse range of people. Applications are accepted from everyone, regardless of the categories they put themselves in. We also encourage talented ‘square pegs’, who don’t neatly fit into the person specification, to apply.<br />",

Academy is focused on developing the global ethereum talent base, both technical and non-technical, by creating and delivering packaged content across a variety of channels, including published, online, virtual and in-person. Our audiences include business users, technology developers, legal/compliance/regulatory personnel, professors/teachers, and the general public. We would also like to enable and expand the overall blockchain community by training and certifying other trainers across a variety of communities. We’re looking to build a global, cross-functional interdisciplinary team of “master trainers”: experts and leaders to serve as in-person and virtual instructors to customers, partners and other members of the ConsenSys organization.</p><p>Training courses and programs will cover Blockchain and Ethereum technology, applications and use cases, plus material on ConsenSys products. Training delivery may be conducted in a variety of places including traditional training spaces, remote office locations, client office locations, plus industry conferences and events, so travel (~30-50%) will be required as a normal part of all training roles.</p><p>The successful candidate will have either significant experience delivering highly technical training content to a variety of audiences, or the interest in doing so combined with established technical abilities in ethereum, blockchain, or an adjacent space such as big data or enterprise software. You must have a high energy, service-oriented, friendly, professional disposition. </p><p>The ideal candidate will be an excellent speaker and be able to evangelize the use for Blockchain by representing ConsenSys as a speaker at key industry events, conferences, guest lectures, and so on. You’re a quick technical study, you love learning for learning’s sake, and you always build your expertise as you go. When you’re not actively teaching courses in person and participating in community activities, you’ll be contributing to our online offering as mentors, actively working on internal enablement within ConsenSys, and helping us to improve our education processes.</p><p>You may be asked to interact with our sales/business development teams to help determine a customer’s training needs. This may require your involvement in the sales process to assist with identifying the client’s true training needs and helping to determine a plan to meet them. You might also help manage the overall global training schedule, which may include providing back-up capacity to your training colleagues in other offices or regions.</p><p>You will be responsible for partnering with Academy content specialists to develop or update training materials, and ensure that you understand the newest content. This may include collecting and providing feedback on what is/is not working in how the content is structured or explained in the courses or programs.</p><p>Your Qualifications:<br>-Bachelor’s degree required, preferably in computer science or related field<br>Either:<br>       -3-5+ years of technical software training experience working with a <br>       variety of audiences<br>       -Demonstrably strong presentation/demonstration skills via other <br>        customer-facing technical roles such as software developer, supporter, <br>        sales engineer, consultant, or similar.<br>-Must have excellent verbal and written skills being able to communicate effectively on both a technical and business level to a diverse, mostly remote team<br>-Entrepreneurial spirit with track record for successfully delivering measurable results in fast-moving environments<br>-Ability to understand complex technical concepts and explain them to non-technical trainees<br>-References who can vouch for your capability to maintain credibility with senior technical staff and executives alike<br>-Flexibility to adapt to changing markets, customers and our non-conventional organization.

We received lots of responses: most very sensible, many very insightful, some quite unexpected and a few deliberately tongue-in-cheek.</p><p>The most important thing to note when thinking about work-life balance is that it is different for everyone. While there may a perfect solution for an individual in any given time, place and work situation, it is almost certain to be different for another individual – by a degree that can be tiny or enormous.</p><p>What we’re looking for, then, is not a single way of approaching work-life balance but suggestions from the community as to what works for them. You may well pick up a tip or two that positively affect your own work-life balance, and <strong>your suggestion might help someone else out</strong>.</p><div><h5>Productivity Tips And Tricks</h5><p>How's your year going so far? Are you as productive as you were hoping to be? Folks from the community also shared their best productivity tips — perhaps there's one you'd like to try to help yourself keep your New Year's Resolution? <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/community-productivity-tips-tricks/' rel='nofollow'>Read a related article →</a></p></div><p>There are overall themes and lines of thinking that emerge in our community responses, and we’ll organize them into groups for this article.  I’ll also add some thoughts of my own to these, as I live and work in a situation that allows me to often do what is least recommended – but it works brilliantly for me.</p><p>Let’s work our way from the simplest and easiest to implement to the more complex and potentially challenging suggestions.</p><h4>Control Your Devices</h4><p>A large group of folks focused on managing devices and hardware. This makes a lot of sense. In some ways, we are fortunate to work in an industry where we not only have some truly remarkable hardware and software at our disposal – digital tools of immense power – but we can to some extent control these tools to behave in ways we’d like them to. For some, the key to a good balance between work and life lies in exercising that control.</p>      <div>      <div>        <p>          Is your pattern library up to date today? <em>Alla Kholmatova</em> has just finished a fully fledged book on <strong>Design Systems</strong> and how to get them right.

If a client website is down, I need to fix it — pronto. If a client has a question or a task for me, I want to know what that task is ASAP. For that reason, I tend to keep my devices on – although typically silent – while I’m awake and my software configured to alert me to any notifications.</p>  <div></div><p>The thing is, in my situation, notifications simply allow me to decide whether to complete a task and when. If I get a text message or an email while I’m watching TV with the kids, I’ll look at it and decide whether I need to respond immediately. Ninety-nine times out of 100, it can wait. But I want to know, in case that one time in a hundred is critical and requires immediate action. Note that my clients pay a premium for this service and it’s easy for me to do.</p><h4>Commit To Non-Work Activities</h4><p>A different group of tips (although, as you will have noticed, there’s quite a bit of overlap between these groups) focused on making specific time for non-work activities.</p><p>The key here seems to be to make a commitment. We all have things we like to do that help us wind down, but we often let the time for that slide by while we’re busy getting work done: staying longer at the office, completing work tasks at home, and working over the weekend.</p><p>The activities themselves are varied and obviously should reflect your personal interests. Community suggestions included games, hobbies, physical exercise, meditation, children, pets and more. The main point is that they are not, by any definition, work.</p><table>    <thead>    <tr>        <th>Tip</th>        <th></th>    </tr></thead><tbody>    <tr>        <td>“I am bad at this, but I have (mostly) managed to reserve Thursday night as games night for Dungeons and Dragons/board games.

Having two teenage children helps, requiring varying levels of direct and indirect participation in a range of sporting and cultural events, but I also play some sport myself and have a couple of other structured, social leisure activities, as well as random family board games, movie nights and outings. I also have a dog, a Border Collie, and I completely agree with Erin Weigel.</p><h4>Manage Your Time</h4><p>Allowing, again, for overlaps, there was a distinct group of tips that focused on how we divide and use our time, on an hourly, daily, weekly or longer basis. They acknowledge that the clock doesn’t have to rule our lives but can be a good tool for achieving balance.</p><table>    <thead>    <tr>        <th>Tip</th>        <th></th>    </tr></thead><tbody>    <tr>        <td>“Don't do any work stuff before you get to the office.

Bradshaw</a></td>    </tr></tbody></table><p><strong>My Take</strong>: This is where my experience defies all or most of the tips and suggestions offered. I work from home as a freelancer, a web designer, developer, writer. My wife is a writer and editor who also works from home. We have two high school teenagers at home, and we live 100 miles or so south of the big city of Sydney, Australia. My day is a jigsaw puzzle of work tasks and home tasks, following no real schedule other than doing what needs to be done, whether it’s a client job or a household chore, each often to a non-negotiable timetable. I juggle work tasks and home tasks interchangeably. Frankly, they are just all tasks to me. Some, I get paid for. Some keep my family housed, fed, clothed, educated and entertained. It all has to be done, and it all gets done.</p><p>I must acknowledge that I have specific advantages. Having done this for over 20 years, I have put together a reliable, secure home office with all the tools I need to work. I live in a house big enough to accommodate two people working without tripping over each other. 90% of my work is done remotely (the exception being face-to-face meetings with clients), and I deliberately seek out and take such work. I’m also fortunate that I genuinely and absolutely love what I do, and how I get to do it. I doubt that I will or even could hold down a regular job again.</p><p>I do also believe that my situation is becoming increasingly common and increasingly viable for many people. A lot of those people may well find setting clear divisions between home and work tasks is beneficial, or even necessary. Others may find an approach similar to the one I use is more effective. It all depends.</p><h4>Change Your Thinking</h4><p>Some people offered suggestions aimed at changing the way we think about work and lowering its priority in our lives. We’re getting into the bigger picture here and, perhaps as a consequence, some of these tips will only work for some people – but they might all help you to reflect on your own situation.</p><table>    <thead>    <tr>        <th>Tip</th>        <th></th>    </tr></thead><tbody>    <tr>        <td>“Start by calling it life-work balance to emphasise where your priority is.”</td>        <td><a href='https://twitter.com/@davidjbradshaw' rel='nofollow'>David J.

I developed strategies and techniques that inevitably affected my work-life balance. I’m now very comfortable living a life defined not by what is work and what isn’t, but simply by what needs to be done at any given time.</p><h4>Over To You</h4><p>Quite a few people gave us lists that included several of the individual points made by others (you can read more of these posts on <a href='https://twitter.com/smashingmag/status/943058872473935872' rel='nofollow'>Twitter</a> and SmashingMag’s <a href='https://www.facebook.com/smashmag/posts/10156027292532490' rel='nofollow'>Facebook</a> page).
