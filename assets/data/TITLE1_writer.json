Can you help?</p><p><span>Be the champion&nbsp;for content on a growing team</span></p><p>Do you get excited thinking about establishing tone and voice guidelines for products and teams?

We’re always looking for ways to improve how we share information with customers.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Be incredibly comfortable with technology and communicating with developers</span></p><p>Since virtually all of our customers are developers, it’s critical that all of our content focuses on the needs and interests of developers. Generally speaking, that means we’re laser-focused on substance over filler or fluff.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’re mindful of quantitative things like metrics and SEO, but we don’t believe that should drive our content strategy. It can play a role informing the strategy, but it’s not our guiding light.</p><p><span>Do a little bit of everything as we grow</span></p><p>A typical day could involve writing or editing content for the blog or our newsletter. Or you might review analytics or SEO tools to see what we’re doing right&nbsp;(or wrong).
