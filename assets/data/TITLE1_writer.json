Can you help?</p><p><span>Be the champion&nbsp;for content on a growing team</span></p><p>Do you get excited thinking about establishing tone and voice guidelines for products and teams? Does writing and editing blog posts and guides to help customers sound like fun? Do you enjoy writing marketing copy and crafting the story for landing pages?

Our marketing and customer success team work hand-in-hand to make that happen.

We’re always looking for ways to improve how we share information with customers.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Be incredibly comfortable with technology and communicating with developers</span></p><p>Since virtually all of our customers are developers, it’s critical that all of our content focuses on the needs and interests of developers. Generally speaking, that means we’re laser-focused on substance over filler or fluff.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’re mindful of quantitative things like metrics and SEO, but we don’t believe that should drive our content strategy. It can play a role informing the strategy, but it’s not our guiding light.</p><p><span>Do a little bit of everything as we grow</span></p><p>A typical day could involve writing or editing content for the blog or our newsletter. Or you might review analytics or SEO tools to see what we’re doing right&nbsp;(or wrong). Maybe you’ll be producing a new blog post in our CMS&nbsp;(Craft) or planning our upcoming month’s editorial and social media content promotion. Or maybe you’re heads down crafting that just-right marketing copy for an upcoming feature announcement. You could even help us improve our journey towards more video content.</p><p><span>Be a part of a team with a healthy and supportive approach to work</span></p><p>If you love words and have a passion for using technology to communicate, we’d love to talk. Wildbit is remote-friendly and family-friendly with quarterly profit sharing and yearly team retreats to great locations. If you’re in Philly, we even have chef-prepared family-style lunches at the office every day. It may sound corny and difficult to believe, but we really do operate like a family and do our best to support each other and help each other grow in a healthy team environment.</p><p><strong><span><span>Wildbit is an equal opportunity employer and proud of it.</span></span></strong></p><p>We’re committed to building a diverse team, and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.
