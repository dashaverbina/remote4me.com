As a Principal Technical Writer, your focus will be on the leading a thoughtful taxonomy of documentation across our products with an emphasis on reducing the friction of new participants becoming regular contributors within our guidelines. You will have the time and budget to experiment on ways to improve our documentation. You will also have teammates who know the product (Success Engineers and Developer Advocate), manage our content (Marketing Content Strategist) and write new feature documentation (Engineering) so you have room to do what you do best. </p><h5>Responsibilities</h5><ul><li>Teach others to write great documentation. Shepherd everything from product features coming out of our engineering team to new community contributors looking to fix that command-line argument they found inaccurate.</li><li>Champion a taxonomy that works for new and advanced users alike.

Familiarity with the nuances of Hugo will be helpful.</li><li>Past success as a Technical Writer is an advantage. That said, a diverse skill set as shown by your past roles and open source contributions is more important. Experience in Testing/QA, Customer Success, Product Management or Marketing is a plus.</li><li>You enjoy writing about technical products, including server software and REST APIs, and easily translate technical concepts into content accessible to the uninitiated.</li><li>Willing to occasionally travel in order to conduct user and subject matter expert interviews.</li><li>Excellent spoken and written English.</li><li>Committed to work in accordance with our Code of Conduct.</li></ul><h5>Benefits</h5><ul><li><strong>Competitive and transparent salary,</strong> $120,000 per year.</li><li><strong>Equity!</strong> Every member of Team Sensu receives equity in Sensu, Inc.

I hired Mohamed, Laravel’s first employee, over a year ago. Mohamed has done a fantastic job improving many aspects of the Laravel ecosystem. However, I think Laravel could benefit from a third employee.</p><p>While I focus on general ecosystem direction and core framework features, Mohamed will primarily focus on development and maintenance on Laravel’s commercial offerings. So, I believe Laravel could benefit from someone dedicated to assisting with the open-source portion of the ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Title:</strong> Open Source &amp; Community Liaison</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Manage GitHub issues across all of Laravel’s open-source repositories, as well as the “laravel/internals” repository. Issue reports will need to be either closed, triaged as something that requires my attention, or fixed.</p><p>Ideally, you will be able to fix general bugs in the framework that are reported through GitHub, so a thorough knowledge of Laravel is preferred. For larger issues that arise, bug fixing will be a team effort between you, Mohamed, and myself.</p><p>In addition to bug fixing and issue management, you may sometimes experiment with prototyping new features for the framework.</p><p>Finally, you are encouraged to stick around various Laravel community channels such as the Laracasts forums, LaraChat Slack, and Laravel.io. This will help us identify common problems Laravel developers are having and improve the overall developer experience of the framework.</p><p><strong><em>Remote developers from around the world are encouraged to apply!</em></strong></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

We are innovating left and right and we do work that changes lives.</div><div><br></div><div>We work hard, get shit done and are insanely informal.</div><div><br></div><div>Don't believe me? What if we did a perfect lobster walk?</div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>BOOM. 10/10 Crustacean Shuffle.</span></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Anyway...
