You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75K-100K (Mid-Level) and $100-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates within a 3 hour drive of Louisville, KY are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

If you are easily lead into a “______ rocks, everything else sucks” mentality, this isn’t the job for you.</li><li><strong>Flexible</strong>: we are small, things change.

You will help develop pilots, projects and services for our customers, hosted on Linux using&nbsp;<em>Kubernetes</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Google Cloud Platform</em>. The majority of these projects are related to&nbsp;<em>artificial intelligence</em>,&nbsp;<em>machine learning</em>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<em>data science</em>, while some are related to&nbsp;<em>web crawling</em>.</p><p>You can take on and finish tasks with a large degree of independence. As we are still a small and growing company (eight developers per January 2018), you need to have a broad technical competence and be flexible about your projects.</p><p>Each project usually have two developers working as a mini-team, but we communicate about challenges with everyone. We need both people skilled in putting code into production and those who specialize in ML, but for us it is important that everyone can code. For this position the actual Python programming is the important part.&nbsp;You make us extra happy if you have data science experience, a strong AI/ML background and/or statistical knowledge, but this is not required.</p><p>Recently we have worked on projects including speech to text, video OCR, text based recommendation systems, price prediction, a customer support mail-bot and generally a lot of fun and open ended challenges with a high success rate.</p><p>We offer a large degree of freedom. Pick your own equipment, OS, IDE, etc. You can choose to work from home. We offer a bonus and pension program. You will be working in a pleasant environment with other highly skilled Python programmers and machine learning experts.</p><p>Our developers can currently choose to work from home up to three days a week. So far we have preferred to meet in person to discuss projects now and then, but we are interested in working with full time remote developers as well.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Tenfifty AB            </h2>            <div><p>We are all about putting cutting edge machine learning into production and real use for our clients.</p><p>As of January 2018 we are a growing team of eight developers who work on (mostly) machine learning projects. We specialize in doing customized AI and ML solutions, often based on our existing code platform, that go beyond the &quot;fun pilot&quot;-stage and deliver real value. Usually we do a pilot to determine quality and feasibility, followed by a main project where we put models, etc into production, offered as a subscription service.</p><p>Many&nbsp;of us have well over a decade of experience doing Python and machine learning in practice, with solid mathematical and programming background. We always try to stay on the cutting edge, hosting and attending ML-meetups and seminars, reading papers, etc. In our projects we balance new&nbsp;methods that are fun/important to learn with more mature methods that we know will work in practice.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Flexible hours                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible location                            </div>                            <div>                                 Stock options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Fitness and health program                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pension program                            </div>                            <div>                                 Expert colleagues                            </div>                    ",

We're looking for a full-stack engineer and a backend architect to join our 5-person founding team here in Boston, MA. At this time we aren't prepared to offer H1B/Visa sponsorship or remote work.</p><p>JOB DESCRIPTIONCurrently, we are working closely with our customers to rapidly prototype, build, and refine the Jellyfish platform. We are using a Django stack (Python 3, Django, Postgres) hosted on AWS, so experience with these technologies is a plus. We are also seeking to augment the team with someone with substantial experience with toolkits like scikit-learn.</p><p>ABOUT YOUIdeal candidates will have two or more years experience building software and a bachelor's degree in a computer-science-adjacent field. We will also consider equivalent experience in lieu of a degree. Familiarity with building and bringing software to market is a huge plus. As we are an early-stage startup there is the standard caveat: we're working quite hard to quickly bring this to market, so there will be a non-zero amount of unpredictability. The flip side of that is, of course, the opportunity to join an early-stage startup working on an interesting idea.</p><p>TECH STACK</p><p>Python (Django, NumPy), PostgreSQL, AWS, Nginx</p><p>COMPENSATION Competitive salary plus equity grant</p><p>Email resumes to jobs [at] jelly.ai or you can contact me directly asm [at] jelly.ai with questions.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",
