The platform is currently in use by over 130 customers, and security operations centers that are 24x7.</p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>We prefer candidates local to the Plano, TX area. We are open to the right candidate even if you are remote. If you are remote and believe you are the right person for the job - send us some code, change our mind!</p><p><strong>The Traits Our Backend Developers Have</strong></p><ol><li>Fluent in Django/Python.</li><li>Passion for front end development. In some cases this is mobile app development, in other cases, it's integration with other products that need to consume our APIs, or web development with AngularJS. This helps build better backends when you are the consumer.</li><li>Possess strongly held beliefs and aren't afraid to voice them. Opinions are usually based on something very specific related either to past experiences or to the platform, and very rarely theoretical.</li><li>At least one specific area of excellence in the skills mentioned below - you know this cold!</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills You'll Need </strong></p><ol><li>Python/Django - We use lots of it.&nbsp;</li><li>Docker, AWS - specifically the following services - ECS, S3, SQS.</li><li>PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana - Core of the platform.</li><li>RabbitMQ, Terraform and other ancillary services that we offer.</li><li>Front End - Pick one: React Native, Angular, Swift, Android.</li></ol><p><strong>The Interview Process </strong></p><ol><li>If you like what you've heard so far and want to come work for us, please send us your resume along with some code samples!</li><li>Give us three (3) days to review and respond. We'll try to respond to everyone who appears to be a good fit.</li><li>A hands-on coding challenge.</li><li>A 60-minute technical conversation about the coding challenge and your resume.</li><li>An in-person interview at our offices.</li><li>A finalized job offer.</li></ol>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Advanced Threat Analytics, Inc.            </h2>            <div><p>Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) is helping MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers) and enterprises finally break free of “alert tyranny” – a state when the volume of security alerts grows so out of control – it dictates staffing levels and operational business models. Traditional SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and incident orchestration solutions try to address the issue by reducing the time it takes to investigate each incident. They do not address the volume issue. ATA takes a different approach – we attack the problem by dramatically slashing the total number of incidents you need to investigate – freeing you from alert overload. This enables you to take a more efficient, effective, and strategic approach to security operations.</p><p><strong>Why Us?</strong></p><ol><li>We are incredibly fast-paced. You must be able to get on board with our pace.</li><li>We turn on a dime - something that sounds like a good idea today, doesn't mean it is - we are fine with that. We like to experiment.</li><li>We are growing at 150% YOY, which means a lot more demands from customers - we like to delight them all!</li><li>Equity and work culture is fantastic! We love what we do and it shows in our work.</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions.

Do you also enjoy engineering management books, and believe in  the value of engineering apprenticeship, which can allow junior engineers to level up in their career? If so, you might enjoy being a Senior Software Engineer at Parse.ly.</p><p>First, let’s answer a key question: what’s Parse.ly? Well, Parse.ly is a real-time content measurement layer for the entire web. Our analytics platform helps digital storytellers at some of the web's best sites, such as Arstechnica, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch, The Intercept, Mashable, and many more. In total, our analytics system handles over 65 billion monthly events from over 1 billion monthly unique visitors.</p><p>Our entire stack is in Python and JavaScript, and our team has innovated in areas related to real-time analytics, building some of the best open source tools for working with modern stream processing technologies.</p><p>On the open source front, we maintain <a href='https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse' rel='nofollow'>streamparse</a>, the most widely used Python binding for the Apache Storm streaming data system. We also maintain <a href='https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka' rel='nofollow'>pykafka</a>, the most performant and Pythonic binding for Apache Kafka.</p><p>Our colleagues are talented: our UX/design team has also built one of the best-looking dashboards on the planet, using AngularJS and D3.js, and our infrastructure engineers have built a scalable devops-friendly cloud environment.</p><p>As a Senior Software Engineer, you would master our backend stack -- or,  fill in whatever gaps you might be missing if you already know some of our technologies. But you’d also spend a portion of your time defining a roadmap for our “Customer Success Engineering” group, which is a group of bright engineers, more junior in their career, who are focusing on customer-facing and customer-deployed data integration challenges. It’s an ideal opportunity to put your programming skills to use, while also flexing some engineering and project management skills, to boot.</p><h4>Responsibilities</h4><p>Parse.ly’s data engineering team already makes use of modern technologies like Python, Storm, Spark, Kafka, and Elasticsearch to analyze large datasets. As a Software Engineer at Parse.ly, you will be expected to master these technologies, while also being able to write code against them in Python, and debug issues down to the native C code and native JVM code layers, as necessary.</p><p>However, your focus will be on deep understanding, commensurate with your technical background. Our product is widely used by over 250 enterprises with over 30,000 active seats, each of whom is viewing our data on a regular basis, and we have a team of engineers who help assist these customers with understanding their data, debugging data integration problems, and investigating code and data discrepancies. You would lead this team with its own focused roadmap of how to apply programming skills to solve customer problems.</p><p>Examples of past projects this team has built:</p><ul><li>A page data debugging tool, using web crawling</li><li>An automated system for re-processing customer data to correct historical errors</li><li>A public API explorer tool, for understanding how to use our HTTP/JSON API</li><li>An admin panel for tracking customer usage, pricing tiers, and invites</li><li>An Amazon Redshift based data warehouse for doing product usage analytics</li></ul><p>If you get excited by the idea of specifying and clarifying requirements around “quick-win” engineering projects that have a huge impact on the business and on how our customers interact with our support team, this is an ideal role for you.</p><h4>What you'll do</h4><p>For this role, you should already be a proficient programmer who wants to work with data at scale. You should already have, or be willing to gain, a full level of Python expertise.</p><p>In the role, you’ll...</p><ul><li>Write Python code using the best practices. See <a href='https://github.com/amontalenti/elements-of-python-style' rel='nofollow'>The Elements of Python Style</a>, written by our CTO, for an example of our approach to code readability and design.</li><li>Analyze data at massive scale. You need to be comfortable with the idea of your code running across 3,000 Python cores, thanks to process-level parallelization.</li><li>Brainstorm new ideas for how automation can solve problems for our customer success team. You need to be a good communicator, especially in written form.</li><li>Own a product roadmap for &quot;Customer Success Engineering&quot;, with a team of at least 5 junior engineers who would execute that roadmap.</li><li>Directly mentor these 5 engineers as they gain new skills in programming, web development, and data analysis.</li><li>Master cloud technologies and systems. You should love UNIX and be able to reason about distributed systems.</li></ul><h4>Benefits</h4><p>Our distributed team is best-in-class and we happily skip commutes by working out of our ergonomic home offices. Here's <a href='https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73' rel='nofollow'>a photograph of our CTO's setup running two full-screen Parse.ly dashboards</a>.</p><ul><li>Work from home or anywhere else in our industry-leading distributed team.</li><li>Earn a competitive salary and benefits (health/dental/401k).</li><li>Splurge with a generous equipment budget.</li><li>Work with one of the brightest teams in tech.</li><li>Speak at and attend conferences like PyData on Parse.ly's dime.</li></ul><h4>Parse.ly Tech</h4><ul><li>Python for both backend and frontend -- 2.7, some systems in 3.x, and we're going full-on 3.x soon.</li><li>Amazon Web Services used for most systems.</li><li>Modern databases like Cassandra, ElasticSearch, Redis, and Postgres.</li><li>Frameworks like Django, Tornado and the PyData stack (e.g. Pandas).</li><li>Running Kafka, Storm, Spark in production atop massive data sets.</li><li>Easy system management with Fabric and Chef.</li></ul><h4>Fully distributed team</h4><p>Parse.ly is a fully distributed team, with engineers working from across the world. People with past experience working remotely will be prioritized. US/Eastern timezones will be prioritized.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United States</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>EST or CST (or nearby)</p></dd>        </dl>",

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the day-to-day realities of programming.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75K-95K (Mid-Level) and $95-115K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>I know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>If you are local, we do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.
