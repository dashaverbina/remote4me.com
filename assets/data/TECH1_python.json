Do you eat DHTs, blockchains &amp; P2P routing algorithms for lunch? Are ridiculously hard problems your idea of fun? Are you the kind of person who could figure out how to create a uni-directional off-chain micro-payment channel with multi-sig support for a verifiable market with order matching and final settlement via smart contract, without trusted parties - taking into account the impossibility of fair exchange without a trusted third party, maybe based on probabilistic payments and/or zero knowledge contingent payments? Did you smile reading that last part? Good, it’s more fun when you have a sense of humor.</p><p>We’re working on changing the game with the backing of the world’s largest VPN service. An unstoppable multi-protocol decentralized onion routing system that is going to weave privacy into the very fabric of the Internet.
