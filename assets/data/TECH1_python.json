    "content": "<p>Who we are!</p><p>We are a new tech venture, founded by serial entrepreneurs from the world of finance, technology and brand. Our mission is to change the way products and customer experiences are designed. To do this, we are harnessing open data - starting with Open Banking. We are creating a marketplace for developers, designers and entrepreneurs to deliver this next generation of digital products across sectors, not just banking.</p><p>We are on the side of the curious and problem-solving, from individual developers, to entrepreneurs, to big brands. We help inventors and idealists, dare devils and dreamers create incredible tech.</p><p>We are an engineering-first company, building the future of banking information exchange. Our people are diverse and based across the world, hired for their skills, not their background or connections. Growing at speed in a fast-paced environment, we are looking for experienced POC Python Developers to join our team.</p><p>We are a developer-first company, creating the future of banking information exchange. As a developer with us you’ll be responsible for building our API as a product that unifies financial/utility data feeds.</p><p>You will work on E2E encryption based on the signal protocol. You will be using engineering practices such as Test Automation, Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD), Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD). Yup, we do DevOps and always start our work with BDD feature files.</p><p>You will have the option of working remotely with flexible hours and will participate in monthly team meetups at our London offices. A great way to put a face to the commits!</p><p>Here are some skills that will come in handy:</p><ul><li>Experience writing REST wrappers for legacy projects (SOAP for example);</li><li>Good at solving problems and knowing how to document those problems inBehave/Celery;</li><li>Having an understanding of why it’s irresponsible to write an API without consumingit at the same time.</li></ul><p>With this role we are looking strictly for people who can, from 1-2 paragraphs of text, fill in the blanks and in matter of few days deliver a technical POC. It can be dirty, it can be barely- working, but it must prove that we can deliver it, and that it will work as we need it to (also known as meeting business requirements). This will be done with very little to no supervision, but plenty of available people to talk to if you need to bounce ideas off someone!</p>",

We help students deeply learn concepts, build projects, work together, and gain the confidence they need to start new careers.  Read more about our philosophy at <a href='https://www.dataquest.io/blog/the-perfect-data-science-learning-tool/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dataquest.io/blog/the-perfect-data-science-learning-tool/</a>, and read what students think at <a href='https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/dataquest' rel='nofollow'>https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/dataquest</a>.</p><p>We're a bootstrapped mission-driven team of 11 people, and we've been growing quickly since we launched 3 years ago.  We're a close-knit team, and we make a point to help each other out, and talk about things beyond work.</p><p>We're looking for an intermediate backend-oriented engineer with full-stack experience to help support and evolve our learning platform. We currently need the most help in upgrading our existing Django codebase, but you will also likely be jumping in on frontend interfaces, developing new microservices, and offering opinions on devops.  You'll have a lot of autonomy in how you work and what you work on, as long as it's having an impact on our students.</p><p>This is a fully remote role and we are open to applications worldwide.  You don't have to match all of the listed requirements to apply -- we're looking for people who can grow along with our team, so please reach out if this job is interesting to you.</p><p>Requirements</p><p>We don't have a concrete set of requirements on skills. We know that any problem you are working on requires research; otherwise it wouldn't be a problem. Rather, we'd like to describe some traits that a successful developer in this role might have:</p><p> * You are able to dive into a complicated Python codebase and confidently make changes.<br> * You think about how to measure the effectiveness of the features you work on.<br> * If you're blocked on something, you instinctively find other things to contribute while you wait.<br> * You contribute to architectural discussions.<br> * When you need help, you provide the necessary context for someone to address your concerns without follow-up questions.<br> * Sometimes you stare into space thinking about how you would explain a topic to someone less familiar with it.<br> * You are eager to ask questions if you don't understand something and initial research isn't helping.<br> * If a merge request deletes more code than it creates, you think it's a good day.<br> * When you hear about a new technology, you wonder how it can improve your work rather than worrying about having to learn it.<br> * You are often happiest in backend coding, but occasionally dabble in frontend and devops work.</p><p>Our Stack</p><p>These are some of the technologies you'll be working with at Dataquest, though you may end up introducing new ones:</p><p> Our frontend is a modern react/redux stack utilizing cutting edge javascript/ecmascript features.<br> Communication with the backend happens over a combination of websockets, GraphQL, and REST APIs.<br> The main backend is Django on Python 3 utilizing Celery, Django-channels, and graphene.<br> We have a few microservices in Asyncio and Node, and plan to build more.<br> We use Docker extensively, both for student code execution, and for deployment of our services.<br> Our data is largely stored in Postgres, with some caching in Redis.<br> We use git for source control and gitlab for pipelines.</p><p>Why you should work at Dataquest</p><p>At Dataquest, you'll get:</p><p>* The opportunity to see your impact on the lives of our students every day.<br>* The chance to work with an engaged and mission-driven team.<br>* The chance to contribute to product direction and decisions.<br>* Autonomy and control over how you work.<br>* The ability to work remotely.<br>* A supportive environment where you can get help when you run into blockers.</p></div>",

We teach leadership to high-performing individuals who want to level up (altmba.com), and we teach marketing that you can be proud of because it's ethical, generous, and effective (themarketingseminar.com). </p><p>In the process we're trying to change online education. Most online courses have a massive drop-out rate, and don't create an environment that enables the student to grow. </p><p>The apps are dashboards and onboarding sites that helps us manage our student experience.</p><p>We're looking for someone we can work with long-term, but to start we're going to focus on one new piece of functionality we need to add to the apps.</p><p>This is a freelance position, working remotely.</p><h2>Current Project</h2><p>We need a UI that lets Sam upload a CSV of students, and gives her back a CSV of payment links for each student. </p><p>We're currently doing this semi-manually. Alex modifies a few config files and then runs a python script from Heroku's command line. Much of the functionality is already developed. What we need is a bit more functionality to check the CSV to make sure it's formatted correctly, and a UI that let's Sam set the config variables and run the process from the web app. </p><h2>Tech Notes</h2><p>The app is built using a procedural programming style (not object-oriented).</p><p>Since the app is (mostly) internal-facing we value speed and getting to &quot;good enough,&quot; more than we care about performance optimization or eliminating all the bugs.

We currently need the most help in upgrading our existing Django codebase, but you will also likely be jumping in on frontend interfaces, developing new microservices, and offering opinions on devops.
