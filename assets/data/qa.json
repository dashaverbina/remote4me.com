We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work. </p><p>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal! </p><p>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>. Please read it and if you’re willing to work this way, read on! </p><p><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:matthew.gossage@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>matthew.gossage@crometrics.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em> </p><h4><strong>Our Culture</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>We’re a remote company.</strong> &nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li><strong>We work hard and move fast.</strong> &nbsp;We’re working on a lot of different websites with varying underlying technologies. You’ll see a lot of pages and forms and there’s not a lot of automation. Maintaining quality while working on so much requires more than just checking boxes, you’ll need to think critically.</li><li><strong>Again, we’re a remote company.&nbsp;</strong> That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li></ul></div></div><div></div></div></div></div>",

We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>. Please read it and if you’re willing to work this way, read on!<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:matthew.gossage@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>matthew.gossage@crometrics.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em><br></div><div></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><h4><b>Our Culture</b></h4></div><ul><li><span><b>We’re a remote company.</b></span>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li><b>We work hard and move fast.</b>&nbsp;We’re working on a lot of different websites with varying underlying technologies. You’ll see a lot of pages and forms and there’s not a lot of automation. Maintaining quality while working on so much requires more than just checking boxes, you’ll need to think critically.</li><li><b><strong>Again, we’re a remote company.</strong>&nbsp;</b>That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Interested in working with us?
