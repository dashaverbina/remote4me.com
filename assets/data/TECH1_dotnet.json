But lawyers are terribly served by traditional recruitment agencies, who rely on anonymised web ads or inexperienced cold callers to engage potential legal recruits.<br /><br />Our founders, Tom Balmer and David Crocker, have been involved in the establishment and growth of some of the best names in the legal recruitment industry since the early noughties.  In 2017 they launched Third Way Legal, a marketplace platform designed to change the way lawyers engage with the jobs market.<br /><br />Third Way is a unique network, where lawyers can confidentially see which firms are looking for lawyers like them (in some ways it is similar to workinginstartups.com!). Following an amazing first year, where we have grown to 6 people and are annualising a million in turnover, we now are looking to build an in-house tech team.<br /><br />It's an extremely exciting time to join the business.  We are expanding into the interim market, looking to grow into new geographies, and have so many new feature ideas it hurts.  We're looking for a full-stack developer, comfortable with front and back end development, who is pragmatic and can eager to grow with the firm.  If that sounds like you, and you'd like to join us on our journey to change the legal recruitment industry, please get in touch!",

Du kan rätta fel och&nbsp;lägga till features&nbsp;genom att programmera i befintlig teknik, men också vara med och driva utvecklingen för&nbsp;den nya produkten.</p><p>Du gillar förmodligen precis som oss att utforska och använda nya teknologier i utvecklingsarbetet mot framtidens webbapplikationer. Du har själv - på fritiden eller i tidigare jobb - arbetat med hela produkten från design, arkitektur, back-end och front-end till deployment. Kanske har du en publik GitHub med något spännande projekt!?&nbsp;</p><p>Du&nbsp;har erfarenhet av ASP.NET web forms&nbsp;men också intresse av nyare teknologier. Vi gillar&nbsp;och tror att framtiden är att bygga snabba moduler i med frond-end i React.</p><p><strong>Vårt företag<br></strong>På e-Avrop utvecklar vi ett omfattande IT-stöd för upphandling, där svenska och utländska myndigheter, kommuner och företag får hjälp med hela upphandlingsprocessen.</p><p>Vår produkt har mängder av spännande funktionalitet såsom visuella processmodeller, rättighetsstyrd dokumenthantering, och realtidslösning för auktioner. Vi ser också många möjligheter för framtidens utveckling, med både business intelligence, machine learning och annat smart användande av vår samlade data. Allt för att kunna erbjuda nya och bättre tjänster inom området.</p><p>Vårt mål är att utveckla en enkel och kraftfull plattform med stor flexibilitet för upphandlare och företag. Vårt fokus ligger i att användarupplevelsen ska kännas modern, snabb och ha genomtänkt gränssnitt.&nbsp;</p><p>När vi träffas ses vi i trivsamma lokaler på&nbsp;Östermalm i Stockholm, ett stenkast från Tekniska Högskolan. Övrig tid jobbar vi effektivt hemifrån, med dagliga scrum-möten online.</p><p><strong>Arbetsuppgifter</strong><strong><br></strong>Den huvudsakliga arbetsuppgiften är underhåll av den befintliga web-applikationen för upphandlingsstöd samt viss nyutveckling i varierande teknologier. Vi jobbar i korta sprintar med prioriterad backlog.</p><p>Arbetet omfattar hela kedjan från rent underhållsarbete och bug-rättningar till feature requests med design av gränssnitt, datamodell,&nbsp;och teknisk lösning.</p><p>Vår utveckling sker främst i .Net-miljö (ASP.NET web forms) men mycket av våra nyare lösningar innefattar modernare gränssnitt skrivna i React, AngularJS och ren javascript. Vi använder självklart senaste verktygen såsom Visual Studio Resharper/Rider och Webstorm. Vi kör både macOS och Windows och hanterar kod med GitFlow. Vi har ett agilt tänk och har i nuläget en helt automatisk byggprocess och deployment.<br><br><strong>Din profil</strong><br>Vi tror att du är civilingenjör, datavetare eller motsvarande och har arbetat ett par år med systemutveckling. Du är van med att implementera webbservices och andra API:er såsom REST med flera och har goda kunskaper inom webbtekniker. Vidare tror vi att du har erfarenhet inom .NET, ASP web forms, C# och javascriptsbaserade front-end teknologier.&nbsp;</p><p>För att lyckas i rollen tror vi att du är analytiskt lagd, har ett strukturerat arbetssätt med en adaptiv syn på teknologi.

If you like tinkering with new technologies, have experience with high scale systems, or simply want to gain exposure to new tools, this team is a great fit. You’d be helping the team embrace microservices architecture with an emphasis on non-blocking, highly concurrent programming. Experience with Scala/Play/Akka is highly preferred, but not a requirement. With strong CS fundamentals and an entrepreneurial attitude, you’d be an asset to our team.</p><p>We are also seeking a Senior Engineer with C#/.NET experience to join our Stream Security team. This team is responsible protecting our content, with projects that span a wide variety of security concepts including studio grade DRM. We're looking for a candidate with C#/.NET experience but also an openness to expand into Scala. This is a unique opportunity in a high visibility team with significant impact.</p><p>PM me to apply.</p><p>Read more here: <a href='https://www.bamtechmedia.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.bamtechmedia.com/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Where you get the chance to engage with industry leaders and Microsoft product teams to solve cutting-edge problems for our clients?</p><p>Endjin are hiring developers at all levels, from apprentices to seniors, to work on exciting projects with clients from all over the world, in verticals from retail to financial services, utilities and media.</p><p>Endjin specialises in digital transformation using Azure, Data &amp; AI. We have built 100k+ core Azure grids, and petabyte-scale storage solutions. We've produced machine learning algorithms that find the anomalies in hundreds of millions of device messages, or built bots that help a person sell their watch online.</p><p>Endjin was incorporated in 2010 by two founders wanting to create a sustainable long-term business with organic growth delivered by deep partnerships with our clients.</p><p>Since then, we've helped organizations of all sizes, across many industries to transform how they invest, envisage, build, deploy, test, manage, and grow new digital offerings.</p><p>We also structure innovation programmes, process improvement, and DevSecOps, as well as delivering production-ready code, cloud infrastructure, and thought-leadership content.</p><p>We value life-long learning and an eye for quality. We will help you to find the best learning techniques, tools, and team-working, so that you can achieve your potential, and deliver the best value to our clients; while balancing your personal goals and home life.</p><p>Our employees have a mutual respect, regardless of where they are in their career. Ideas are developed by the whole team, from interns to seniors.</p><p>Equally, our clients pass the &quot;nice to work for&quot; test (and usually do so with flying colours). As part of that, we try to understand the ethical implications of the work we undertake. We seek to do the best we can for each other, for our profession, clients, and for the world at large. With no external investors, endjin has been built as a sustainable, lifelong business: we are a company to retire out of, not exit at the expense of the employees.</p><p>You can work remotely from anywhere in the UK, with hubs in Cambridge, Reading, Hampshire and London. We hold meet-ups in London on a regular basis. You design your ideal working environment, and we will make it happen together.</p><p>Apart from a real passion for learning, you know a couple of programming languages pretty well (we do a lot of C# and Typescript, but you may know R, or Python too). You love working with other people, but value the opportunity to spend time in your own head, thinking things through.</p><p>You can learn more about our projects at <a href='https://endjin.com' rel='nofollow'>https://endjin.com</a>, see a video about our career development pathways <a href='https://vimeo.com/200191869' rel='nofollow'>https://vimeo.com/200191869</a> or read our blog <a href='https://blogs.endjin.com' rel='nofollow'>https://blogs.endjin.com</a></p><p>Contact us on hello-at-endjin-dot-com if you think this looks like a good opportunity for you.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Applications will include customer facing web solutions as well as sophisticated toolset solutions.<br /><br />We don’t believe in silos or hierarchy, and our flat team structure gives us all a broad range of responsibility and plenty of autonomy. You will have the opportunity to work on any areas that make up a modern e-commerce solution – from the front-end website through to the applications that manage it.  You will design and develop full stack solutions from inception to delivery, and will leverage and improve our fully automated delivery processes.  Above all you will embrace new technologies to help continue keeping the business at the cutting edge, especially in the area of distributed cloud services.<br /><br /><br />*The Person*<br /><br />•    You are a hands-on developer who likes to craft great solutions and deliver quality software. You are pragmatic and understand that the best approach to development is blending technologies and methodologies to the task at hand.<br />•    You like the idea of joining a small talented team, and collaborating with your colleagues on a daily basis.<br />•    You have experience of developing in C#/.Net in a SQL Server environment.<br />•    You enjoy and wish to continue developing and delivering software - although you like to also participate in the solution/architecture process.<br />•    You may have certain technical strengths and corresponding weaknesses - we can work with that! The key is being able to collaborate within a team to add real value to the process.<br />•    You will have experience of some of the stack/solutions we work on and the ability to pick up anything that you are currently missing.<br />•    You will have gained some e-commerce or transactional experience during your career.<br />•    You are flexible in your approach to your work, and will strive to ensure that we deliver to our habitual high standards. <br />•    You may need to communicate with our clients from time to time, and can do so confidently and articulately.<br />•    We do not ask for a minimum number of years’ experience – we are more interested in what you can do, than in how long you have been doing it.<br /><br /><br />*More about tcpl*<br /><br />tcpl was founded on the principle that smaller teams of true experts can deliver better, faster and more customer centric solutions. We started strong and our first client was the French Connection Group PLC in 2006, who, more than a decade later, still enjoys working with us.<br /><br />Building on our reputation and experience, we have grown our client base steadily and now work with some of the most exciting brands, charities and organisations in the UK as their long-term technical e-commerce partner, delivering industry leading e-commerce solutions, as well as providing expert development and technical services.<br /><br />We enjoy low staff turnover and keep the team small, tight and collaborative – we are currently 12 people, with plans to increase to c.16 over the coming months in order to deliver upon our clients’ ambitious plans.  We all enjoy our work, and are proud of the value that we add to our clients’ businesses, enjoying competitive salaries and benefits whilst working in a relaxed, sociable yet professional environment in a bright office in Marylebone.  <br /><br /><br />*How to Apply*<br /><br />If you believe you have relevant experience and that tcpl could be the place where you can contribute and grow, just send us your CV.<br /><br /><br />_Please note: The role requires that you work in our office in London for most of the time, although some home working is fine. People who wish to work remotely 100% or who are unable to work in the UK need not apply._<br /><br />_Sorry - no agencies please._<br />",

    "title": "Full Time: Leading SAAS Searching for Senior Full-Stack Developer & Project Lead at SixLeaf in remote",
    "content": "<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p><p>SixLeaf is the leading marketing platform for third party sellers on Amazon.com as well as a variety of other e-commerce marketplaces. We offer a suite of complete software solutions for brands, both big and small, selling online. These solutions significantly improve marketplace performance and profit for our clients. Simply: we help Brands become ecommerce empires.</p><p>Since 2014, our mission has beento help as many brands as possible scale to the point where they are household names. And our goal is to be the very best at it. Since 2014, we’ve established ourselves as the revolutionary innovators in a fast-paced industry. By helping quality brands grow, not only can we assist our clients to achieve their dreams, but we make the market a better place for consumers. Each member of our team shares in the joy and responsibility of making the ecommerce world a better place.</p><p><strong>What We Are Looking For:</strong></p><p>We are, essentially, looking for a Unicorn, and we understand this. We are searching for a capable, full-stack developer with leadership skills. Our project managers have superior coding capabilities because our projects are complex, and we aren’t looking for a project lead who only understands the lingo.</p><p>We need someone who can get into the codebase and get their hands dirty when necessary. The project lead will write the backlog and assign tasks to developers working on the project, but may also help correct complicated issues, and on particularly hairy deadlines, may also assist in coding.</p><p>We’re looking for a self-starter and a team player who is able to adapt to a rapidly growing and evolving organization in an industry that moves fast. We’re looking for a leader who can act as a multiplier and makes others around them better through automation, code review, documentation, mentoring when necessary, and who can lead a small team confidently. We’re looking for a true software owner who genuinely cares about the impact our platform makes on the client and their Brand. And we’re looking for the naturally curious developer who doesn’t just accept engineering challenges - they embrace challenges and seek them out.</p><p><strong>Why Work With Us?</strong></p><p>SixLeaf was originally founded in 2014 as ZonBlast - a tool which completely revolutionized the Amazon marketing space. In the last 4 years, we’ve grown exponentially, have been featured at major industry events, on podcasts, and have proudly served thousands of Brand owners. We’ve had the honor of having a direct hand in taking entrepreneurs from mere idea to 7+ figure Brands.</p><p>As a team, we consider working for our early-stage tech startup a lifetyle choice, rather than a job choice. Working for SixLeaf can be challenging at times. We operate in a competitive and fast moving industry, so we need to hit aggressive deadlines and there are many times when everyone on the team puts in a lot more hours than they are used to. You’ll work hard but you’ll face exciting challenges that allow you to put your mark on the world.</p><p>As an important part of the SixLeaf team, you’ll be responsible for creating innovative tools that help turn our client’s Brands’ into e-commerce empires. You’ll design beautifully simple yet effective solutions that, once released, will provide measurable and direct impact clients’ businesses.</p><p><strong>As a valued SixLeaf team member, you’ll:</strong> </p><ul><li><p><strong>Learn Something New</strong>: It is very unlikely you’ve ever worked on a project quite like this. You’ll be exposed to a fascinating and challenging new world where you will be learning about an incredibly exciting industry that is still in its infancy. You will immediately make a difference and impact on SixLeaf, its customers, and this industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make More Money:</strong> To put it bluntly; we are generous. As a startup, we don’t quite have each benchmark that determines bonus structures and pay increases set in stone yet, but we have consistently been extremely giving. We’ve given a bonus each year for the “Christmas” season. We’ve given raises after each 90-day probationary period. We also regularly increase pay based on exemplary performance. </p></li><li><p><strong>Expand Your Skillset:</strong> You’ll be exposed to developers around the world who each bring a unique set of skills to the table. You’ll also be learning the intricacies of a relatively new industry to the SAAS space, which will require expansion on current knowledge. Overall, you will walk away from this job a more capable and productive individual having learned from the best in the industry.</p></li></ul><p>At SixLeaf, and as a fully distributed team, we value respect, transparency, dedication, and innovation. We honor our respective team-members strengths by promoting collaboration.</p><p>In addition, we offer:</p><ul><li><p>Generous pay, benefits, and performance-based bonuses</p></li><li><p>Generous paid time off policy</p></li><li><p>Ability to work remotely in a fully distributed team connected by tools like Slack, Zoom, and more</p></li><li><p>Access to a growing library of industry-specific educational material that will help you deliver the best for our clients</p></li><li><p>Flexible results-driven schedule</p></li><li><p>A team that has cares immeasurably about the results it provides for clients. We take what we do seriously. We know that the results we obtain for clients by way of the software you will help create and improve have direct impacts on entrepreneurs’ businesses, families, and lives. Though we may be distributed, the common drive and connection we all have rivals even </p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p><p>Developers are some of the brightest and most amazing people on the planet. However, they can also tend to overcomplicate things. Often, if you ask a developer to turn on a light, he’ll try to build a machine using complex algorithms and a system of wires to engage the light mechanism from their side of the room rather than just walk over to the switch and flip it.</p><p>What we need is a project lead that brings balance between genius ideas and common sense solutions. Someone who is nimble, cross-disciplinary, and mindful of client needs. Someone who embraces being a key player in the leadership team. And someone who is results-driven, focused on problem-solving and who can act as a multiplier in any team. If you are an out of the box thinker who loves to invent creative ways to solve problems while also seeing the simplest path, this may be for you.</p><p>If you aren’t afraid of hard work and want to be a part of a growing team hell-bent on taking over an entire niche, we may be a fit for each other.</p><p><strong>Job Summary:</strong></p><p>SixLeaf is searching for a skilled and experienced Information Systems Senior Developer and Project Lead. The ideal candidate will be a quick learner and creative problem solver. We are looking for someone that understands the technologies we use and can follow instructions. However, we also hope this individual can innovate and present more efficient ways to implement our technologies when possible. This candidate should also have management or team lead experience.</p><p>Aside from skills, the ideal candidate will also be passionate; about software development, learning new systems and platforms, and about what we do at SixLeaf. We are a rapidly growing force in our industry and hope to find team members as invested in our growth as we are in them.</p><p><strong>Who You Are:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Bachelor’s Degree of Computer Science or 6+ years working experience with a portfolio of work</p></li><li><p>Must be familiar with Git Branching and Agile design practices </p></li><li><p>Thorough understanding of C#, MVS, and N-Tier design methodologies</p></li><li><p>Superior English written and verbal communication skills</p></li><li><p>Experience working with APIs.
