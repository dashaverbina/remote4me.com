If you like tinkering with new technologies, have experience with high scale systems, or simply want to gain exposure to new tools, this team is a great fit. You’d be helping the team embrace microservices architecture with an emphasis on non-blocking, highly concurrent programming. Experience with Scala/Play/Akka is highly preferred, but not a requirement. With strong CS fundamentals and an entrepreneurial attitude, you’d be an asset to our team.</p><p>We are also seeking a Senior Engineer with C#/.NET experience to join our Stream Security team. This team is responsible protecting our content, with projects that span a wide variety of security concepts including studio grade DRM. We're looking for a candidate with C#/.NET experience but also an openness to expand into Scala. This is a unique opportunity in a high visibility team with significant impact.</p><p>PM me to apply.</p><p>Read more here: <a href='https://www.bamtechmedia.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.bamtechmedia.com/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Where you get the chance to engage with industry leaders and Microsoft product teams to solve cutting-edge problems for our clients?</p><p>Endjin are hiring developers at all levels, from apprentices to seniors, to work on exciting projects with clients from all over the world, in verticals from retail to financial services, utilities and media.</p><p>Endjin specialises in digital transformation using Azure, Data &amp; AI. We have built 100k+ core Azure grids, and petabyte-scale storage solutions. We've produced machine learning algorithms that find the anomalies in hundreds of millions of device messages, or built bots that help a person sell their watch online.</p><p>Endjin was incorporated in 2010 by two founders wanting to create a sustainable long-term business with organic growth delivered by deep partnerships with our clients.</p><p>Since then, we've helped organizations of all sizes, across many industries to transform how they invest, envisage, build, deploy, test, manage, and grow new digital offerings.</p><p>We also structure innovation programmes, process improvement, and DevSecOps, as well as delivering production-ready code, cloud infrastructure, and thought-leadership content.</p><p>We value life-long learning and an eye for quality. We will help you to find the best learning techniques, tools, and team-working, so that you can achieve your potential, and deliver the best value to our clients; while balancing your personal goals and home life.</p><p>Our employees have a mutual respect, regardless of where they are in their career. Ideas are developed by the whole team, from interns to seniors.</p><p>Equally, our clients pass the &quot;nice to work for&quot; test (and usually do so with flying colours). As part of that, we try to understand the ethical implications of the work we undertake. We seek to do the best we can for each other, for our profession, clients, and for the world at large. With no external investors, endjin has been built as a sustainable, lifelong business: we are a company to retire out of, not exit at the expense of the employees.</p><p>You can work remotely from anywhere in the UK, with hubs in Cambridge, Reading, Hampshire and London. We hold meet-ups in London on a regular basis. You design your ideal working environment, and we will make it happen together.</p><p>Apart from a real passion for learning, you know a couple of programming languages pretty well (we do a lot of C# and Typescript, but you may know R, or Python too). You love working with other people, but value the opportunity to spend time in your own head, thinking things through.</p><p>You can learn more about our projects at <a href='https://endjin.com' rel='nofollow'>https://endjin.com</a>, see a video about our career development pathways <a href='https://vimeo.com/200191869' rel='nofollow'>https://vimeo.com/200191869</a> or read our blog <a href='https://blogs.endjin.com' rel='nofollow'>https://blogs.endjin.com</a></p><p>Contact us on hello-at-endjin-dot-com if you think this looks like a good opportunity for you.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Applications will include customer facing web solutions as well as sophisticated toolset solutions.<br /><br />We don’t believe in silos or hierarchy, and our flat team structure gives us all a broad range of responsibility and plenty of autonomy. You will have the opportunity to work on any areas that make up a modern e-commerce solution – from the front-end website through to the applications that manage it.  You will design and develop full stack solutions from inception to delivery, and will leverage and improve our fully automated delivery processes.  Above all you will embrace new technologies to help continue keeping the business at the cutting edge, especially in the area of distributed cloud services.<br /><br /><br />*The Person*<br /><br />•    You are a hands-on developer who likes to craft great solutions and deliver quality software. You are pragmatic and understand that the best approach to development is blending technologies and methodologies to the task at hand.<br />•    You like the idea of joining a small talented team, and collaborating with your colleagues on a daily basis.<br />•    You have experience of developing in C#/.Net in a SQL Server environment.<br />•    You enjoy and wish to continue developing and delivering software - although you like to also participate in the solution/architecture process.<br />•    You may have certain technical strengths and corresponding weaknesses - we can work with that! The key is being able to collaborate within a team to add real value to the process.<br />•    You will have experience of some of the stack/solutions we work on and the ability to pick up anything that you are currently missing.<br />•    You will have gained some e-commerce or transactional experience during your career.<br />•    You are flexible in your approach to your work, and will strive to ensure that we deliver to our habitual high standards. <br />•    You may need to communicate with our clients from time to time, and can do so confidently and articulately.<br />•    We do not ask for a minimum number of years’ experience – we are more interested in what you can do, than in how long you have been doing it.<br /><br /><br />*More about tcpl*<br /><br />tcpl was founded on the principle that smaller teams of true experts can deliver better, faster and more customer centric solutions. We started strong and our first client was the French Connection Group PLC in 2006, who, more than a decade later, still enjoys working with us.<br /><br />Building on our reputation and experience, we have grown our client base steadily and now work with some of the most exciting brands, charities and organisations in the UK as their long-term technical e-commerce partner, delivering industry leading e-commerce solutions, as well as providing expert development and technical services.<br /><br />We enjoy low staff turnover and keep the team small, tight and collaborative – we are currently 12 people, with plans to increase to c.16 over the coming months in order to deliver upon our clients’ ambitious plans.  We all enjoy our work, and are proud of the value that we add to our clients’ businesses, enjoying competitive salaries and benefits whilst working in a relaxed, sociable yet professional environment in a bright office in Marylebone.  <br /><br /><br />*How to Apply*<br /><br />If you believe you have relevant experience and that tcpl could be the place where you can contribute and grow, just send us your CV.<br /><br /><br />_Please note: The role requires that you work in our office in London for most of the time, although some home working is fine. People who wish to work remotely 100% or who are unable to work in the UK need not apply._<br /><br />_Sorry - no agencies please._<br />",

    "title": "Full Time: Leading SAAS Searching for Senior Full-Stack Developer & Project Lead at SixLeaf in remote",
    "content": "<p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p><p>SixLeaf is the leading marketing platform for third party sellers on Amazon.com as well as a variety of other e-commerce marketplaces. We offer a suite of complete software solutions for brands, both big and small, selling online. These solutions significantly improve marketplace performance and profit for our clients. Simply: we help Brands become ecommerce empires.</p><p>Since 2014, our mission has beento help as many brands as possible scale to the point where they are household names. And our goal is to be the very best at it. Since 2014, we’ve established ourselves as the revolutionary innovators in a fast-paced industry. By helping quality brands grow, not only can we assist our clients to achieve their dreams, but we make the market a better place for consumers. Each member of our team shares in the joy and responsibility of making the ecommerce world a better place.</p><p><strong>What We Are Looking For:</strong></p><p>We are, essentially, looking for a Unicorn, and we understand this. We are searching for a capable, full-stack developer with leadership skills. Our project managers have superior coding capabilities because our projects are complex, and we aren’t looking for a project lead who only understands the lingo.</p><p>We need someone who can get into the codebase and get their hands dirty when necessary. The project lead will write the backlog and assign tasks to developers working on the project, but may also help correct complicated issues, and on particularly hairy deadlines, may also assist in coding.</p><p>We’re looking for a self-starter and a team player who is able to adapt to a rapidly growing and evolving organization in an industry that moves fast. We’re looking for a leader who can act as a multiplier and makes others around them better through automation, code review, documentation, mentoring when necessary, and who can lead a small team confidently. We’re looking for a true software owner who genuinely cares about the impact our platform makes on the client and their Brand. And we’re looking for the naturally curious developer who doesn’t just accept engineering challenges - they embrace challenges and seek them out.</p><p><strong>Why Work With Us?</strong></p><p>SixLeaf was originally founded in 2014 as ZonBlast - a tool which completely revolutionized the Amazon marketing space. In the last 4 years, we’ve grown exponentially, have been featured at major industry events, on podcasts, and have proudly served thousands of Brand owners. We’ve had the honor of having a direct hand in taking entrepreneurs from mere idea to 7+ figure Brands.</p><p>As a team, we consider working for our early-stage tech startup a lifetyle choice, rather than a job choice. Working for SixLeaf can be challenging at times. We operate in a competitive and fast moving industry, so we need to hit aggressive deadlines and there are many times when everyone on the team puts in a lot more hours than they are used to. You’ll work hard but you’ll face exciting challenges that allow you to put your mark on the world.</p><p>As an important part of the SixLeaf team, you’ll be responsible for creating innovative tools that help turn our client’s Brands’ into e-commerce empires. You’ll design beautifully simple yet effective solutions that, once released, will provide measurable and direct impact clients’ businesses.</p><p><strong>As a valued SixLeaf team member, you’ll:</strong> </p><ul><li><p><strong>Learn Something New</strong>: It is very unlikely you’ve ever worked on a project quite like this. You’ll be exposed to a fascinating and challenging new world where you will be learning about an incredibly exciting industry that is still in its infancy. You will immediately make a difference and impact on SixLeaf, its customers, and this industry.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make More Money:</strong> To put it bluntly; we are generous. As a startup, we don’t quite have each benchmark that determines bonus structures and pay increases set in stone yet, but we have consistently been extremely giving. We’ve given a bonus each year for the “Christmas” season. We’ve given raises after each 90-day probationary period. We also regularly increase pay based on exemplary performance. </p></li><li><p><strong>Expand Your Skillset:</strong> You’ll be exposed to developers around the world who each bring a unique set of skills to the table. You’ll also be learning the intricacies of a relatively new industry to the SAAS space, which will require expansion on current knowledge. Overall, you will walk away from this job a more capable and productive individual having learned from the best in the industry.</p></li></ul><p>At SixLeaf, and as a fully distributed team, we value respect, transparency, dedication, and innovation. We honor our respective team-members strengths by promoting collaboration.</p><p>In addition, we offer:</p><ul><li><p>Generous pay, benefits, and performance-based bonuses</p></li><li><p>Generous paid time off policy</p></li><li><p>Ability to work remotely in a fully distributed team connected by tools like Slack, Zoom, and more</p></li><li><p>Access to a growing library of industry-specific educational material that will help you deliver the best for our clients</p></li><li><p>Flexible results-driven schedule</p></li><li><p>A team that has cares immeasurably about the results it provides for clients. We take what we do seriously. We know that the results we obtain for clients by way of the software you will help create and improve have direct impacts on entrepreneurs’ businesses, families, and lives. Though we may be distributed, the common drive and connection we all have rivals even </p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p><p>Developers are some of the brightest and most amazing people on the planet. However, they can also tend to overcomplicate things. Often, if you ask a developer to turn on a light, he’ll try to build a machine using complex algorithms and a system of wires to engage the light mechanism from their side of the room rather than just walk over to the switch and flip it.</p><p>What we need is a project lead that brings balance between genius ideas and common sense solutions. Someone who is nimble, cross-disciplinary, and mindful of client needs. Someone who embraces being a key player in the leadership team. And someone who is results-driven, focused on problem-solving and who can act as a multiplier in any team. If you are an out of the box thinker who loves to invent creative ways to solve problems while also seeing the simplest path, this may be for you.</p><p>If you aren’t afraid of hard work and want to be a part of a growing team hell-bent on taking over an entire niche, we may be a fit for each other.</p><p><strong>Job Summary:</strong></p><p>SixLeaf is searching for a skilled and experienced Information Systems Senior Developer and Project Lead. The ideal candidate will be a quick learner and creative problem solver. We are looking for someone that understands the technologies we use and can follow instructions. However, we also hope this individual can innovate and present more efficient ways to implement our technologies when possible. This candidate should also have management or team lead experience.</p><p>Aside from skills, the ideal candidate will also be passionate; about software development, learning new systems and platforms, and about what we do at SixLeaf. We are a rapidly growing force in our industry and hope to find team members as invested in our growth as we are in them.</p><p><strong>Who You Are:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Bachelor’s Degree of Computer Science or 6+ years working experience with a portfolio of work</p></li><li><p>Must be familiar with Git Branching and Agile design practices </p></li><li><p>Thorough understanding of C#, MVS, and N-Tier design methodologies</p></li><li><p>Superior English written and verbal communication skills</p></li><li><p>Experience working with APIs.

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more, and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out.</p><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand distraction-free for multiple hours totally.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><p>We have partial test coverage, and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each release.</p><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><p>Developers get the super fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><p>If you did follow directions, our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code, and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><p>If we like your refactoring, we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. Nothing super in-depth CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard, you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><p><strong>Want more detail about the benefits?</strong></p><p>You can see a preview of TrainerRoad's health benefits here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27' rel='nofollow'>https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27</a></p><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><p>Right now!

Only under our exceptional system can people from all backgrounds and skill levels, from total beginner to semi-professional, compete in the game of pool and have fun.</p><p>Our offices&nbsp;are located in Lake Saint Louis, MO, right on the lake. We have a very relaxed atmosphere to work in&nbsp;and we&nbsp;believe in a healthy work/life balance. APA is a family owned and operated business and the sense of family is very strong given that the average tenure of our employees is 10+ years.</p><h2>About the Position:</h2><p>While the APA has&nbsp;used technology for decades, our in-house development team is just a couple of years old and we’re growing it slowly and methodically to ensure proper fit of everyone we ask to join our team.

We are pushing the envelope for what our industry has seen in regard to customer experience and service. This position is for someone more skilled in Javascript (Node/Angular/React/Meteor) than .Net languages.

You are aware of what you know and don't know, but that doesn't stop you from tackling the hard problems with great enthusiasm, actually the more impossible the task, the more determined you are to find a solution. However, you understand when to call for help, when to ditch an idea and pivot to something different. You know when to push back on a requirement and ask for more clarity. You stay current on tech. You love what you do and are passionate about creating great software (or at least you dream of being on a team that wants you to do so). You may have a Comp Sci degree, but you may just have stumbled into software development and found that you had a knack for it. You know your craft and you may have even squealed a little inside when the word &quot;craft&quot; was used to describe software development. You have worked on an Agile Development team before and understand Sprints, User Stories, and Story Point estimation. If not, you just googled &quot;Agile Development&quot; to learn more because that's just who you are.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You have experience with some of the following (listed in order of importance):</span></p><ul><li>Building applications with React or a similar Javascript framework</li><li><span>Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3 and LESS, SASS, JCSS, etc.</span></li><li><span>Responsive web development experience - CSS media queries and JavaScript device detection</span></li><li><span>Production application experience with Cordova (we currently use Meteor and it's Cordova integration) and/or Electron</span></li><li><span>Working knowledge of Version Control such as Git or Mercurial</span></li><li><span>Experience with VB.Net, C#, MVC and/or ASP.Net (our API is C# WebAPI and legacy apps are in VB.Net)</span></li><li><span>Knowledgeable in Google Analytics/Google Tag Manager/Google Webmaster Tools a plus</span></li><li><span>Knowledgeable in WordPress/PHP a plus</span></li></ul><h2><span>Perks of working for APA:</span></h2><ul><li>You get your choice of computing hardware (Mac, PC, Laptop or Desktop, the choice is yours) and two or three massive 27&quot; monitors to go with it</li><li>We close our offices between Christmas and New Years</li><li>401k with a healthy company match (after 1 year)</li><li>Competitive health insurance options (after 90 days)</li><li>We have a flexible work from home accommodation for our St. Louis based employees</li><li><span>Paid time off</span></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

We love finding fixer-upper apps that provide amazing business value but need some remodeling. We're also a women-owned business and 66% of our leadership team are women.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our main focus is on making software applications more stable, scalable, and secure. We call this &quot;software remodeling&quot; and we approach our work through the lens of these core values:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Act With Empathy</b><span>: Listening and understanding&nbsp;</span>is<span>&nbsp;at the very heart of our culture. Consider the people who are impacted by your work: your clients, your users, your teammates, and even your future self.</span><br></li><li><b>Adopt a Growth Mindset</b><span>: Constantly find ways to expand your knowledge and learn new things. Your intelligence and talent are not fixed; they're developed over time through perseverance, dedication, and hard work.</span><br></li><li><b>Calm the Chaos</b>: Urgency leads to errors; frenzy to frustration. We focus on developing the steady working rhythm and calm mind that works best for solving complex problems.</li><li><b>Communication is Just as Important as Code:</b> No one at Corgibytes identifies themselves as a “technical” or “non-technical” because everyone is both. Practice both types of skills regularly.</li><li><b>Craftsmanship in Context:</b> Match your solution to the situation. Sometimes it’s a quick and dirty prototype to prove a concept. When the stakes are high, spending extra time getting it right is the best way to go.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Sound like you? Awesome! That's a great sign because we live these values every day. They’re a guide in making decisions, no matter how small. They’ve helped us develop a culture where folks are autonomous, responsible, and work hard without feeling burned out or like they have to choose between family and work. We’re the type of company where it’s common to see a toddler bouncing on a knee during a meeting. As an intentionally distributed team, we focus more on results than micromanagement. Our core values are key to our culture, as are our pillars of autonomy, balance, diversity, </span>and<span>&nbsp;trust.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>What Corgibytes Does<br></b></div><div><span>There’s a lot of existing code out there that needs to be modernized safely. We specialize in this and have even coined a new term — software remodeling — to describe what we do. In general, we focus on activities that make software more stable, scalable, and secure, which can often blend traditional development with more DevOps and consulting activities (ex: teaching our clients how to write good acceptance tests using Gherkin). In general, we refactor, introduce or improve test coverage, break up monolithic apps, upgrade frameworks in any language, framework or platform. The best part for you? You'll get to solve lots of really interesting engineering challenges!</span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>About The Role<br></b></div><div><span>We've got some projects coming down the pike and we're looking for some seasoned full-stack developers who enjoy working with existing codebases to make them better. We're particularly looking for folks who have solid skills with Rails&nbsp;</span>and/or .<span>NET. This will be a contractor position and part-time is okay.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here's a question: does </span>reconstructing<span> a database from the binary files without any documentation sound like a fun challenge? If so, you've got the right attitude! Most of the folks on our team identify as &quot;menders&quot; (as opposed to makers). Given the choice, they'd rather fix bugs, pay down technical debt, and work on support tickets instead of doing exploratory features. Many of our clients come to us with complex architectural problems and can't find the talent anywhere else. As a Lead Code Whisperer, you can work directly with a client to help them migrate platforms, address security vulnerabilities, integrate with obscure systems, and more. You love a challenge and can understand and articulate the business value of technical choices.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If a project requires a stack you haven’t used before, your instinct is to become eager, not intimidated. You regularly practice writing clean code with Test-Driven Development and document your rationale. You stay up-to-date with industry best practices and maybe you're even starting to contribute your thoughts through blogs, StackOverflow, presentations, etc. You are a mentor who loves helping other developers grow in their careers. You enjoy pair programming and take pride in giving solid feedback through pull requests and code reviews.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><div><b><span>Salary &amp; Benefits<br></span></b></div><div><span>We're currently looking for 1-2 contractors to add to our team. Our current rate for contractors is&nbsp;</span><span>$74.48/hour, which might seem a little odd, but here's how we got at such a specific number.&nbsp;</span><span>We started with an annual salary of $110k/year. Next, we divided that by 1920 (48 weeks/year at 40 hours per week - we assume you’d take 4 weeks per year off) and add 30% to compensate for contractor expenses (using your own equipment, paying your own health insurance, self-employment taxes, etc.).</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Other benefits include:</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>Work where and when you want.

How do I know they're legit and learn more about them?&quot; No worries, my friend.

We have a team of 8 developers who are very capable and committed (only one developer has left in the 12 years, and that was because he'd been offered a PhD placement). There are no office politics or any of that nonsense, it's a very collaborative environment. We try to keep quite a&nbsp;<em>flat</em>&nbsp;structure where we&nbsp;expect my developers to take responsibility for dealing with everything in their purview (with the CTO there as adviser if needed). This has allowed us to keep the team small and efficient.</p><p>Obviously with web-application development there's a reasonable amount of CRUD work, that's a given. But we have also developed interesting in-house tech of our own (distributed databases for document storage, natural language processing for clinical text parsing, UI frameworks, distributed config systems with PAXOS, language-ext, and echo-process, to name a few). We run on our own machines in high-security data-centres rather than on AWS/Azure, and so we have also developed our own in-house solutions for deployment, etc.</p><p>The people we need are 'self starters' and are happy to work on any part of the stack, from UI, to back-end, to data-centre automation, services etc. &nbsp;<strong>You must be prepared to develop code using the functional paradigm -&nbsp;this is super important, if you think Martin Fowler is a god, please don't apply. </strong></p><p>We need creatively minded individuals who can solve unique problems; not just with code problems, but in improving healthcare too. Healthcare professionals are often not very tech-savvy, and are therefore either scared or incapable of communicating with tech-people. So I need programmers than can hear a real world problem and think creatively and with empathy for the end user.</p><p>You should have significant C# and web-development experience (the web experience doesn't have to be with .NET, we use ASP.NET for our 'transport' mechanism only - we don't use any of the MS frameworks (other than the .NET BCL) -- they change so often, and when we started writing the app 12 years ago they were mostly awful). F# experience is useful but not essential. If you don't have F# experience, you will be expected to learn it and use it: we've been writing some of our satellite components in F#, and we want to use it more (the core application is C#, so that will give you time to get up to speed anyway).</p><p>If you know [Language-Ext](<a href='https://github.com/louthy/language-ext/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/louthy/language-ext</a>) (and understand why it exists) then that will help, as we use it throughout the application to bring robustness to our system. SQL Server is our primary database solution, so experience with that is essential - but we also use Postgres. If you have any Postgres experience that would be valuable.</p><p>We don't care about what degree you have (or don't have), but we do want to see experience and a passion for what you do. Github projects are the incredibly&nbsp;helpful for that. Written and spoken English must be good. And unfortunately until we know what is happening with Brexit: resident in the UK.</p><p>We offer a very attractive salary, employee profit sharing, and a relaxed working environment - working on proper technological solutions. You will not be forced/expected to work long hours as so often happens in software (in fact we actively discourage it). Remote working is also an option, most of the devs work remotely (but this must be after an initial in-office trial period of 3 months). &nbsp;Remote workers are expected to visit the office at least once per-month for the development team meeting, which is where the developers all get together to talk about interesting things (not always work related).</p><p><strong>No recruitment agencies / soliciting</strong></p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Significant experience in C# and evidence of a varied career in software development</p><p>Nice to have F# or any functional language experience</p><p>A willingness to use the functional language paradigm rather than OO</p><p>SQL Server / any relational database experience</p><p>Web application development experience</p><p>Outside interests that convey that you're a human being and not a robot!</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Medical Management Systems            </h2>            <div><p><em><strong>A collaborative and relaxed but professional and talented team</strong></em></p><p>We have a very relaxed working environment that is more akin to a start-up than a company that's been running for 12 years.

We hire great developers</strong></p><p>There are four things that make Mixed In Key interesting to work for:</p><ul><li>The company was started by a .NET developer, so he can read your code and help you solve problems</li><li>We never outsourced our software development to other companies, so we own and maintain 100% of our source code. We know the code inside-out, so we can always help you</li><li>We've written 30+ codebases with just 2-3 developers on each one. We work in small teams (1-3 developers, 1 QA, 1 designer on each task)</li><li>You will have a healthy live-work balance. There are guys who joined our team in 2006 and have created numerous new products because&nbsp;they enjoy their work and the challenges are always interesting</li><li>We love working with like-minded people who enjoy software development</li></ul><p><strong><br>3. Our goal is to teach people how to compose great music</strong></p><p>About a month ago, we launched our new product called&nbsp;Captain Plugins. Magazine press and our fans loved it, so we have a wish list of&nbsp;hundreds of feature requests and ideas on what to build next.&nbsp;That is why we're hiring -- we have a lot of interesting work</p><p>Here's the YouTube video showing how the plugin works:</p><p><a title=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcyutjSZFlPpsgT0MPj6fFaa57EZo_Zhe&amp;v=7_OAh578qqA&quot; href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcyutjSZFlPpsgT0MPj6fFaa57EZo_Zhe&amp;v=7_OAh578qqA' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcyutjSZFlPpsgT0MPj6fFaa57EZo_Zhe&amp;v=7_OAh578qqA</a></p><p>One of the best testimonials we've gotten is that &quot;These plugins close the door on the past.&quot; They are a brand-new way to write music and create songs from scratch.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; requirements</strong></p><p>Our&nbsp;technology stack is based on .NET, using C#, AngularJS, TypeScript, Canvas, HTML5 + CSS3, SQL and more. If you're comfortable with WPF on desktop and HTML5/Canvas/MVC on web, you'll be able to read our code easily and develop new products</p><p><strong><br>What we require:</strong></p><p>1) Deep knowledge of the .NET stack</p><p>2) Natural curiosity for how things work</p><p>3) You&nbsp;taking a lot of initiative. This is part of the job requirement - we hire people who take initiative</p><p>4) You can work 4 days a week (Tuesday-Friday, or Monday-Thursday), or 5 days a week depending on your preference. We don't hire for less than 32 hours per week</p><p><strong>Send us an email</strong></p><p>We're not a big anonymous corporation, we're a small team of .NET developers who love making music tools.

We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast &quot;good enough&quot; approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in &quot;science experiment land&quot;</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>US Person based anywhere in the US (100% remote allowed but no off shore)</li><li>5 Years work experience as a programmer</li><li>Highly Comfortable with C# and Visual Studio</li><li>Experienced with Web Development &amp; JavaScript</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About MapLarge            </h2>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our platform powers high traffic website visualizations, data discovery, and business intelligence applications.
