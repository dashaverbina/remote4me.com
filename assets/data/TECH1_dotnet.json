Whether we’re helping developers get answers to their questions or find new jobs, we build products that affect millions of developers’ lives every day. Our goal is to create a community and a company where everyone feels welcome to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. We’re not there yet, which is why we’re hoping you’ll join us!</p><p>As a full-stack web developer, you’ll join a cross-disciplinary team of developers, designers, and product managers working within a specific product area. Some recent projects we’ve been working on:</p><ul><li>Our newest products, Stack Overflow for Teams and for Enterprise, which give organizations a private, secure home for their team’s questions and answers.</li><li>New experiments on Stack Overflow Talent and Engagement to help companies reach and engage developers with job and advertising opportunities.</li><li>Improving our search algorithms to help developers find the answers they need across both public and private Stack Overflow Q&amp;A.</li><li>Modifying the Ask Question page and comments in order to make Stack Overflow easier to use and more welcoming to newcomers.</li></ul><p>You’ll work primarily in our main tech stack of C#, ASP.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server, with supporting technologies like Redis, TypeScript, and Elasticsearch. We don’t expect you to know everything coming in, so we’ll pair you with mentors who will help you learn and develop.</p><p><strong>We’re a remote-first team, so you’ll have the option to work from home or out of our New York office. Wherever you work, you’ll be part of a remote work culture that emphasizes online communication (Trello, Slack, GitHub, Hangouts) and asynchronous collaboration wherever possible.</strong></p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>We expect to see:</strong></p><ul><li>Solid programming skills in your language of choice (not necessarily ours) and a track record of getting stuff done.</li><li>3+ years full-stack web dev experience with any major server-side stack, relational database, and modern front-end (JS, HTML, CSS).

We hire smart people, set them up for success, then get out of their way.</li><li>Collaboration: The best products are created when people from different backgrounds and disciplines work closely together in an environment of respect and trust.</li><li>Transparency: Trust is built on openness and transparency. If there is not a good reason to keep it a secret, we share it. For example, we share our complete engineering salary formula.</li><li>Inclusion: We do our best work when we can be our whole selves at work. We’re committed to policies and benefits that support people, and leaders who foster an open and inclusive culture.</li></ul><p><strong>When you apply&nbsp;</strong>Please include an up-to-date resume. We also strongly encourage you to include a cover letter explaining why you’re interested in working at Stack Overflow.</p><p><strong>What you’ll get in return:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Flexible hours</strong></li><li>20 days paid vacation + holidays</li><li>Completely free health insurance – no copay, no premiums (US residents)</li><li>Generous parental leave (10-16 weeks at 100% pay), family care leave, and unlimited sick days</li><li>Employees will never be poked with a sharp stick</li></ul><p><strong>If you want to work remotely.

Whether we’re helping developers get answers to their questions or find new jobs, we build products that affect millions of developers’ lives every day. Our goal is to create a community and a company where everyone feels welcome to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. We’re not there yet, which is why we’re hoping you’ll join us!</p><p>In this 11-week apprenticeship program, you’ll work directly alongside a developer mentor on a real product team. Rather than doing independent “intern” projects that may not ever ship, as an apprentice you’ll work with your mentor to learn, review, debug, and ship features to real users. You’ll also work collaboratively with other members of the team, including other developers, designers, and product managers.</p><p>Some recent projects we’ve been working on that you might contribute to:</p><ul></ul><li>Our newest products,&nbsp;&nbsp;and for&nbsp;, which give organizations a private, secure home for their team’s questions and answers.</li><a href='https://stackoverflow.com/teams' rel='nofollow'>Stack Overflow for Teams</a><a href='https://stackoverflow.com/enterprise' rel='nofollow'>Enterprise</a><li>New experiments on Stack Overflow&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;to help companies reach and engage developers with job and advertising opportunities.</li><a href='https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/talent' rel='nofollow'>Talent</a><a href='https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/engagement' rel='nofollow'>Engagement</a><li>Modifying the Ask a Question page and comments in order to make Stack Overflow easier to use and more welcoming to newcomers.</li><p>You’ll work primarily in our main tech stack of C#, ASP.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server. We don’t expect you to know those technologies coming in, so we’ll pair you with mentors who will help you learn and develop.</p><p>We’re a remote-first team, so you’ll have the option to work from home or out of our New York office. Wherever you work, you’ll be part of a remote work culture that emphasizes online communication (Trello, Slack, GitHub, Hangouts) and asynchronous collaboration wherever possible.</p><p></p><strong>Timing</strong><p>We are accepting applications on a rolling basis until the positions are filled for a target start date of&nbsp;. The duration of the apprenticeship will be 11 weeks.</p><strong>Tuesday, September 4th</strong><p></p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong><p></p><strong>What we’re looking for:</strong><ul></ul><li>&nbsp;. You may be new to programming, but you’re excited to learn and not afraid to ask questions!</li><strong>Eagerness to learn</strong><strong>and self motivation</strong><li>. For example, what you might have learned from having just completed a coding bootcamp or an undergraduate degree. You should have exposure to all parts of the stack: server-side web development, front-end JS/HTML/CSS, and some exposure to SQL.&nbsp;, but knowing some other web development framework will help you get up to speed more quickly (e.g. Node.js, Ruby-on-Rails).</li><strong>Intro-level web development skills</strong><em>You don’t have to be an expert in our stack</em><li>&nbsp;that you built which you can walk us through, whether it was something you built yourself in your spare time, as part of course work, or in a previous job or internship.</li><strong>An example project</strong><li>&nbsp;(especially if working remote), and comfort with communicating via chat and video calls. You’ll also need to have a quiet space free from interruptions where you’ll work.</li><strong>Great time-management skills</strong><p></p><strong>What you’ll get in return:</strong><ul></ul><li>Real-world dev experience on a top-notch team. If we’re hiring junior roles when you finish, you’ll be considered, but if not you’ll get great some experience to put on your resume.</li><li>Competitive compensation: $1770 / week in the US (ask us for the salary if you’re outside the US).</li><li>Flexible hours, as long as you make sure you can overlap with your mentor’s work schedule.</li><li>In the US, full employee benefits like health insurance and 401k matching.</li><li>Employees will never be poked with a sharp stick.</li><p>&nbsp;We’ll send you a laptop and equipment to help you be productive from wherever you work for the duration of the program.</p><strong>If you want to work remotely….</strong><p>You’ll enjoy additional benefits like free lunch every day prepared by our own in-house chefs, transportation reimbursement, and all the espresso you can drink.</p><strong>If you want to work in our office…&nbsp;</strong><p></p><strong>About Stack Overflow</strong><p>&nbsp;is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers.

We have an office in New York with some of the best amenities of any New York startup, and we have people who work remotely all over the world. &nbsp;We keep meetings and ceremony to an absolute minimum.</p><p></p><strong>What we value:</strong><ul></ul><li>: We lead by empowering and inspiring people to do their best work, not by micromanaging.

We believe each member is equally valuable, and we treat them as such. We are looking for a top-notch back end Architect who can make the important tech choices, be hands-on in developing those choices, and grow a small engineering team to assist. Initially, you will be wearing many hats as is typical in the start-up realm.<br /><br />You will be responsible for the Architecture, Roadmap, and Development of the application. Please note we are open to various technology platforms. The person we are looking for has a vast back end mobile application development experience and can guide us on best practices. Slot gaming knowledge is a strong plus, but it’s not necessary if you’re willing to learn. You must also be strongly self-directed, good at managing timelines, and good at working independently and as a team member as this is very collaborative.<br /><br />Our offices are located in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles – Remote work is fine.<br /><br />The Tech Stack<br />You get to influence this! Currently, we're thinking the back end will be in Java. <br />We're also considering Go, Rust, Python, Node.js, or even C# - if you can make a strong case as to why being locked into the Microsoft infrastructure is preferable. Come to us with strong opinions and a willingness to discuss engineering trade-offs.<br /><br /><br />Experience we are looking for:<br /><br />    You must have worked on back end projects deployed for iOS, Android, and/or both.<br /><br />    We want someone who has developed a mobile app and has been on a small team. Show us that you’ve had ownership of some part of a program you’ve worked on.<br /><br />    Start-up experience is really nice to have. Gaming experience is a plus.<br /><br />    It'd be nice if you've led a team in the past, as this position has the opportunity to grow into a managerial role as we grow the company.<br /><br />    You must have sysadmin / operations experience and be able to set up infrastructure for the app, preferably in a cloud context - systems, network, monitoring, security, etc. <br /><br />We plan on making a number of build-or-buy decisions so experience with integrating third-party tools and/or services is a plus.<br /><br />    Also a huge plus: experience scaling a consumer-facing service, particularly with respect to tuning for performance and reliability."

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Olo is revolutionizing the customer experience at these restaurant chains, and we're looking for talented engineers to join our team and help achieve this vision. As part of the team you will play a significant and visible role in helping us scale one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the market.

    "content": "*Location:* London<br /><br />*About Spektrix*<br />--<br />At Spektrix, we believe that entertainment experiences – whether theatre, sports, music and many more – improve the world in which we live. Our mission is to help make more of those experiences happen by transforming the way entertainment organisations sell tickets and build relationships with their audiences.<br /><br />Spektrix has grown considerably over the past few years, growing from 100 clients in the UK to over 300 both in the UK and North America. We sell over 20m tickets through our B2B SaaS platform. And we’re only just getting started.<br /><br />We’re bringing new clients on to the Spektrix platform weekly. This involves live migrations of millions of ticket sales (past and future), customer records and fundraising activities from their legacy systems into Spektrix.  We have built a reputation of making this migration process as smooth as possible for our clients, so that they can carry on with “business as usual” from their first day on Spektrix.<br /><br />*The job*<br />--<br />We are looking for a data migration engineer to join our data migration team. You will be leading data migration projects end to end while working closely with the rest of the data, techOps and implementation teams.<br /><br />You’ll work collaboratively with all stakeholders, including clients and our business team, to balance the client’s needs with delivering the project on time. You will occasionally visit clients and understanding their requirements will be part of your responsibility.<br /><br />You will develop and maintain the data importer to deliver improvements, include new functionality, improve efficiency and keep data integrity. You’ll be taking ownership of existing tools, as well as building from scratch when we come across systems we’ve never migrated from before.<br /><br />You’ll need to quickly get your head around the foreign data sets you’re provided with and use your problem solving skills to work out how to transform these into the Spektrix format. <br /><br />Working with others in your team to find the best solution, often times with lots of opinions, but no egos.<br /><br />We work innovatively, seeking new ideas and sharing new insights from blogs, conferences, and ultimately learning from mistakes! We learn through regular development talk sessions, held every couple of weeks.<br /><br />The role includes supporting our New York implementation team and North American clients, so the role has potential to develop to include travel and a permanent move to the US office.<br /><br />*Some of the technologies we use*<br />--<br />Our system is a multi-tenant, scalable SaaS platform. For data migrations we use the following technologies:<br /><br />* C# console applications<br />* SQL Server<br />* Powershell<br />* Full Convert<br />* JIRA / Trello / Confluence / Google Apps<br />* Stash (Git) Source Control / Bitbucket / Bamboo<br /><br />*What we're looking for*<br />--<br />* You will have strong SQL skills, whether that is from SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL or Postgres. Preferably with experience migrating data between different systems, platforms and database schemas.<br />* You can quickly analyse, understand and translate between vastly different implementations of common concepts.<br />* You will enjoy running projects from inception to delivery. You believe the best way to serving clients is by getting close to them.<br />* You are a great communicator, able to  explain complex processes both verbally and in writing. You have experience writing process or specification documentation.<br />* You are comfortable working to deadlines and have the ability to prioritise your workload to meet changing circumstances. You are able to concisely and efficiently communicate project progress and risks. You know who are your key stakeholders and what information they need.<br />* You will have an interest in the wider technical community, looking for ways to learn new  approaches to tackling complex problems as well as sharing your own story."

People don’t approach Art+Logic to churn out routine apps; they come because they have something hard, often requiring research and skilled implementation.&nbsp;There is no better place than Art+Logic for software developers to do what they love — and also better hone their craft.</em>”</p><p><br>Job Type: 1099, rates ranging $35-$50/hour<br>Travel: None Required - Work from Home<br>Location: United States and Canada only</p><p><strong>Find out more at:</strong></p><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://plus.google.coj/+ArtAndLogic' rel='nofollow'>https://plus.google.com/+ArtAndLogic</a></li><li><a href='http://www.artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>http://www.artandlogic.com/careers/</a></li></ul></ul><p><strong>Have more questions?</strong>&nbsp;Email us at <a href='mailto:Recruiting@artandlogic.com' rel='nofollow'>Recruiting@artandlogic.com</a></p><p>Some things are best said multiple times. <strong>Please note&nbsp;your interest in this specific position, when applying.&nbsp;</strong>(You can do so&nbsp;in the &quot;Brag&quot; section.)</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual Conference</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "
