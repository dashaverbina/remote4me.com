We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more, and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out.</p><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand distraction-free for multiple hours totally.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><p>We have partial test coverage, and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each release.</p><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><p>Developers get the super fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><p>If you did follow directions, our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code, and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><p>If we like your refactoring, we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. Nothing super in-depth CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard, you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><p><strong>Want more detail about the benefits?</strong></p><p>You can see a preview of TrainerRoad's health benefits here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27' rel='nofollow'>https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27</a></p><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><p>Right now!

Only under our exceptional system can people from all backgrounds and skill levels, from total beginner to semi-professional, compete in the game of pool and have fun.</p><p>Our offices&nbsp;are located in Lake Saint Louis, MO, right on the lake. We have a very relaxed atmosphere to work in&nbsp;and we&nbsp;believe in a healthy work/life balance. APA is a family owned and operated business and the sense of family is very strong given that the average tenure of our employees is 10+ years.</p><h2>About the Position:</h2><p>While the APA has&nbsp;used technology for decades, our in-house development team is just a couple of years old and we’re growing it slowly and methodically to ensure proper fit of everyone we ask to join our team. We have a mix of legacy(VB.Net/SOAP) and modern(C#/WebAPI, React/GraphQL/Meteor/Node.js) applications that need support and enhancement as well as a backlog of new applications that need to be built.</p><p>We are looking for full-stack or front-end developers who want to build modern, web based, mobile friendly apps that will enhance our customer experience and bring a modern and tech-savvy edge to the pool league industry. We are pushing the envelope for what our industry has seen in regard to customer experience and service. This position is for someone more skilled in Javascript (Node/Angular/React/Meteor) than .Net languages. Our tech team&nbsp;gets to choose the&nbsp;stack so&nbsp;open source languages such Ruby, Go, Erlang are a possibility for the right task.</p><h3>The technologies we use:</h3><ul><li><h4>Node.js, React, Meteor, GraphQL(Apollo)&nbsp;← This is what we're hiring for</h4></li><li>ASP VB.Net (legacy apps being supported while we retire them)</li><li>VB.Net Soap Services (legacy SOA tier being supported while we retire them)</li><li>C# WebAPI using EF, StructureMap (New Restful API)</li><li>SQL Server, Redis and Memcached (Data storage and caching)</li><li>Anything new that looks cool, sexy and can solve a need</li></ul><h3><span>Examples of existing projects and opportunities include:</span></h3><ul><li><span>Data-rich/responsive website for our customers with stats, schedules, standings, player profiles and social-media driven content</span></li><li><span>Opportunities to learn and use platforms like React/Node.js, Cordova/PhoneGap and XCode/Swift to develop and deliver mobile apps</span></li><li><span>Custom solutions for our International Tournaments held in Las Vegas (The World’s Largest according to Guinness World Records)</span></li><li><span>Electronic scoring and payment systems to take full advantage of the mobile-revolution</span></li><li><span>Work together with our back-end team to help add value to the support of our existing projects and make them shine</span></li></ul><h3><span>Key Responsibilities:</span></h3><ul><li><span>Have fun and work hard</span></li><li><span>Work closely with in-house team of Creative and Operational leaders to craft solutions and bring amazing ideas to fruition</span></li><li><span>Solve problems and deliver solutions with speed and grace</span></li><li>Be a team player and work on whatever project needs you (We are a small team where egos are not tolerated)</li></ul><h2><span>About You:</span></h2><p><span>You've been a software developer for a handful of years but what's really important to us is what you've learned and what you've done. You are aware of what you know and don't know, but that doesn't stop you from tackling the hard problems with great enthusiasm, actually the more impossible the task, the more determined you are to find a solution. However, you understand when to call for help, when to ditch an idea and pivot to something different. You know when to push back on a requirement and ask for more clarity. You stay current on tech. You love what you do and are passionate about creating great software (or at least you dream of being on a team that wants you to do so). You may have a Comp Sci degree, but you may just have stumbled into software development and found that you had a knack for it. You know your craft and you may have even squealed a little inside when the word &quot;craft&quot; was used to describe software development. You have worked on an Agile Development team before and understand Sprints, User Stories, and Story Point estimation.

    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Lead Code Whisperer with Rails and/or .NET experience </h2>      <h4>Posted Feb 14</h4>    <h3>      <span>Corgibytes, LLC</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: Richmond, VA</span><br>        <a href='http://corgibytes.com' rel='nofollow'>http://corgibytes.com</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>What Chip and Joanna do for houses, we do for code! We love finding fixer-upper apps that provide amazing business value but need some remodeling. We're also a women-owned business and 66% of our leadership team are women.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our main focus is on making software applications more stable, scalable, and secure. We call this &quot;software remodeling&quot; and we approach our work through the lens of these core values:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Act With Empathy</b><span>: Listening and understanding&nbsp;</span>is<span>&nbsp;at the very heart of our culture. Consider the people who are impacted by your work: your clients, your users, your teammates, and even your future self.</span><br></li><li><b>Adopt a Growth Mindset</b><span>: Constantly find ways to expand your knowledge and learn new things. Your intelligence and talent are not fixed; they're developed over time through perseverance, dedication, and hard work.</span><br></li><li><b>Calm the Chaos</b>: Urgency leads to errors; frenzy to frustration. We focus on developing the steady working rhythm and calm mind that works best for solving complex problems.</li><li><b>Communication is Just as Important as Code:</b> No one at Corgibytes identifies themselves as a “technical” or “non-technical” because everyone is both. Practice both types of skills regularly.</li><li><b>Craftsmanship in Context:</b> Match your solution to the situation. Sometimes it’s a quick and dirty prototype to prove a concept. When the stakes are high, spending extra time getting it right is the best way to go.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Sound like you? Awesome! That's a great sign because we live these values every day. They’re a guide in making decisions, no matter how small. They’ve helped us develop a culture where folks are autonomous, responsible, and work hard without feeling burned out or like they have to choose between family and work. We’re the type of company where it’s common to see a toddler bouncing on a knee during a meeting. As an intentionally distributed team, we focus more on results than micromanagement. Our core values are key to our culture, as are our pillars of autonomy, balance, diversity, </span>and<span>&nbsp;trust.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>What Corgibytes Does<br></b></div><div><span>There’s a lot of existing code out there that needs to be modernized safely. We specialize in this and have even coined a new term — software remodeling — to describe what we do. In general, we focus on activities that make software more stable, scalable, and secure, which can often blend traditional development with more DevOps and consulting activities (ex: teaching our clients how to write good acceptance tests using Gherkin). In general, we refactor, introduce or improve test coverage, break up monolithic apps, upgrade frameworks in any language, framework or platform. The best part for you? You'll get to solve lots of really interesting engineering challenges!</span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>About The Role<br></b></div><div><span>We've got some projects coming down the pike and we're looking for some seasoned full-stack developers who enjoy working with existing codebases to make them better. We're particularly looking for folks who have solid skills with Rails&nbsp;</span>and/or .<span>NET. This will be a contractor position and part-time is okay.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here's a question: does </span>reconstructing<span> a database from the binary files without any documentation sound like a fun challenge? If so, you've got the right attitude! Most of the folks on our team identify as &quot;menders&quot; (as opposed to makers). Given the choice, they'd rather fix bugs, pay down technical debt, and work on support tickets instead of doing exploratory features. Many of our clients come to us with complex architectural problems and can't find the talent anywhere else. As a Lead Code Whisperer, you can work directly with a client to help them migrate platforms, address security vulnerabilities, integrate with obscure systems, and more. You love a challenge and can understand and articulate the business value of technical choices.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If a project requires a stack you haven’t used before, your instinct is to become eager, not intimidated. You regularly practice writing clean code with Test-Driven Development and document your rationale. You stay up-to-date with industry best practices and maybe you're even starting to contribute your thoughts through blogs, StackOverflow, presentations, etc. You are a mentor who loves helping other developers grow in their careers. You enjoy pair programming and take pride in giving solid feedback through pull requests and code reviews.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><div><b><span>Salary &amp; Benefits<br></span></b></div><div><span>We're currently looking for 1-2 contractors to add to our team. Our current rate for contractors is&nbsp;</span><span>$74.48/hour, which might seem a little odd, but here's how we got at such a specific number.&nbsp;</span><span>We started with an annual salary of $110k/year. Next, we divided that by 1920 (48 weeks/year at 40 hours per week - we assume you’d take 4 weeks per year off) and add 30% to compensate for contractor expenses (using your own equipment, paying your own health insurance, self-employment taxes, etc.).</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Other benefits include:</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>Work where and when you want. We're a fully distributed team.&nbsp;</li><li>Lots of autonomy and self-organizing teams.</li><li>10% of your billable time accrues for professional development<br></li><li>Yoga/mindfulness classes</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>At this point, you're probably thinking something like, &quot;This job description really speaks to me, but I've never heard of Corgibytes. How do I know they're legit and learn more about them?&quot; No worries, my friend. We get that our business is a little under the radar as opposed to consumer apps, so here are some podcasts and articles you can check out to learn more about us and the work we do.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li><b>Software Engineering Daily&nbsp;</b>(https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/11/07/legacy-code-with-andrea-goulet/)<br></li><li><b>Hanselminutes&nbsp;</b>(https://www.hanselminutes.com/539/learning-to-love-legacy-code-with-andrea-goulet-from-corgibytes)</li><li><b>First Round Review&nbsp;</b>(http://firstround.com/review/forget-technical-debt-heres-how-to-build-technical-wealth/)</li><li><b>NASDAQ CTO Summit&nbsp;</b>(https://www.facebook.com/NASDAQ/videos/10154583234682429/)</li><li><b>LinkedIn Next Wave</b> - Our CEO, Andrea, was listed as one of the &quot;Top 10 Professionals in Software under 35&quot; (https://lists.linkedin.com/2016/next-wave-top-professionals-35-and-under-20161011#)</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We're really excited about the work we're doing.

We have a team of 8 developers who are very capable and committed (only one developer has left in the 12 years, and that was because he'd been offered a PhD placement). There are no office politics or any of that nonsense, it's a very collaborative environment. We try to keep quite a&nbsp;<em>flat</em>&nbsp;structure where we&nbsp;expect my developers to take responsibility for dealing with everything in their purview (with the CTO there as adviser if needed). This has allowed us to keep the team small and efficient.</p><p>Obviously with web-application development there's a reasonable amount of CRUD work, that's a given. But we have also developed interesting in-house tech of our own (distributed databases for document storage, natural language processing for clinical text parsing, UI frameworks, distributed config systems with PAXOS, language-ext, and echo-process, to name a few). We run on our own machines in high-security data-centres rather than on AWS/Azure, and so we have also developed our own in-house solutions for deployment, etc.</p><p>The people we need are 'self starters' and are happy to work on any part of the stack, from UI, to back-end, to data-centre automation, services etc. &nbsp;<strong>You must be prepared to develop code using the functional paradigm -&nbsp;this is super important, if you think Martin Fowler is a god, please don't apply. </strong></p><p>We need creatively minded individuals who can solve unique problems; not just with code problems, but in improving healthcare too. Healthcare professionals are often not very tech-savvy, and are therefore either scared or incapable of communicating with tech-people. So I need programmers than can hear a real world problem and think creatively and with empathy for the end user.</p><p>You should have significant C# and web-development experience (the web experience doesn't have to be with .NET, we use ASP.NET for our 'transport' mechanism only - we don't use any of the MS frameworks (other than the .NET BCL) -- they change so often, and when we started writing the app 12 years ago they were mostly awful). F# experience is useful but not essential. If you don't have F# experience, you will be expected to learn it and use it: we've been writing some of our satellite components in F#, and we want to use it more (the core application is C#, so that will give you time to get up to speed anyway).</p><p>If you know [Language-Ext](<a href='https://github.com/louthy/language-ext/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/louthy/language-ext</a>) (and understand why it exists) then that will help, as we use it throughout the application to bring robustness to our system. SQL Server is our primary database solution, so experience with that is essential - but we also use Postgres. If you have any Postgres experience that would be valuable.</p><p>We don't care about what degree you have (or don't have), but we do want to see experience and a passion for what you do. Github projects are the incredibly&nbsp;helpful for that. Written and spoken English must be good. And unfortunately until we know what is happening with Brexit: resident in the UK.</p><p>We offer a very attractive salary, employee profit sharing, and a relaxed working environment - working on proper technological solutions. You will not be forced/expected to work long hours as so often happens in software (in fact we actively discourage it). Remote working is also an option, most of the devs work remotely (but this must be after an initial in-office trial period of 3 months). &nbsp;Remote workers are expected to visit the office at least once per-month for the development team meeting, which is where the developers all get together to talk about interesting things (not always work related).</p><p><strong>No recruitment agencies / soliciting</strong></p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Significant experience in C# and evidence of a varied career in software development</p><p>Nice to have F# or any functional language experience</p><p>A willingness to use the functional language paradigm rather than OO</p><p>SQL Server / any relational database experience</p><p>Web application development experience</p><p>Outside interests that convey that you're a human being and not a robot!</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Medical Management Systems            </h2>            <div><p><em><strong>A collaborative and relaxed but professional and talented team</strong></em></p><p>We have a very relaxed working environment that is more akin to a start-up than a company that's been running for 12 years.

We know the code inside-out, so we can always help you</li><li>We've written 30+ codebases with just 2-3 developers on each one. We work in small teams (1-3 developers, 1 QA, 1 designer on each task)</li><li>You will have a healthy live-work balance. There are guys who joined our team in 2006 and have created numerous new products because&nbsp;they enjoy their work and the challenges are always interesting</li><li>We love working with like-minded people who enjoy software development</li></ul><p><strong><br>3. Our goal is to teach people how to compose great music</strong></p><p>About a month ago, we launched our new product called&nbsp;Captain Plugins. Magazine press and our fans loved it, so we have a wish list of&nbsp;hundreds of feature requests and ideas on what to build next.&nbsp;That is why we're hiring -- we have a lot of interesting work</p><p>Here's the YouTube video showing how the plugin works:</p><p><a title=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcyutjSZFlPpsgT0MPj6fFaa57EZo_Zhe&amp;v=7_OAh578qqA&quot; href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcyutjSZFlPpsgT0MPj6fFaa57EZo_Zhe&amp;v=7_OAh578qqA' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcyutjSZFlPpsgT0MPj6fFaa57EZo_Zhe&amp;v=7_OAh578qqA</a></p><p>One of the best testimonials we've gotten is that &quot;These plugins close the door on the past.&quot; They are a brand-new way to write music and create songs from scratch.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; requirements</strong></p><p>Our&nbsp;technology stack is based on .NET, using C#, AngularJS, TypeScript, Canvas, HTML5 + CSS3, SQL and more. If you're comfortable with WPF on desktop and HTML5/Canvas/MVC on web, you'll be able to read our code easily and develop new products</p><p><strong><br>What we require:</strong></p><p>1) Deep knowledge of the .NET stack</p><p>2) Natural curiosity for how things work</p><p>3) You&nbsp;taking a lot of initiative. This is part of the job requirement - we hire people who take initiative</p><p>4) You can work 4 days a week (Tuesday-Friday, or Monday-Thursday), or 5 days a week depending on your preference. We don't hire for less than 32 hours per week</p><p><strong>Send us an email</strong></p><p>We're not a big anonymous corporation, we're a small team of .NET developers who love making music tools.

We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines.
