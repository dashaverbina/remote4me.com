Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developers who want to add to Kibana and X-Pack?

We're looking for smart software engineers who &quot;get things done&quot;. We’re interested in remote candidates in the USA or candidates interested in working in our Reno office.</p><p>Areas of work include Xamarin iOS/OSX/Android, WPF, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core, Web API, HTML/Javascript, Angular2, Azure, DocumentDB, ANT&nbsp;sport&nbsp;devices, Bluetooth Smart&nbsp;sport&nbsp;devices, Build/Test integration, and SQL among others.</p><p>We're looking to hire&nbsp;three engineers to expand our web team. Inside of that team people usually focus on one of the following areas:</p><p>Backend Development - Controllers, API, Services, Azure data stuff, Integrations, etc</p><p>Frontend Development - Angular2, API, Controllers</p><p>TrainerRoad handles a large amount of data and our site gets a lot of use by a set of passionate users. On the backend, you might enqueue millions of items to process via Azure Functions or WebJobs (quickly and efficiently).&nbsp; On the frontend, you'll be writing code that handles&nbsp;multiple requests per second.</p><p>What I'm saying is your code will matter.</p><p>We've also got a crack design team. They make it so engineers never have to write a single line of CSS!</p><p>Note: We're not on ASP.NET Core yet but we'll move there as soon as EF catches up with our requirements.</p><p><strong>Who&nbsp;We're Looking For</strong></p><p>We want smart engineers! The ideal candidate&nbsp;is a &quot;developer's developer&quot; and enjoys reading about programming in their free time, tinkering on the weekends with side projects and staying abreast of the latest frameworks/technologies in their area of expertise.</p><p>We basically want someone with a passion for development.</p><p><strong>Required Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>C# Experience - Intermediate to Advanced&nbsp;proficiency</li></ul><p><strong>Optional Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>ASP.net MVC</li><li>ASP.net Core</li><li>Javascript Frameworks (Angular2,&nbsp;React,&nbsp;etc)</li><li>LINQ</li><li>Web API</li><li>Azure</li><li>DocumentDB</li><li>SQL</li><li>HTML</li><li>Build/Test CI (We use TeamCity)</li></ul><p><strong>Work Remote or in Reno, Nevada</strong></p><p>We're looking for the best candidate we can find in the US. Over half of our development&nbsp;team works remotely. It works very well with the help of Slack and Github.</p><p>We expect remote employees&nbsp;to overlap at least 6 hours with the Reno, Nevada office (we're there 8am-5pm Pacific time).</p><p><strong>Salary</strong></p><p>We're looking to hire engineers for&nbsp;100k/year. &nbsp;If you ask for more we'll reject your application.

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to actually have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements everything else works itself out.</p><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand totally distraction free for multiple hours.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><p>We have partial test coverage and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each release.</p><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><p>Developers get the super fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><p>If you did follow directions our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><p>If we like you're refactoring we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. &nbsp;Nothing super deep CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Trainer Road, LLC            </h2>            <div><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive Pay</li><li>Unlimited Vacation</li><li>401k with 4% company matching&nbsp;</li><li>99% of employees individual health care paid</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>Access to the latest fitness devices (power meters, trainers, sensors, etc.)</li></ul>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Unlimited Vacation                            </div>                            <div>                                 99% of Employee Health Insurance Paid                            </div>                            <div>                                 Fitness Minded Culture                            </div>                            <div>                                 401k with 4% matching                            </div>                    ",

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to actually have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><br><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><br><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><br><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><br><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><br><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><br><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><br><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><br><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><br><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><br><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><br><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><br><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><br><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements everything else works itself out.</p><br><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><br><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><br><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand totally distraction free for multiple hours.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><br><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><br><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><br><p>We have partial test coverage and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><br><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each release.</p><br><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><br><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><br><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><br><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><br><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><br><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><br><p>Developers get the super fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><br><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><br><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><br><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><br><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><br><p>If you did follow directions our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><br><p>If we like you're refactoring we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. &nbsp;Nothing super deep CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><br><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><br><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><br><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><br><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><br><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><br><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><br><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><br><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><br><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.</p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

As the market leader for field service supply chain solutions in the UK, we rely on our software team to innovate and build new solutions, as well as developing our existing systems, keeping ByBox ahead of the competition and reinforcing our position as a successful innovator within UK field support.</p><p>We are also successfully re-positioning ourselves as a global technology provider for locker delivery solutions, predominantly focussing on the field service supply chain. This is an exciting departure from the previous market position as a distribution company with a strong technology capability. This change of position is allowing us to operate a different revenue model, through software subscriptions and licensing, rather than through logistics services.</p><p>To support this, the software development department must deliver the correct short and long-term projects to enable that re-positioning.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>As a Software Development Manager at ByBox your duties include:</p><p>Leadership. Lead, motivate and influence a team of expert software developers to deliver value for ByBox while ensuring software quality. Ensure the developers have all the tools they need, be it hardware, software, or training, to do their job to the required level.</p><p>Relationships. Work closely with colleagues in the software development department to ensure the development team are aligned to business priorities and strategy. Develop strong relationships with internal customers to understand their perspectives and to positively influence the reputation of software development.</p><p>Recruitment. Take a highly pro-active role in the recruitment of software developers. Work with the ByBox recruitment team to ensure the highest-quality candidates are identified and engaged effectively. Also, engage with external organisations to seek the right talent and to promote ByBox as a forward-thinking employer of software developers.</p><p>Resourcing. Work closely with the Business Interface Manager and Project Managers to ensure the right developers are available at the right time for delivering the Software Development Pipeline. Where necessary, own the relationship with outsourced-development teams and the process for bringing on additional software developers on a temporary-contract basis. Ensure the software developers are appropriately assigned to projects, and given opportunities to work on other projects as required and fairly. Respond to business needs through the appropriate deployment of developers, while protecting long-term contingency in capacity so we can quickly respond to opportunities.</p><p>People development. Develop and retain our people by fostering a positive environment for personal and professional development through continuously engaging with developers, appraisals, objectives and training plans. Provide a platform for developers to raise concerns or offer new ideas, support one another, and resolve conflict, and where necessary manage performance or disciplinary concerns. Promote and develop the key values from our Ways of Working, including innovation, trust and openness.</p><p>Continuous improvement. Drive continuous improvement and adoption of best practices within the software development team to optimize the performance of the team. By pragmatically weighing the business need for delivery with the need to keeping technology current, help to ensure the team is producing the right solution at the right time.</p><p>Documentation. Define and own the good practice for technical documentation, demos, and handovers amongst the team for the benefit of colleagues, and customers requiring technical API documentation.</p><p>Technology. Support your team in ensuring they are abreast of the latest developments in technologies, and they have the tools they need to adopt appropriate technology. Be familiar with the current technologies in your team, and be aware of upcoming technologies. You do not need to be the technology expert within your team, but must be able to articulate the pros and cons of competing technologies and justify investment to senior management.</p><p>Quality Assurance. Work very closely with the Quality Assurance Manager to ensure QA practices are aligned across the department, particularly in the adoption of Test Automation and the Test Automation Engineers reporting to the QA Manager.</p><p>Workload. Manage your own objectives and priorities effectively and without close supervision. Although you won't be directly managing the work of your direct reports (this will be done by Software Project Managers), a good awareness of their current work will be crucial in making good decisions. You will be able to escalate issues to the Head of R&amp;D and will also be required to make recommendations. You will also be involved in the technology strategy by supporting the Head of R&amp;D with departmental planning activities as required.</p><p><strong>The Person</strong></p><p>The Software Development manager does not need to be currently active in writing code, and the role does not entail any code-writing, but there is room for a successful candidate to define the level of their technical involvement, based on their knowledge. The ideal candidate will:</p><ul><li>Have a passion for Technology and good understanding of trends in Software Development.</li><li>Have a strong technical foundation in Software Development.</li><li>Embrace a cross-functional approach to team management and appreciate the challenges therein.</li><li>Foster an open, collaborative environment, and balance people's needs with company objectives.</li><li>Appreciate the challenges of managing a team of home-workers, and home-working yourself.</li><li>Understand how to lead and manage a team of highly talented, distributed Software Developers.</li></ul><p><strong>Essential qualifications and experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Team Leadership or Management, particularly teams of Software Developers</li><li>Technical background.</li><li>Worked with home-working or distributed teams.</li><li>Management of outsourced development partners.</li><li>Excellent command of written and spoken English.</li></ul><p><strong>Desirable qualifications and experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience working in a team of primarily .Net &amp; JavaScript developers.</li><li>Experience in the logistics industry.</li><li>Knowledge of the ByBox domain</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About ByBox            </h2>            <div><p>ByBox is leading the way in box-based logistics.

While these are required as foundational languages, being the first and primary developer for the projects you will be working on, you can enjoy the flexibility of working with any framework. We’re flexible, so even if you primarily work with C# or any other languages, but have experience developing web applications, send us your CV! :)</p><p>Although based in Australia, Avant8 has presence in the US and leverages it to deal with domestic brands and investors, specializing in turning around their distressed digital assets. Our team creates innovative solutions that work well under pressure allowing for new business models to tested rapidly in any market.</p><p>We’re looking for A-players, and part of that involves autonomy. You will be assigned tasks, both small and large, and a general time frame, but given the autonomy and freedom to schedule your own daily tasks as long as you complete what needs to get done. We understand and respect that you know development better than we do and it’s not our place to call unnecessarily strict or irrational deadlines and ways of completing tasks. This may be a good place to add that you should, when applying, mention in the cover letter your favorite food and, if you’re feeling ambitious, include a picture: this is to weed out applicants who mindlessly apply en masse to listings.</p><p>Given the above mentioned autonomy and freedom, you will be expected to debrief with a daily summary of what was accomplished, problems you ran into, what’s planned for the coming days, and maybe a joke or two. :)</p><p>We are a fun, friendly, and closely knit team, and although geographically distant, we have a strong work ethos and communicate regularly allowing for a very friendly and efficient work environment. Being a part of a new division within an established company, you get the best of both worlds in terms of job security and company culture. We work hard and expect the same from all of our team members.</p><p>We work hard, but we also play hard. You should come with a great sense of humor and a smile on your face, because you’ll have a few laughs and enjoy your time working with us. We reward hard work with a variety of perks incorporated in our flexible working environment.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Avant8 Pty Ltd            </h2>            <div><p>We are Australia-based Avant8 Pty Ltd. and we are looking for a motivated full-stack developer to join a new sector in our company that focuses on building digital assets in high trafficked industries, including but not limited to medical (health, wellness), finance, and social.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote working                            </div>                    ",

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developers who want to add to Kibana and X-Pack?

We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything in this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!</p><p>As a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry. You will help us shape the digital guest experience for restaurant brands served by Olo.

Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.</p><p>We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller.  We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!). Check out our culture map.</p><p>Olo is an equal opportunity employer and diversity is valued at our company. All applicants receive consideration for employment.
