We know the code inside-out, so we can always help you</li><li>We've written 30+ codebases with just 2-3 developers on each one. We work in small teams (1-3 developers, 1 QA, 1 designer on each task)</li><li>You will have a healthy live-work balance. There are guys who joined our team in 2006 and have created numerous new products because&nbsp;they enjoy their work and the challenges are always interesting</li><li>We love working with like-minded people who enjoy software development</li></ul><p><strong><br>3. Our goal is to teach people how to compose great music</strong></p><p>About a month ago, we launched our new product called&nbsp;Captain Plugins. Magazine press and our fans loved it, so we have a wish list of&nbsp;hundreds of feature requests and ideas on what to build next.&nbsp;That is why we're hiring -- we have a lot of interesting work</p><p>Here's the YouTube video showing how the plugin works:</p><p><a title=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcyutjSZFlPpsgT0MPj6fFaa57EZo_Zhe&amp;v=7_OAh578qqA&quot; href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcyutjSZFlPpsgT0MPj6fFaa57EZo_Zhe&amp;v=7_OAh578qqA' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLcyutjSZFlPpsgT0MPj6fFaa57EZo_Zhe&amp;v=7_OAh578qqA</a></p><p>One of the best testimonials we've gotten is that &quot;These plugins close the door on the past.&quot; They are a brand-new way to write music and create songs from scratch.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; requirements</strong></p><p>Our&nbsp;technology stack is based on .NET, using C#, AngularJS, TypeScript, Canvas, HTML5 + CSS3, SQL and more. If you're comfortable with WPF on desktop and HTML5/Canvas/MVC on web, you'll be able to read our code easily and develop new products</p><p><strong><br>What we require:</strong></p><p>1) Deep knowledge of the .NET stack</p><p>2) Natural curiosity for how things work</p><p>3) You&nbsp;taking a lot of initiative. This is part of the job requirement - we hire people who take initiative</p><p>4) You can work 4 days a week (Tuesday-Friday, or Monday-Thursday), or 5 days a week depending on your preference. We don't hire for less than 32 hours per week</p><p><strong>Send us an email</strong></p><p>We're not a big anonymous corporation, we're a small team of .NET developers who love making music tools.

Our software allows healthcare providers and patients to make better decisions faster. We're looking for talented software engineers to join our team in solving some of the most difficult problems in HIE.</p><p>CareEvolution's stack has been selected as the technical infrastructure for seven statewide exchanges in the US. We also have other large public and private exchange networks, as well as health plan exchanges in active deployment.</p><p>Our team is quite small, but all of us are technical people. We maintain a strong start-up/hacker culture. CareEvolution has partnered with a few large companies with relationships in all 50 states - and beyond - to supply a large portion of our sales and marketing efforts. &nbsp;Our stack is recognized by leading HIE industry analysts as the most technologically sophisticated HIE on the market - by a significant margin. &nbsp;Mention the word sesquipedalian in your employment application to have it processed quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>We are focused and execute very quickly. But we also have a lot of fun - biweekly visits to the bar, daily ping pong/foosball/darts games in the office, hackathons every eight weeks for pet projects, biannual company-wide get-togethers, board game nights, rock climbing nights, disc golf days... etc. We are also a very family-friendly organization. We have constant, active teleconference for all of our remote employees <strong>(all remote people must live somewhere in the US or Canada)</strong> - which comprise more than half of the CareEvolution team.</p><p>Check out our company page to the right,&nbsp;and visit <a title=&quot;http://letsfixhealthcare.com&quot; href='http://letsfixhealthcare.com' rel='nofollow'>http://letsfixhealthcare.com</a> for more information on what we do.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Management-less environment                            </div>                            <div>                                 Work from anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 Competitive Salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 401K &amp; Defined Benefit                            </div>                            <div>                                 Strong Partnerships                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flex Time                            </div>                            <div>                                 Hackathons every 8 weeks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Talented coworkers                            </div>                            <div>                                 Biweekly post-work get-togethers                            </div>                            <div>                                 This work actually matters                            </div>                    ",

And a track record to prove it.<br /><br />*OUR CULTURE?*<br /><br />Tech-savvy, innovative, entrepreneurial, collaborative. Our consultants are fiercely loyal and this is borne out by a very low attrition rate.<br /><br />*WHAT DOES A TYPICAL DAY LOOK LIKE?*<br /><br />* Imagine owning the proof of concept, design, architecture, development and delivery of client solutions.<br />* Imagine engaging with developers, business analysts, change professionals, project managers and other stakeholders.<br />* Imagine being the face of the firm, showcasing solutions, outlining benefits, identifying future business opportunities.<br />* Imagine using your business acumen to ensure technical implementations are fit for purpose.<br /><br />*WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE ROLE?*<br /><br />In many ways you will feel like your own boss.

The role will bring lots of autonomy and flexibility including a significant opportunity for remote working.<br /><br />*WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES?*<br /><br />If you enjoy the formal structure of a corporate environment then this is not for you. You will need be self-motivated and versatile enough to wear multiple hats i.e. consultant, project manager, business analyst, technician, mentor, advisor.

In many ways progression will be exactly what you make it.<br /><br />*WHAT TECHNICAL SKILLS WILL I NEED?*<br /><br />* Programming background in .NET, Java, C# or similar.<br />* An understanding of object-orientated, structured development methodologies.<br /><br />*WHAT BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE WILL I NEED?*<br /><br />* Good understanding of project management, software development life cycles, structured programming methods and controls.<br />* An affinity for consulting, business analysis, change management, process re-engineering, business transformation.<br />* Prior experience of designing and implementing documented, supportable and extensive developments for clients.<br />* Able to solve business and technical challenges by using innovative and well-planned approaches.<br /><br />*SOFT SKILLS?*<br /><br />* Highly personable, engaging, client-facing, confident, credible, articulate, consultative, affable, charismatic.<br />* Gravitas and credibility to face off to senior business stakeholders, able to instil confidence.<br />* Sixth sense for identifying, troubleshooting and remediating issues, both business and technical.<br />* Sound commercial nous coupled with excellent stakeholder management skills and a strong technical background.<br />* Able to tailor a message to the audience, combined with exceptional presentation skills.<br />* International outlook and exposure, you will most likely have worked abroad at some point.<br />* Bilingual Japanese/English skills are essential.<br /><br />*THE NUMBERS?*<br /><br />JPY 12,000,000 + excellent benefits + share options.<br /><br />*INTERESTED?*<br /><br />Please apply including a copy of your CV and cover letter (yes we're a bit old school like that). We look forward to hearing from you.",
