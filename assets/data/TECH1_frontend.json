The ideal person will have solid HTML, CSS and JS skills and be able to craft delightful user experiences in a scalable way.<br><br>This is a position on our design team, which means you will have a big say in how we architect the design system that powers all of our app's UI and UX. With that in mind, we are looking for someone who can do more than just re-create a mockup – We're looking for someone who can think critically and help us create better experiences for our users, while working closely with our full stack developers who are creating the core business logic.<br><br><strong>The kind of work we do</strong><br>BriteCore is essentially a CMS for insurance companies. They use it to manage all aspects of their business, including tracking policies, contacts and handling claims.<br><br>This means our users typically see our app more as a business tool like Microsoft Word or Google Sheets than a website (even though it is completely a web app). They also are using BriteCore for several hours every day, and are concerned with doing things quickly and efficiently. This, along with the complicated nature of insurance, means we deal with some complex workflows, and try to set ourselves apart from our competitors with a smooth UX that helps them navigate these tough processes.<br><br><strong>What you might be doing</strong><br>We're looking for someone who can really help us take our frontend system to the next level, and this includes things like:</p><ul><li>Creating, in collaboration with designers, a modular, scalable design system that can be used by other developers to quickly and consistently build out new features.</li><li>Implementing a robust hotkey system, to allow our users to quickly accomplish tasks in the app.</li><li>Help us implement better user analytics, and eventually allow us to A/B test new features/designs.</li></ul><p><br><strong>What it is like to work here</strong><br>BriteCore is a remote-first company — even employees who live in our home city of Springfield, MO usually work from home!

The bulk of my work is with reputable design firms so there is a very high standard WRT front-end implementation.</p><p>Project ownership depends on what we're both comfortable with, either giving you full ownership with my oversight or tag-teaming and you keep track of hours.</p><p>Ideally looking for someone in Toronto for the occasional meetup, but open to folks from other locations.

In a world where we live with devices that last only a few months or a few years maybe, where we buy stuff to throw it away only days or weeks later, the term ‘effort’ gains a new meaning.</p><p>Recently, I was reading <a href='https://www.kinoyoga.com/yogi-assignment-yatnah-effort/' rel='nofollow'>an essay on ‘Yatnah’</a>, ‘Effort’. I spent a lot of time outside in nature in the past weeks and created a small acre to grow some vegetables. I also attended a workshop to learn the craft of grafting fruit trees. When you cut a tree, you realize that our fast-living, short-term lifestyle is very different from how nature works. I grafted a tree that is supposed to grow for decades now, and if you cut a tree that has been there for forty years, it’ll take another forty to grow one that will be similarly tall.</p><p>I’d love that we all try to <strong>create more long-lasting work</strong>, software that works in a decade, and in order to do so, put effort into learning how we can make that happen. So long, I’ll leave you with this quote and a bunch of interesting articles.</p><blockquote>“In our modern world it can be tempting to throw effort away and replace it with a few phrases of positive thinking. But there is just no substitute for practice”.<br><br>— Kino Macgregor</blockquote>      <div>      <div>    <p>Getting the process <em>just</em> right ain't an easy task.

We all love new design tools, and new ones such as Sketch, Figma, Xd, or Invision Studio keep popping up. But despite these tools solving a lot of common problems and making some things easier, productivity is mostly about what works for your problem and not what is newest.

Finally, a better alternative to the much used Google DNS servers, it is available under <code>1.1.1.1</code>. The new DNS is the fastest, and probably one of the most secure ones, too, out there. Cloudflare put a lot of effort into encrypting the service and partnering up with Mozilla to make DNS over HTTPS work to close a big privacy gap that until now leaked all your browsing data to the DNS provider.</li><li>I heard a lot about iOS machine learning already, but despite the interesting fact that they’re able to do this on the device without sending everything to a cloud, I haven’t found out how to make use of this for apps, yet.

However, advertisers have found a way to track users with HSTS and using it as a persistent cross-site identifier (known as “super cookie”). <a href='https://webkit.org/blog/8146/protecting-against-hsts-abuse/' rel='nofollow'>The WebKit developers reacted now</a>, and in order to protect the privacy of their users, they weakened the reliability of HSTS by limiting the hostname scope and ignoring an HSTS state for subresource requests to blocked domains.</li><li>PagerDuty just published an <a href='https://sudo.pagerduty.com/for_everyone/' rel='nofollow'>open-source version of their internal security training material</a>, full of interesting and easy to understand explanations about common security issues and strategies.

Tim Kadlec took it as a trigger to revisit it. He now concludes that <a href='https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2018-03-22-compressive-images-revisited/' rel='nofollow'>we should not use the compressive image technique anymore</a> because of its big memory footprint and rely on new responsive image technologies such as the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element or <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes instead.</li><li>Eric Portis shares the under-the-hood principles of the <code>w</code> descriptors and <code>sizes</code> attribute for images.

    "content": "<p>Part-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><p>Hi, we’re GMB, and we teach people how to use their bodies better.</p><p>The word “fitness” has been perverted to mean doing things you hate to impress people you don’t like with a body that’s too tired and sore to do anything fun. We’re here to change that, and we need your help.</p><p>We started out in 2010 with an email subscription form, a YouTube account, and a lot of scrambling to figure things out. Even with over 40,000 clients in 80 countries, pretty much everything about how we’ve built our company and marketed our products has been bootstrapped by a small group of deeply invested people wearing a lot of hats and learning as we went along. Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</p><p>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and <strong>we are looking for a Front-End WP Developer to join GMB, part-time to start</strong>. You’ll be part of a team that is helping to imagine and build new products — as well as improve existing ones.</p><h2>What will be your responsibilities?</h2><ul><li>Working directly with our graphic designer to bring new design to code</li><li>Update and improve existing front-end code</li><li>Potential to work on the next version of our app and be involved in styleguide and UI library creation</li></ul><h3>To do this job, you will need:</h3><ul><li>Experience bringing WordPress themes to code (HTML/CSS/JS)</li><li>Some sense or experience in UX design</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end tools (Gulp, Sass, etc.)</li><li>Experience using git and GitHub workflows</li><li>Familiarity with CSS methodology (SMACSS, BEM, etc.)</li><li>Bonus points for some back-end and API familiarity especially with regard to WordPress</li></ul><h3>Other Requirements &amp; Competencies</h3><ul><li>You’ve been following GMB for a while and understand what sets us apart from other fitness companies.</li><li>You are clear on the value you’ll bring to the team.</li><li>You know how to follow instructions and how to be creative – and how to choose between them.</li><li>You speak and read/write perfect English.</li><li>You have a sense of humor.</li><li>You always work to develop a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>.</li><li>You are good at self-managing.</li><li>You have a strong DIY ethic – know what you don’t know and what you can do about it.</li><li>You can make things happen. You are a doer/maker as well as a planner.</li><li>You can manage written communication with a lot of different people.</li></ul><p>Compensation is competitive and commensurate with experience, but you can get a pretty good sense of our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits and such here</a>.</p><h2>What’s it like working at GMB?</h2><p>GMB is a kick-ass company.</p><p>GMB is about creating autonomy. We’re working to make the world a better place by teaching people to take control of what their bodies can do so they can contribute to their families and communities. We create options for exploration and self-expression.</p><p>And we work the way we practice. Like our idea of fitness and the way we deliver our programs, very little about the way we work is like what you’d find in a traditional company. Here’s how we exemplify autonomy at work:</p><p>&nbsp;<span>Work and Live Anywhere</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Set Your Own Schedule.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Create Your Own Role.</span></p><p>We also take care of our people. Building a great team with full autonomy requires more than just freedom; we thrive in an environment that supports development and growth… and we bet you will too. Some of the things we value and encourage are:&nbsp;<span>continuous learning</span>,&nbsp;<span>travel &amp; facetime</span>, as well as&nbsp;<span>time off</span>. Learn more about all our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits here</a>.</p><p>If you like what you’ve read so far, familiarize yourself with who we are and what we’re&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>about</a>&nbsp;before going any further. You should also listen to this interview with Andy about&nbsp;<a href='https://mixergy.com/interviews/gmb-fitness-with-andy-fossett/' rel='nofollow'>how we grew GMB</a>&nbsp;and what’s important to us.</p><p>Want to learn more about the smart, fun people you’ll be working with? Check out our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/team/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>.</p><h2>How To Apply</h2><p>If you’re thinking, “I know how to use an APP; I’d be great at this,” you’re probably wrong. Please read everything above&nbsp;<em>carefully</em>&nbsp;and make sure you understand that there are some fairly complex and technical requirements.</p><p>If that all sounds like stuff you can handle, we’d love to hear from you. Please click on the link below, fill in the form at the bottom of the page, and make a case for why you’ll be a great fit for the team.</p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

We deliver products, solutions and platforms built using blockchain technology to transform how business is done in complex network of buyers, suppliers and consumers.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, the music industry, security, and infrastructure, and more. To accomplish this we've built out a flat organizational structure which we call the ConsenSys Mesh: a network of individuals &amp; teams working autonomously and towards the same goal.  Our mission is to use these decentralized solutions to fundamentally reshape the economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us.</p><p>About the role:<br>We are currently seeking a Design System Lead with a passion for the designer and developer experiences in the Ethereum ecosystem. Realizing a decentralized future depends on the mass adoption and use of applications built on Ethereum, so we are focused on making the experience of building an application as easy as possible—with the highest quality results.</p><p>Teams, internally and eventually externally, need a way to quickly prototype decentralized applications (dApps) and validate their ideas. As product designers across the organization learn and experiment, we need a way to aggregate best practices around interactions specific to blockchain. The Design System Lead will drive the vision and grow a team to research, build, and iterate upon a design system to serve internal teams and, in the future, the broader Ethereum community.</p><p>As the Design System Lead is responsible for the visual and technical direction of the Design System, this will require both product and project management skills, in addition to a deep understanding of design and front-end development. The ideal candidate will design a complete systems life-cycle, from establishing a practice and vision that endures to design, build, document, and maintain a library used by many product teams.</p><p>Responsibilities:<br>Lead: Lead the visual and technical direction of the experience design, visual style, and technical tooling, with input from peers from product design and development teams.<br>Build a team: Plan for and grow a design system team of front-end developers and designers. Identify and nurture team growth and culture, identifying opportunities for team members to drive and lead system aspects.<br>Research: Identify strategic teams/groups for design system consumption and align research activity to assess efficacy of system concerns. Anticipate edge cases and support recommendations with solid research and end-user testing.<br>Measure: Verify and improve on designs contributed to the design system through reviews, usability testing, and alignment to established patterns and standards.<br>Identify, monitor, and report on system use across the company and community.<br>Evangelize: Present the system’s mission, library, and process to internal and external groups. Fearlessly take on highly complex problem areas and publish what you learn.<br>Manage: Facilitate regular team scrum and sprint planning sessions. Clarify scope to balance delivering minimum useful functionality with properly scalable system design. Deliver system releases at a predictable cadence.</p><p>Requirements:<br>You have led, built, and/or maintained a design system, evidenced in an online portfolio<br>You are passionate about accessibility and localization<br>Previous experience working with UI frameworks like Angular, React, VUE, Ember, etc.<br>Experience working with remote designers and engineers<br>You demonstrate product vision and use data and experimentation to provide product direction.<br>You understand customer experience and the relationship between brand and product design<br>You’re excellent at articulating design decisions, presenting to clients or stakeholders<br>You’re effective at prototyping at varying levels of fidelity<br>You demonstrate solid leadership skills and an ability to develop strong partnerships<br>Agile, adaptable, and capable of iteration and collaboration across many disciplines</p><p>Even better if:<br>You’re interested in or have experience with decentralized applications and blockchain<br>You’re interested in or have experience designing for platforms, working within an open source community or project, and/or developer tools<br>You enjoy some amount of ambiguity and freedom to experiment<br>You have front-end development experience<br>You enjoy writing and public speaking to share your ideas</p></div>",

    "content": "Bikmo is an adventure sports technology company, with a simple mission to provide exceptional services that enable our customers to spend more time exploring the great outdoors.<br /><br />Focussing initially on insurance in the cycling sector, we're now live in the UK, Ireland, Germany and Austria and by utilising sector expertise, technology, a love for the sport and an open approach to data, we've won customers, partners, awards and 5-star reviews.<br /><br />We are searching for a technically excellent and self-starting full stack developer to join our CTO in developing the platform that will enable us to achieve this ambition. Rapid application development allows us to adapt to our customers' needs and stay one step ahead of the competition, so we're looking for an applicant with an agile and adaptive mind.<br /><br />Our ideal candidate would be one who has as much energy for adventure sports as they do coding - you can live and work in the heart of the Alps, the UK or where you choose.<br /><br />The role:<br /><br />You will be working on a number of existing applications, and aiding with the creation of new application as and when they are needed. Our applications use middleware stacks to allow efficient re-use of encapsulated code, and the rapid development and deployment of new systems and feature sets. As a startup, we are moving at a rapid pace and the successful candidate will need to be able to get up to speed quickly and work self-sufficiently.<br /><br />In our back-end work we follow PHP-fig standards where they apply. We check our code for 'mess' and standards before sharing with remote repos and other projects. We use the git-flow branching strategy, and code review via pull-request.<br /><br />In our front-end work we build templates in Twig which can be integrated into existing and new PHP server-side projects. Developers need to have a good understanding of how data can be provided from and delivered to the back-end application, through template rendering, form submission and API interaction. They need to be able to use composition and inheritance to implement an effective, efficient templating strategy.<br /><br />Valuable experience of using JS, and JQuery where appropriate, is essential to any of our front-end work. The developer should be able to manipulate the DOM to provide an exceptional user experience, and use application logic to interact with the back end application on-page.<br /><br />Benefits:<br /><br />This role is a full time role at 38 hours per week, Monday to Friday.<br /><br />The Bikmo HQ is based in Chester, but you do not need to be. Everyone in the Bikmo team works remotely to some degree. We also have offices in Innsbruck and Munich which you are welcome to work in.<br /><br />It will be highly beneficial to spend the initial phase of your employment sitting side-by-side with our CTO Jorj, in order to get to grips with our existing systems, our roadmap, and our working expectations. This can either be done at one of our offices, or, potentially, at your work environment if it's more practical for Jorj to spend time there instead.<br /><br />As a growing business, our benefit structure is under review and will include a share options scheme and holiday entitlement boost.<br /><br />Holiday is pro rata at 28 days per year, inclusive of bank holidays. You get an additional day of leave for your birthday and may take 1 day per month for riding adventures / 12 days per year - in return for content for our magazine.<br /><br />Your application:<br /><br />Please include a bit about you/your CV of LinkedIn profile and answers to the following questions with your application;<br /><br />1. Talk about your preferred development environment: computer, software, and office.<br />2. What did you learn this week?<br />3. What is at the top of your riding (cycling, snowboarding, etc.) bucket-list?",

But we’re even prouder of the fact that we’re a platform that serves developers, and we’re helping them build their own complex business process applications that require extensive forms and APIs to support them. No other platform provides developers the tools that we provide them.</p><p>We are growing rapidly, and have more work and opportunities than we have people to accomplish them. That’s where you come in!</p><p>If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have extensive experience with Javascript on *both* the front end and the back end. You’re excited about all the new technologies coming down the pike like typescript, angular 5, vue, ES2018 and are a super quick study. This isn’t your first rodeo. You’ve got 5 or more years of experience, and can point to multiple apps or sites you have helped ship.</p><p>That’s a really quick intro of what we are looking for but first you need to know what it is like working for us.</p><h5>A little about us</h5><p>We’re an early-stage company that provides our customers a powerful and unique combined Form and API platform designed specifically for developers!We have something that no-one else has, and we’ve achieved significant traction in the market and adoption byenterprises all over the world, ranging from startups, SMBs, to large enterprises, who operate in a wide range of business verticals including healthcare, education, government agencies, insurance, banking and financial services, legal, online retail, industrial, compliance, agricultural, software agencies, and many others. We are fully funded, have been cash flow positive for a while, and are rapidly growing our MRR revenue without needing to search for new investment capital.</p><p>We love building tools that make data collection and management easier for developers building web apps. As part of that we’ve developed tons of front end and back end components and tools in many frameworks and technologies.</p><h5>Who you’d be working with</h5><p>Our team is is small, tightly knit, and highly collaborative group of contributors. We are headquartered in Dallas, TX, but we have several remote developers as well, and we work very well over remote by utilizing conference and chatroom tools.</p><p><strong>Travis</strong> - the founding father and CTO of Form.io leads the team with technology insight and vision, combined with the powerful ability to roll up his sleeves and dive deep into the code with any issue. Travis is known within the company, and by our customers, for solving insanely complex problems over a weekend that would take a normal developer a month. Travis has a strong presence and following in the developer community, and much of his work can be found on Github and YouTube. Travis spends his free time with his wife and kids.</p><p><strong>Randall</strong> - our Lead Architect and sometimes described as “The most interesting developer in the world” due to his extensive worldwide traveling, and his tendency to tell crazy stories. . When not doing home improvement work on his house, or going to his daughters’ ballet classes, he’s resolving conflicting bug fixes and designing our next generation platform. If you have a problem, Randall can solve it, just don't get him started telling a story or you'll never get away.</p><p>And the rest of our extremely talented team including Gary Denise , Angel, Jeriah, Robert, Edwin, Rakesh, Yury and Alena.</p><h5>How you’ll work at Form.io</h5><p>We’re a group of dedicated and talented people - the kind you’d be excited to work with. Here’s what that looks like.</p><p><strong>Live where you want</strong> - We’re mostly located in the Dallas area but we do have very productive members of our team elsewhere. We all work from home a portion of the time, so we’re very good at using tools that enable remote work. Due to market demands and activities, and time zone overlaps we're currently looking specifically for new team members in the US and also in Australia, (but of course we’re also open to attracting exceptional talent from other regions too!)</p><p><strong>No crazy hours</strong> - We’re a startup but we realize that overworking our developers doesn’t make the process faster or better. We’re more interested in you developing great code and solving problems than working crazy hours.</p><p><strong>We’re all adults</strong> - There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor. We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit in front of a computer.</p><p><strong>World class tools</strong> - We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer (probably a mac) and replace it every three years.</p><p><strong>Solve important problems</strong> - We’re constantly doing hard things that are fun and helping companies work. We spend a lot of time designing new systems and solutioning problems for our customers.</p><p><strong>Learn new things</strong> - We’re built on latest generation technology and are always on the lookout for what’s new. Be prepared to constantly be learning promising new technologies and figuring out how they can make our company better.</p><p><strong>Testing is not a dirty word</strong> - We believe in automated testing. Bug fixes as well as new features should come with automated tests to ensure they work and make sure they don’t break in the future.</p><h5>Now, back to you, our new Javascript Developer…</h5><p>You’re a javascript developer with over 5 years of experience. You’ve done work with both the frontend (angular, react, vue, etc) and the backend (nodejs). You understand what makes javascript javascript with concepts like asynchronous functions, promises, scoping and prototypical inheritance. You also stay on top of the latest ES6 features like classes, arrow functions, destructuring and typescript. You know how to write east-to-maintain code, documentation while getting things done under pressure.</p><p>You’ll help us continue building out our platform, client apps and develop new functionality. There are always a ton of new client requests coming in as well as helping them set up their projects and learn how to build with our tools. In addition, there are the new features and functionality. We have a roadmap full of exciting new features such as form workflow, payment gateways, 3rd party platform integrations, and new framework support.</p><p>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer who doesn’t write only so that the computer can understand your code, but also so other developers can understand it too.</li><li>Are a fast learner of new technologies and keep on top of new trends.</li><li>Are a top notch debugger. You can find problems quickly and understand how to fix them without breaking other functionality.</li><li>Are self motivated and take responsibility for fixing problems like:<ul><li>“The form is too slow if you configure it like …”</li><li>&quot;Add paypal integration to this app”</li><li>&quot;We need to allow international versions of the phone field”</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple frameworks with different technologies.</li><li>Have experience with<ul><li>React/Vue/Angular/AngularJS</li><li>Nodejs/Express</li><li>Mongodb</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES2015/Typescript</li></ul></li><li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one app in one of the above frameworks.</li><li>Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li><li><strong>Bonus</strong> - You already use form.io!</li></ul><p><em>Form.io is an equal opportunity employer. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to build and expand a smart, hard-working team that loves working together to build something exciting and relevant.</em></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

Founded in 2011, Traitify has developed a patented methodology by which unique personality profiles are created by users choosing “Me” or “Not Me” when presented with a series of images. Backed by a team of psychologists, we're providing personality based insights to Fortune 100 companies about their customers and employees. Traitify makes personality data accessible to companies looking to better understand their users in order to deliver more personalized recommendations and content.</p><h5>Who You'll Be Working With</h5><p>We're a small team of talented software developers, with a diverse background in various industries and technology stacks. We value individual contributions to team success, and it's through collaboration and these contributions that we create the reliable and performant code that makes Traitify a great place to work. We work remotely and stay in contact primarily through Slack, but also have a daily standup with the whole technology team via Google Hangouts. We understand the value of uninterrupted time, so often we're heads down writing code or researching new technologies or solutions. Speaking of new technologies, we value experimentation to solve new problems, or to improve existing solutions. Here's a few examples:</p><ul><li>Experiment with new languages and platforms to determine direction for future microservices, one of which we're now using in production as a result of this effort.</li><li>Replaced front end of our SAAS product with a React front end</li><li>Rewrote our JS widget library to use Preact framework to reduce code</li></ul><p>We strive to write well-tested and clean code. We perform peer code reviews via Github to help catch defects and learn from one another.</p><p>We also try and get together in person a few times a year, to have face time with each other and the rest of the stellar employees at Traitify.</p><h5>What You'll Be Doing</h5><p>As a Full Stack Engineer, you'll be helping to develop new features in many of our products, primarliy our SAAS product. You'll be helping troubleshoot customer issues, as well as working with teams developing internal tools and products here at Traitify. A typical day can include fixing a defect, writing a new component for our SAAS app, reviewing a pull request or working on an internal tool to help our psychology team. We're growing fast, so a few things in our future include:</p><ul><li>Migrating our existing SAAS app to more of a single page app model.</li><li>Building out new microservices.</li><li>Discovering and building ways to interpret our personality data and turn them into actionable insights for our customers.</li></ul><h5>What We Expect From You</h5><ul><li>Strong experience in writing production quality code in a dynamically-typed scripting language (Ruby, Javascript, Elixir, etc).

    "content": "Join a small JavaScript development team within a successful business about to embark on its next phase of growth.<br /><br />* Working on a varied 3 year roadmap for in-house products, including FLG (sales lead management) and Flow XO (chatbots and messaging).<br />* Our team is focused on JavaScript across the full stack. This role is for a front-end focused developer, with an eye for design and great user experience.<br />* Be part of a small team where the part you play is noticed and rewarded.<br /><br />*Who We Are*<br /><br />We're a B2B (SaaS) technology business established just over 10 years ago. Since then, our growth has been steady and organic, and we've built a great business with several £million in annual revenue and very healthy profits.<br /><br />A few years ago we launched Flow XO, a business messaging and chatbots product. Flow XO is already a leader in its market with users all over the world.<br /><br />*Our Plan For Growth*<br /><br />We're now working on a 3 year plan to accelerate our growth and bring the FLG and Flow XO products closer together.<br /><br />The foundations are there - strong history, good revenues, excellent profits, amazing people in both the team and customers.<br /><br />Our plans include a new focus on sales and marketing, and a revamped approach to product, which will see FLG and Flow XO become an expanded product family and see new products brought into the mix.<br /><br />*The Role*<br /><br />You'll be working on our user interfaces. We use mainly Angular and React, with a little Vue in there as well. Although purely front-end focused, this is a development rather than a designer role. However, design is still important to the job and should be something you feel just as comfortable with.<br /><br />Typical tasks may involve taking a low-res wireframe and turning it into beautifully coded HTML, creating React components for elements of our UI such as drop-down selectors or popup menus, or even working on layout ideas for an entirely new product.<br /><br />Our product roadmap means there is likely to be whole new products being actively worked on every 3-6 months, at least for the next few years.<br /><br />*Is This You?*<br /><br />* An eye for design and layout<br />* You understand what makes a good user interface<br />* Appreciate and can create good quality, efficient, maintainable markup<br />* Have at least mid-level JavaScript skills<br />* Preferably have worked with the frameworks we already use (Angular/React)<br />* You're engaging, approachable and pragmatic<br />* You are great at written communication<br /><br />If this is you, please come and join our team. Our customers need you.<br /><br />*The Rewards*<br /><br />This is a rare opportunity to transform something great into something incredible.<br /><br />A chance to plot the businesses growth and point proudly to when you joined the business, just before the curve takes that sharp upwards turn.<br /><br />As well as a rewarding challenge, we also offer:<br /><br />* A very competitive salary<br />* Flexible working hours<br />* Part-time remote working available<br /><br />Our product team is based in Manchester City Centre. We don't care about your gender, race, sexuality, age, whether you have disabilities we need to accommodate, etc. - we're simply looking for someone that can deliver.<br /><br />*Next Steps*<br /><br />The first step is to send us your current CV and write us an intro. The intro is important, you need to explain (succinctly) how you fit into the picture.<br /><br />We're looking forward to hearing from you!",

We tend to hear about studies and their findings, but we don’t hear how researchers recruit study participants. Let’s resolve this mystery.                            </p>    </div>    <div>        <h6>Table of Contents</h6>        <div></div>    </div></div>        <div>  <div>    <div>      <a rel='nofollow'></a>    </div>      <div>      <h3>Members support Smashing</h3>    </div>  </div>  <p><em>Wonderful</em>, friendly people who keep this lil' site alive — and <strong>get smarter</strong> every&nbsp;day.</p>  <a rel='nofollow'>Are you smashing, too?&nbsp;→</a></div>                   </div>            <div>                <div>    </div>                <p>For UX designers and design teams, research with stakeholders and users is critical. However, accessing research participants isn’t as easy as it sounds. For both professional and amateur researchers finding people to participate in studies can be an elusive task. We often hear about studies and their findings, but we don’t hear as often how researchers recruit study participants.</p><p>Researchers can choose from a variety ways to find participants. Many factors determine the best method to use. This includes resources such as time and money, the research method you’re using, the type or characteristics of participants you want to recruit, and the accessibility of these types of participants. In this post, I’ll remove some of the mystery and provide guidance to those interested in recruiting participants for qualitative UX studies.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1ab7156e-b4b5-44c8-9436-9ea8b0fb9546/finding-research-participants-g-recruiting.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        Potential research participants are everywhere, if you know what to look for.            <h4>Incentives</h4><p>You can use incentives to increase the likelihood of participation in any of these methods of recruitment. Use of incentives is usually a personal choice. Do you feel incentivized participants provide skewed or biased data? I don’t have any issues with providing incentives. An incentive can be a small token of appreciation ($5 gift card) or something more substantial ($200 or more depending on time needed and type of participant.</p><p>I’ve provided guidance for each method based on my experience with incentives.</p>      <div>      <div>        <p>          Is your pattern library up to date today? <em>Alla Kholmatova</em> has just finished a fully fledged book on <strong>Design Systems</strong> and how to get them right.

Particularly at the beginning of a project. This is a great opportunity to understand everyone’s role, what their vision and hopes are for a project or product, and how you might incorporate their experience into the rest of the project. You can increase buy-in and make people feel like part of the process by including stakeholder interviews in any project. I use the term internal stakeholder broadly to describe individuals who have a vested interest in a product or project who are connected to your organization or the product in some way. Many of these internal stakeholders might also be users of the product you are interviewing them about.</p><h5>When To Use It</h5><p>You can always look for opportunities to interview stakeholders and colleagues to learn more. This is especially useful at the beginning of a project. You can learn expectations for a product, background information on what led to the current status of the project, and goals and hopes for the future. Checking in with stakeholders throughout a project will keep them aware of how things are progressing and allow you to get their feedback. I’ve found this is helpful for building trust with stakeholders and making them feel included in the process.</p><h5>How You Might Do It</h5><p>You can often arrange interviews with key stakeholders yourself if they are internal to your company. You’ll identify who is relevant to your project, including project team members, and invite them to an interview. You can contact them to schedule a time, or look to schedule using your company’s shared calendar platform (e.g., Outlook or G Suite). You should know ahead of time how long you need to schedule and how you will interview the participant (in-person or remote) so you can share this information with them at scheduling.</p><p>Identifying and interviewing stakeholders becomes more complicated when you don’t have direct access to scheduling yourself. If your project team is part of a larger organization, you might need to ask colleagues in other departments to help identify and schedule stakeholders. If you are on a project team with outside partners or have external stakeholders, you will often need someone to facilitate identification and scheduling of interviews. I’ll cover some additional challenges for recruiting stakeholders and others through your clients in the identifying participants through a client section.</p><h5>Positive Aspects</h5><p>Gain insight into roles, backgrounds, and history of stakeholders’ involvement with a product or issue, potentially quick to schedule, low to no cost outside of time, can be done remote or in-person, talking to customer/user-facing stakeholders might provide some insight into what users think of a product.</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>Difficult to identify everyone you want to participate, might include people at high-levels who are hard to reach, scheduling if not doing it yourself, scaling down if resources are limited, does not replace research with users, many stakeholders are too close to their product to be objective.</p><h5>Incentives</h5><p>I typically don’t provide an incentive if internal stakeholders are participating during work hours.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I worked on a project with a bank that wanted to design an online onboarding experience for new customers. We needed to understand what the current (non-digital) onboarding experience was. We wanted to document available resources to pull into the onboarding experience. Lastly, we needed to build trust with partners who we were going to rely on to champion the experience we created.</p><p>We relied on word of mouth to learn who we needed to speak with. First, we interviewed the people we were closest to and asked them who else they considered necessary for us to speak with. We spoke with people in numerous US states, both remotely and in-person. We were able to speak with 30 people in three weeks (this was not a project we were dedicating full time). Occasionally, we spoke to people who were not relevant to our specific purpose. There were two key reasons we were given names of some folks who weren’t relevant:</p><ul><li>They were higher up executives with little knowledge of what we were exploring</li><li>The people referring them didn’t understand/effectively convey what we were trying to accomplish, so they volunteered to participate in something not aligned with their role</li></ul><p>We found our most common difficulties were in scheduling and getting people to reply to our initial emails. We were trying to schedule an hour to speak with people who spend most of their days traveling and in meetings. Many of them had personal assistants managing their calendars. Some didn’t have an opening to speak with us for weeks after our initial request. Most people did want to make the time to speak with us. They viewed our project as one with high strategic importance in the long-term health of their company. We also had many people reschedule due to unforeseen conflicts involving client needs arising.</p><p>We were able to paint a clearer picture of the bank’s onboarding experience and what resources were available. We were able to understand what (some) of the leadership viewed as the potential future for an onboarding experience with new customers and what their perceptions of shortcomings were for the current onboarding experience. We were able to identify gaps in knowledge that required additional future research and education. We made connections with critical internal advocates who walked away with a better understanding and appreciation of the experience we were creating. We would not have been able to achieve these outcomes through a survey or through other means of recruiting participants. Later, we were able to approach these same stakeholders to have them provide feedback on the designs for the onboarding experience we created.</p><h4>Identifying Participants Through A Client</h4><p>Many potential research participants are unavailable to the general public. You will find situations where you don’t have direct access to recruiting relevant participants. This is particularly true if you work for a design consultancy/studio, or as part of a shared services team within a large organization. For example, if your client is a widget manufacturer and their product is a widget warehouse product supply application, you will need to access their staff in order to understand their current pain points and needs. You won’t have an easy time finding relevant participants using the population you have access to. You want to conduct research and usability testing with participants who will become the end user of the application, which again means you’d need to access this population through your client.</p>  <div></div><h5>When To Use It</h5><p>In addition to the reasons given in the previous section for recruiting stakeholders, when you have to reach specific populations, need opinions from specific people, and want to make your client-stakeholders feel like part of the process. When you don’t have direct insight or access to critical research participants when you are looking to build relationships beyond the project team you are working with, when you want to include a diverse set of individuals covering relevant areas of the product you’re working on.</p><h5>How To Do It</h5><p>Work closely with your client or person you are collaborating with to identify the right people for the project you are on. Your project will dictate the exact specifications of roles you need. This includes Product Owners, VPs, Business Analysts, and Users. I often provide a script or email language for my clients to use for recruiting participants. I explain the purpose of the research, how you were made aware of the participant (e.g., Jane from accounting gave me your information) how long the conversation is expected to take, potential dates of availability, incentive (if any), prep work required (if any).</p><p>You should provide your client with a screener clearly stating:</p><ul><li>How many of each type of participant you want to participate</li><li>Details you want to know ahead of time (e.g., years using the product, industry)</li><li>Factors leading to disqualification from the study (e.g., less than one year of experience with the product)</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus</strong>: Many organizations keep data on their users. Your client might be able to screen their database and provide you research participants. However, when I’ve used this in the past, there are often many permissions required and processes to gain access to customers. This can add a significant amount of time to your project.</p><p>I am always clear to my clients that scheduling participants is one of the largest hurdles to a project’s timeline. Working with others’ schedules is complicated. You should make it clear to your clients how to recruit, and the need to start recruiting as soon as possible.</p><h5>Positive Aspects</h5><p>You get specific people close to a project or product, you learn about long-term and short-term goals directly from the people you work with, you are able to ask to follow up questions that might inform projects well beyond your current relationship, you learn the history of the product or organization, you can reach relevant people you don’t have direct access to, you gain insight into roles, backgrounds, and history of stakeholders’ and users’ involvement with an issue, you will find talking directly to the users of the product provides context and texture you wouldn’t find from someone without similar knowledge.</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>This can be time-consuming, requires a clear communication of purpose, you might end up talking to people less relevant if your client doesn’t screen effectively, less control over scheduling, lack of control over how information is shared with participants.</p><p>Incentives – I typically don’t provide an incentive if they are from the client and participating during work hours. I’d provide an incentive if they have recruited users who are coming in on an off day or outside of work hours. You might also have a larger incentive but only give it to a couple randomly selected participants.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I worked for a team looking at redesigning a digital report for a large mortgage lender. Many other banks and loan providers do business under the umbrella of this company. We needed to identify a specific type of user, one who: worked for a bank under the parent company and used the report as part of their daily tasks.</p><p>The client wanted us to interview 30 individuals with roles interacting with the report. They identified a handful of these individuals upfront, and then put out a call for participation to identify the remaining individuals. There were numerous layers of communication through relationship managers as well as permissions and disclosures the client needed to handle with each participant.</p><p>We were able to complete over 30 remote (over the phone) interviews in the month we were allotted to collect data. Our client arranged and scheduled each interview. Our most common difficulties were similar to those I gave in the previous case study, scheduling and relevancy of participants.  We were interviewing people who spend their entire workday running the report and using the data to inform their decisions; busy people with limited flexibility of daytime work hours. We made ourselves available at any time a participant had availability in order to solve this. This created drawbacks in scheduling other meetings unrelated to working on the project.</p><p>Some of our participants forwarded the invitation to others they thought should be on the interview as well. We would find this out when more than one person would join the call. We were initially caught off guard when we had a call intended for one person take place with four participants at once. We created a separate multi-participant protocol to account for this occurring on future calls, which it did. I recommend expecting this to happen regardless of who is recruiting your participants. It’s difficult to control what happens, once you send out an invitation to the wild.</p><p>We used data from our interviews to understand the current behaviors, frustrations, and needs of users. We also presented later participants with sample designs in order to get feedback on report layout and feature changes. We delivered a redesigned report that exceeded client expectations and became a reference piece in their quest to get further funding for research and design projects.</p><h4>Paying A Recruitment Firm (When You Have An Accessible Population)</h4><p>Recruitment firms offer services ranging from participant screening and recruitment, facilities to conduct research, recording your sessions, and much more. You can use a recruitment firm when you are conducting research with populations you believe you can reach through contact with the general public. For example, if you are conducting usability testing on an online banking application. You can expect most people familiar with banking transactions (e.g., making a deposit or bill pay) should successfully use your application. Even if they don’t currently use your bank.</p><p>I’ve used a number of firms over the past few years. Most of them offer similar services.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/baef2b30-1589-40e7-a2c0-741f54df2813/finding-research-participants-recruiter.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        Recruitment firms often provide facilities for interviews or usability testing.            <h5>When To Use It</h5><p>When you don’t have direct access to potential participants when you want to have a third party screen your participants, when your sample is available through the general public, when you want to have someone handle recruitment, scheduling, and day-of-research preparation.</p><h5>How To Do It</h5><p>You will need to create the screener the recruiter will use. You decide in advance how many of each type of participant you will want. You’ll want to include a number of “floaters” in your recruitment as well. Floaters are people who meet the requirements of the study and are willing to show up for participation in case some of the other participants don’t show up. Floaters are typically compensated at higher levels because they are committing to spend two or three hours sitting around in case they are needed.</p><p>You’ll also need to provide the screener with enough advance notice as the recruiter requires. I’ve found this is two weeks in advance for most studies, and three weeks in advance for more complex studies. All recruitment firms offer participants an incentive, usually cash, to participate in a study. You will have to be ok with the fact your participants are receiving money to participate. I haven’t found this to be problematic, but you should be prepared to defend why you don’t think this will add any additional bias to your data.</p><h5>Positive Aspects</h5><p>Very detailed screening, don’t have to find people, often have a facility you can use, will record audio and video as needed, will recruit additional participants in case some don’t show up.</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>Cost, the time needed in advance if you have a difficult to reach population, participants trying to game the system.</p><p>Incentives – Recruitment firms almost always compensate the people they recruit. You will pay the recruitment firm a set fee they pay to participants.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I worked for a team wanting to define the digital needs and behaviors of specific types of Financial Advisors. The client did not want to expose their brand during any of the research, so they did not want to facilitate the recruitment. The client wanted the interviews to pull participants from more than one major city in the US. We worked with a recruitment firm to identify and recruit participants, as well as to conduct the interview sessions.</p><p>We worked with the client to create a detailed screener with items meant to refine the population to the specific participants we wanted for the study. The recruitment firm asked for three weeks to find 15 participants for the first city in our study. The usual turn around when working with the firm was two weeks with less specialized participants. We were also advised to provide a higher incentive, over double what we typically offered, due to the probability we were asking participants to step away from work and the perceived value of their time.</p><p>We were able to interview 15 participants over the course of two days. We found a few of the participants didn’t actually meet the qualifications we’d screened for. They had manipulated their responses to qualify. Our client was unhappy with this. We were able to use the floaters to replace the participants who didn’t truly qualify. We were also able to get a refund on what we’d paid to recruit the unqualified participants.</p><p>Ultimately, we reached our goal of interviewing the right number of participants in the right amount of time, and produced a report on needs and behaviors for our client.</p><p>We would not have been able to access this population without the use of the recruitment firm. The client was unwilling to expose their brand and therefore unwilling to identify participants from their contact list. We would have spent more time and money than the project allowed if we were left to recruit participants. We don’t have contact lists or the ability to easily identify specialized populations through our own resources. We still experienced frustration with the lack of initial quality participants the recruitment firm provided. In general, we’ve had positive experiences with recruitment firms, but the more specialized the population, the more likely you will find some duds.</p><h4>Guerilla Recruiting (When You Want To Find People In The Wild)</h4><p>You can utilize public spaces to recruit potential study participants. Guerilla research is a term for quick and dirty research conducted with people as they go about their daily tasks (in the wild so to speak). The term is meant to reflect a context in which you are pressed for resources. However, you can benefit from using this method of recruiting even when you have resources for other methods. Sometimes collecting data from people when they are in specific settings is the most appropriate method.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3c7fc127-bdbd-4139-9fa6-20375696f603/finding-research-participants-clipboard.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        You can find plenty of potential users in the wild.            <p>You should determine a space you want to recruit participants for a logical reason. Let’s say you’re designing a smartphone application meant to help people track their workouts at the gym. You would want to recruit participants from that setting, entering or exiting the gym. If you wanted to test out a new form of electronic payment, you’d want to be present in a setting where transactions take place.</p><h5>When To Use It</h5><p>When you have little time or budget, when you have access to relevant populations, when you only want to get quick feedback from a few people, when you can spend 20 minutes or less per participant, when you have a product related to a specific physical space (e.g., an art museum tour application).</p><h5>How To Do It</h5><p>Find a location, get permission if needed, create a script. I’ve previously written a <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/the-art-of-the-intercept/' rel='nofollow'>detailed article</a> on the specifics of recruiting participants in public.</p><h5>Positive Aspects</h5><p>Quick execution, the potential for multiple locations if you have the resources, small or large sample sizes, accessing relevant populations, compatible with multiple research methods.</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>Little ability for screening, approaching people takes practice and skill, potentially inclement weather if outside, a lot of standing around.</p><h5>Incentives</h5><p>I’d base the incentive on the amount of time and type of activity. For example, I might give a product discount code for something taking a minute or less. A $5 gift card if you are taking a few minutes of their time.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I worked on a project examining the use of technology in library settings. Specifically, we wanted to understand the usability of a system for finding and locating materials within the library. We wanted to work with people who use a library. We needed to test inside of the library because the last part of testing involved physically locating the material.</p><p>We sent two researchers to spend multiple days at the library while it was open for patrons. We stood with clipboards at the entrance of the library. We asked patrons if they would spend a few minutes with us participating in our study. We then observed them using the system to search for an item and asked them to locate the material based on where the system told them it should be located.</p><p>Our biggest challenge was long periods of time where there were no new patrons coming into the library. We wanted to complete 30 to 40 sessions using three different scenarios. We had budgeted to spend one week onsite to get this many responses. We had to extend our timeline for the following week to reach our goal.</p><p>We were able to suggest improvements in the interface, terminology, and an explanation of where materials were located. We would not have had similar findings if we hadn’t been on location at a library and we might not have had as valuable insights if we used people who were not library patrons.</p><h4>Friends And Family (Low On Time And Budget)</h4><p>Sometimes, you might have very little opportunity to engage in research. There are many reasons for this, time, budget, or your working for a client who refuses to allow research as part of the project plan. The designers I’ve worked with still want to have some type of feedback to shape their thinking. You can still look to gather some meaningful data from those you have closest access to. Perhaps you are on a project where you are working on a product that is relevant to your coworkers or friends you have easy access to. You might ask a few of them to participate in interviews about the product.</p><p>Friends and family are the definition of a convenience sample, and should only be used when no other options exist. This is the most biased and least rigorous way of collecting data. However, you can still benefit from insights into experiences you might otherwise not get. You can use friends and family to participate in interviews or usability testing as a means of accessing informing your design. I strongly recommend conducting additional research, using one of the other methods of finding participants, as your design progresses.</p><h5>When To Use It</h5><p>As a last resort, when you have no budget, little time, yet you want to know something about the context or users you are designing for when you have access to relevant people to participate in the study. Background information of your participants.</p><h5>How To Do It</h5><p>Reach out to others you and your team know; you can include social media to distribute the call to participate, schedule a time to speak or send an email explaining what you’re asking participants to do (you can also distribute survey links this way)Positive – you will get some feedback, almost instant, low budget</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>Most limited pool of participants, possibly less reach, you’re are relying on favors, less ability to screen for specific characteristics, introducing a larger bias due to familiarity with participants.</p><h5>Incentives</h5><p>I would incentivize based on time and budget. A $25 gift card is much less expensive than what you’d pay for a participant from a recruitment firm, but friends and family might find this amount acceptable for up to an hour of time.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I was part of a project team responding to a (paid) request for proposals (RFP) from a major vacation industry company. We had two weeks to turn around our response, including design concepts to show our thinking. Most of our team had no experience in using the services from this specific industry. We needed to find out more information to help inform our response. We didn’t have the resources to undertake our typical research process of finding and interviewing stakeholders or representative end users. Instead, we reached out to friends and family members who stated they’d had experience in this vacation activity within the past three years.</p><p>We emailed our staff and asked if anyone had friends or family members with this qualification who’d be willing to engage in brief phone conversations about their experience. We conducted interviews with seven people over the course of the next two days. Our designers were able to use the insights we gained to better understand the types of needs users might have while vacationing. Our concepts attempted to address some of the issues our participants stated existed when they had experienced while vacationing.</p><p>Although we didn’t win the long-term work, our team was able to place among the top candidates. We credited the participation of friends and family in our research as part of what helped our design stand out in a positive way. We were later awarded separate work from the team we presented to for the initial RFP.</p><p>The table below provides a summary of key characteristics for each participant recruitment method I’ve covered in this article.</p><p></p><table>    <thead>        <tr>            <th></th>            <th>Time</th>            <th>Cost</th>            <th>Ability to pre-screen participants</th>            <th>Ability to access participants</th>        </tr>    </thead>    <tbody>        <tr>            <td>Stakeholder</td>            <td>Slow</td>            <td>Low</td>            <td>Easy</td>            <td>Easy</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>Client Recruits</td>            <td>Slow</td>            <td>Low</td>            <td>Difficult</td>            <td>Difficult</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>Recruitment Firm</td>            <td>Slow</td>            <td>High</td>            <td>Easy</td>            <td>Varies – harder to reach specific populations</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>Guerilla Recruiting</td>            <td>Fast</td>            <td>Free</td>            <td>Difficult</td>            <td>Easy</td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td>Friends &amp; Family</td>            <td>Fast</td>            <td>Free</td>            <td>Moderate</td>            <td>Easy depending on topic</td>        </tr>    </tbody></table><em>Table 1: Characteristics of common research participant recruitment methods</em><p></p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>We need to access users and potential users in order to effectively conduct research. I’ve covered a number of common ways you can find research participants. Each has certain strengths and weaknesses. You’ll want to become familiar with each of these and adapt your approach based on your product, budget, and timeline.</p><div>    <span>(cc, ra, il)</span></div></div>            </div>        </div>                 <div>            <div>                                                </div>        </div>                    <div></div>                </div>     <div>        <div>            <div>    <h5>Browse All Smashing Magazine Topics</h5>    <ul>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Accessibility</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Android</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Animation</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Apps</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>CSS</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Design</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Design Patterns</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Design Systems</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>E-Commerce</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Freebies</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Graphics</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>HTML</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Illustrator</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Inspiration</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>iOS</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>JavaScript</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Mobile</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Pattern Libraries</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Performance</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Photoshop</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Plugins</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>React</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Responsive Web Design</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Service Workers</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Sketch</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Typography</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>UI</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Usability</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>User Experience</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Wallpapers</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Web Design</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>WordPress</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Workflow</a>        </li>          </ul></div>        </div>        <div>            <div>                <p>With a commitment to quality content for the design community.</p>                <p>Founded by Vitaly Friedman and Sven Lennartz. <span>2006–2018</span>.</p>                <p>Smashing is proudly running on <a href='https://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=link&amp;utm_medium=parter&amp;utm_campaign=sm-footer' rel='nofollow'>Netlify</a>.</p>                <p>Fonts by <a href='http://latinotype.com/' rel='nofollow'>Latinotype</a>.</p>            </div>            <ul>                <li>✎ <a rel='nofollow'>Write for us</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>Contact us</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>About us (Impressum)</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>Privacy policy</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>Membership login</a></li>                <li><a href='mailto:markus.seyfferth@smashingmagazine.com?subject=Let’s talk about advertising' rel='nofollow'>Advertise</a></li>            </ul>        </div>    </div>    <div>    <a title=&quot;Back to top&quot; rel='nofollow'>                    Back to top                                    </a></div>    <div></div>  <div></div>                ",

Before writing any code, the engineer tagged to the product writes a blog post announcing it to the StackShare community. From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we're building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.</p><p>Interview process:</p><p>Phone Screen -&gt; Technical Homework -&gt; Technical Interviews -&gt; Product Interviews -&gt; Offer!</p><p>Check out our careers page: <a href='https://stackshare.io/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://stackshare.io/careers</a> Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you're emailing us please include your resume and/or LinkedIn profile<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects while concurrently laying the foundation for a stand-alone product which will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We have an excellent four person team in place with Big-4 backend experience. We're looking to get one final person in place to help us define what a modern and maintainable front-end stack should look like and to help build our product. Hopefully that's you.</p><p>Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we aren't as familiar with. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the TODAY Show, The View, and Good Morning America many times. We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 40 employees and $25M annual revenue over the past five years.</p><p>As a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. We believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we’re a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy -- it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.</p><p>We are seeking an ambitious and nice lead engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team’s growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you.</p><p>Learn more about this position and apply at <a href='https://grnh.se/qrifafaj2' rel='nofollow'>https://grnh.se/qrifafaj2</a></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United States</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>USA</p></dd>        </dl>",

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere!)</strong> </p><p><span>Who are we?</span></p><p><span>BuySellAds operates the largest self-serve advertising marketplace on the web. We’re an adtech company empowering publishers and advertisers to connect more efficiently. We're growing fast, and we want you to be part of our team!</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Don’t let the “adtech” part scare you away: our mission is to help publishers better monetize their sites so they can spend their time focusing on what they care about (their content!) rather than selling ads. We leverage tech to help broker these sales, and attempt to distance ourselves from the shady world of advertising that existed before.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>StackOverflow, CodingHorror.com, NPR, and The Atlantic are just some of the sites who we’re able to help make more money - connecting them with advertisers like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Braintree, and Atlassian who are all able to expand their reach through us.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 35+ people spread out across 30 cities in 6 countries. We primarily use Rails and React, as well as PHP and Go, but seek to hire developers who are language agnostic and are more interested in shipping quality code than bikeshedding it.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Who are you?</span></p><p><span>We’re looking for developers at any level (junior, intermediate, senior) to help us build out our platform. Everyone on our dev team makes meaningful contributions that positively impact our team and our customers every day - you will ship code on your very first day at BSA.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Ideally, we’re looking for someone who is:</span></p><ul><li><span>Comfortable across the full stack of the development cycle: frontend, backend, database stuff, as well as following through with testing and shipping.</span></li><li><span>A self-starter: remote teams carry lots of autonomy. There’s no micromanaging here.</span></li><li><span>A great communicator: we’re big on teaching, learning, debating, and explaining, and these things require clear, deliberate communication.</span></li><li><span>Wary of bullet lists with more than 3 items in job postings: we aren’t heavily process-oriented or believe in tons of structure, and if your eyes have glazed over while reading this list, you might just fit right in.</span></li></ul><p><span>You’re likely more awesome than you think, so apply even if you only check a few of these boxes. Please note that r</span><span>ight now we're only hiring within 3 hours of Eastern Time.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Interested?</span></p><p><span>Woohoo! To apply, send us a blurb about who you are and what you’re into through Authentic Jobs. If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on what you like to build, things you’ve built in the past that you’re proud of, and what you’d like to be building now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straightforward: we do an initial meet-and-greet phone screen, a live pair-coding session over Slack (our primary mode of communication), and a short take-home coding test. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>And if we are the right fit? We’re stoked. Come build a platform to help fix advertising with us.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> Fully remote; small team/high impact; strong, motivated team. Big on mentorship and personal growth.</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</span></p><p><span>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</span></p><p><span>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</span></p><ul><li><span>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</span></li><li><span>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</span></li><li><span>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</span></li><li><span>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</span></li><li><span>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</span></li><li><span>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</span></li><li><span>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</span></li></ul><p><span>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</span></p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p><span>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</span></p><p><span>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</span></p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Analytics Fire            </h2>            <div><p><span>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</span></p><p><span>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”</span></p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible Schedule                            </div>                    ",

We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack developer that can build features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile), challenge our thinking on architecture and lead a high-performing team.</p><p><strong>About you </strong></p><p>We’re excited to tell you about Aula and what we’re working on, but first of all, let us explain who we’re looking for. The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>You have experience leading a team of developers (remote is ideal!)</li><li>You have both front-end <em>and</em> back-end experience</li><li>You have experience with React - unless you have significant Javascript experience with other libraries so that you’ll be able to pick it up quickly</li><li>You have experience creating and iterating on products from end-to-end: we think there are certain things that freelance and agency work doesn’t teach you such as working end-to-end (full feature) on an entire system.</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>About us </strong></p><p>Aula is a conversational platform for education. Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.</p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and <a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement.</p><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a> with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d <a href='https://cl.ly/2i0V3z453H2K' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>this blog post</a>, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack developer that can build features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile) and challenge our thinking on architecture. Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Pushing our thinking on core architecture choices</li><li>Be part of leading a high-performing team: inspiring team members, set priorities and own results</li><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Interview process <br></strong>Interview processes&nbsp;don’t need to be scary and stressful for us to be able to pick out those of you that would fit in the best at Aula. The first three stages all take place asynchronously in a dedicated Slack channel filled with other curious and smart candidates - it’s turned out to be <a href='https://cl.ly/1P1P2i0k1320' rel='nofollow'>quite a community</a>. You’ll chat with Oliver about your experience and your thoughts particular topics. You’ll then receive a (~5 hour) test to complete over the course of 48 hours - on the weekend if you’d like. Then you get to meet the team on video conference. If both parties feel comfortable, we’ll then give you an offer to join us. The whole process takes place over the course of around 10 days, in your own time.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role. Please start your application with the words ‘I breathe semicolons’ to show that you took your time to read all of this </p><p>Look forward to hearing from you,</p><p>The Aula team </p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Aula            </h2>            <div><p>Aula is a conversational platform for education.

Vivoom \nwants infrastructure developers with cloud and/or video experience.\n\n\n ENVIRONMENT\n\n You'll wear lots of hats. As a startup, we believe all developers should \nunderstand operations and all &quot;ops&quot; should be software engineers. As a company, \nwe want everyone to shape our product.\n\n Vivoom is looking for experienced engineers near its Flemington, NJ and/or \nBoston, MA offices. We live with video conferencing and Slack.

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Toronto, ON or Anywhere)</strong> </p><p>Do you get excited about scaling, securing, and maintaining systems, so that our clients and our team have the tools they need, when they need them? Does troubleshooting, tinkering, and designing solutions to improve and monitor performance get you out of bed in the morning? Do you love to develop new features and build new products for a growing organization that makes a difference in people’s lives? Precision Nutrition is looking for an experienced developer who doesn’t just have a passion for building killer features, but also cares about maintaining and improving the overall health of our platform and infrastructure.</p><h2>Who You Are</h2><p>You balance the demands of product development, with the need to scale our growing user base. You can work anywhere in the stack: you mess with javascript for breakfast, write a new RESTful API endpoint in Rails for a mid-morning snack, tune a query in Postgres for lunch, and write an Ansible cookbook for dinner. You share our belief that every developer takes ownership of our production environment and isn’t above operations work.</p><p>We know this is a tall order and requires a special person to do it right. If this sounds intriguing to you, read on.</p><h2>What You Get to Do</h2><p><strong>Ruby/Rails API development.</strong> Our coaching platform is backed by a RESTful API implemented in Rails. You’ll spend a lot of your time building, testing, and working with Rails. We’re using Elixir and Phoenix too, so come prepared to learn!</p><p><strong>Ember.</strong> Our front-end devs are focused on working with our suite of Ember, user-facing applications - but it really helps if you can see the big picture and understand our stack front to back. That means learning Ember.js and Ember Data. Don’t worry - you’ll have lots of help. We’ve got a team of Ember experts to show you the ropes.</p><p><strong>DevOps.</strong> You’ll write reliable, scripted means of deploying code and system changes (today we use Ansible, yet we’re open to trying new tools). You’ll maintain provisioning and continuous integration systems, keep system software up to date, and ensure code can be deployed and rolled back easily and reliably, while making sure backups are behaving, and security best practices are being followed.</p><p><strong>Monitor performance.</strong>You’ll design and execute performance tests on our website and other applications, as well as recommend and implement system and application performance best practices.</p><p><strong>Maintain our systems.</strong> You’ll monitor the health of all systems, participate in our on-call rotation team, and respond to, and escalate infrastructure issues. You’ll perform regular and ad hoc sysadmin tasks on all shared systems, and manage Amazon Web Services and other hosting service providers. You’ll schedule and manage site downtime, and work with the team to proactively add infrastructure so that our clients and team have the best experience possible.</p><h2>Our Ideal Candidate</h2><p><strong>Is experienced.</strong> You have at least 5 years of experience in a Development or DevOps role in an Agile environment. You know, or are excited to learn, Ruby on Rails, Ember, and maybe even some Elixir/Phoenix, as well as the usual tools of the trade: Amazon Web Services such as EC2, S3 and RDS, Ansible, Vagrant, Linux, PostgreSQL, Continuous Integration, and Redis.</p><p><strong>Is on the cutting edge.</strong> In your spare time, you research and stay up to date on the latest and greatest best practices, systems, and tools.</p><p><strong>Likes variety.</strong> You'll be wrangling all kinds of systems, apps, and technologies - everything from our Wordpress-based sales sites to our modern Ember/Rails based coaching platform and our next generation Elixir based payment processing system.</p><p><strong>Can easily switch gears.</strong> You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a changing environment - you understand that things change as new information is made available. You don’t mind managing multiple projects and have the ability to have a few balls up in the air at one time.</p><p><strong>Cares.</strong> You take care of our data and systems like they are your very own.</p><p><strong>Is self-motivated and can work independently.</strong> Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction. You are highly organized and always eager to learn more and share with the team.</p><p><strong>Leaves their ego at the door.</strong> You have integrity, talent, are outgoing, have a palpable excitement about the future, and don’t show it off. Shadiness, mediocrity, cynicism, and excessive &quot;constructive criticism&quot; are out.</p><p><strong>Is resilient and has a growth mindset.</strong> Part of open, honest communication is having the ability to deliver honest, direct feedback without being offensive or critical. The other part is having the ability to view honest, direct feedback as a gift you can use to get better. If you’re married to your ideas or are (even mildly) offended when they’re challenged, this probably won’t be a good fit for you.</p><p><strong>Has worked remotely.</strong> You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges.</p><p><strong>Wants to be part of a purpose-driven organization.</strong>&nbsp;PN is a pretty incredible place and is committed to allowing you to do the work you love and love the work you do.</p><p>Life-changing, research-driven nutrition coaching. That's our mission at Precision Nutrition.</p><p>As an organization, we:</p><ul><li>Seek and support diversity.</li><li>Offer 4 weeks paid time-off, benefits, and the ability to work remotely.</li><li>Set you up with whatever fancy gear you need to perform at your best.</li><li>Give you the flexibility to make your own schedule.</li></ul><p>Not only that, but if you join us you can:</p><p><strong>Work in the fitness and nutrition industry. </strong> We love exercise, we love nutrition, and we love sport. That’s why we started this company. If you do too, you’ll appreciate how rare it is to find a career you really love. For active, fit people, Precision Nutrition is that opportunity.</p><p><strong>Work with fun, bright, and talented people.</strong> We’re a small company, and we’re picky about who we work with, because to us, this isn’t just a job; it’s our life.</p><p>If you or someone you know is interested please apply below.<strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.</p><p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p><p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p><p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p><p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p><p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p><p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>React &amp; React Native</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Swift &amp; Objective C</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Ethereum / Solidity</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Ruby on Rails</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Python</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Pandas</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>Serverless</p><ul><li></li></ul><p>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</p><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p><p><strong>This Role: Senior Software Engineer // Javascript</strong></p><p>Over the past few years, we’ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well.</p><p>We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.</p><p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p><p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a <a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>holacracy</a>. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to <a href='http://www.extremeprogramming.org/' rel='nofollow'>Extreme Programming</a> as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p><p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC—prices and plans vary based on your region—as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life &amp; AD&amp;D. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company’s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div><div></div></div></div></div>",

We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p><p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p><ul><li><p>React &amp; React Native</p></li><li><p>Swift &amp; Objective C</p></li><li><p>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</p></li><li><p>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</p></li><li><p>Ethereum / Solidity</p></li><li><p>Ruby on Rails</p></li><li><p>Python</p></li><li><p>Pandas</p></li><li><p>Serverless</p></li><li><p>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</p></li></ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p><p><strong>This Role: Senior Software Engineer // Javascript</strong></p><p>Over the past few years, we’ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well.</p><p>We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.</p><p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p><p>We are believers in transparency and openness.

What does it mean?</p><p>Everyone at Cycloid meets once every quarter at our headquarter in France to define collectively the strategy/road map/features for the coming quarter.

If you don't have any ideas, it will be a challenge because we don't have a product manager and we are trying to work without it due to our culture. We want to empower people.</p><p>You are, of course, a team player and know how to work in remote even if you can work at Cycloid office in Paris if you are in Paris.

We connect applications, wherever they are hosted, to independent cloud services made by developers who care.</p><p>We are looking for an experienced, collaborative front-end engineer to inspire us, teach us, and bring our React architecture and coding forward.</p><p>Our partially distributed engineering team is fun-loving, knowledgeable, and extremely productive. We’re organized to let you explore and grow a variety of skills and capabilities, with many opportunities to make a significant impact. Many of us have strong ties to the open-source world, and have experience building tools at companies like Heroku, Red Hat, and Canonical.</p><p>We value diversity and supporting a distributed culture. Gender diversity is currently about one quarter. About half of the company work outside of the home Halifax, Canada office, including the product and engineering leaders.</p><h6>What you'll do</h6><h5>Responsibilities</h5><ul><li>Help lead a friendly, supportive engineering culture that encourages you and the entire company to improve as engineers, teams, and people.</li><li>Be a model and mentor for building well-architected, performant, well-tested, and understandable code.</li><li>Prevent and manage technical debt.

Each new cloud service we use today introduces complexity in the form of another bill, account to manage, credential to secure, and code to deploy.</p><p>Manifold allows you to build and offer cloud services to developers without having to worry about billing, identity, and credential distribution (An example of one such service: <a href='https://www.jawsdb.com/' rel='nofollow'>JawsDB</a>).</p><p>We're a small, remote-friendly venture-backed company based in Halifax, Canada with teams in Toronto and San Francisco. With a shared passion for making developers lives easier and our backgrounds reflect that, having worked at the likes of Red Hat, Heroku, and Salesforce.</p><h6>Are you interested?</h6><h5>Work With Us</h5><p>We believe in having people work from where they are most productive.

On any given project, you will be using React/Redux or Backbone/Marionette to create delightful experiences that communicate with internal APIs, integrate with 3rd party services and are tested with Jest or Jasmine.</li><li>Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to&nbsp;<a href='http://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fworkable.com%2Fnr%3Fl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fworkable.com%252Fnr%253Fl%253Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252Fwww.helpscout.net%25252Fblog%25252Fagile-remote-teams%25252F' rel='nofollow'>remote, agile development</a>. When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with tests and tag your team for review using video and screen-sharing as needed. We have invested heavily in local Docker development and cloud-based continuous integration and delivery so you can get setup fast and your development branch can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>You’ll work with five other full-time JavaScript / front-end engineers to maintain and improve JS / CSS standards and best practices across all of Help Scout. You’ll work with a design team with strong technical capabilities who are focused on creating scalable design systems and developing reusable interactive components across our projects. You will have the opportunity to contribute to these frameworks and other open source projects.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li><li>Since the Help Scout web app depends on PHP passthroughs between the APIs and front-end, you will have opportunities to write some PHP. Experience with PHP and/or other object-oriented languages will be necessary for you to do excellent work across our stack.</li><li>Everything is secondary to the&nbsp;<i>customer experience</i>. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability.</li><li>You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.</li><li>You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM - 6PM ET).</li></ul><div><h4>About you</h4></div><ul><li>You are experienced with modern JS development practices and frameworks including ES6 and React / Redux. You’ve worked on JS projects at scale and feel confident solving complex problems.</li><li>You are comfortable extending a large Backbone apps and have a solid understanding of the best practices. Marionette experience is a bonus but not required. You won't have trouble picking it up.</li><li>You are experienced with JS/CSS code quality tools, preprocessors and build tools.</li><li>Your code and interactions are not only reliable and smooth across current browsers, but they can also be read, maintained and understood easily by other engineers on your team.</li><li>You are an excellent communicator who can write and speak with empathy for our customers and team. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You believe in writing thorough unit and integration tests and have at least tried TDD. You like owning the quality of the code you write — QA doesn’t mean throwing it over the wall for someone else to test.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You are helpful and empathetic and care about building on our company culture that embraces these qualities.</li></ul><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>&nbsp;- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well.

We are pushing the envelope for what our industry has seen in regard to customer experience and service. This position is for someone more skilled in Javascript (Node/Angular/React/Meteor) than .Net languages.

You know your craft and you may have even squealed a little inside when the word &quot;craft&quot; was used to describe software development.

Your work will empower over 8,000 businesses around the world to provide great customer service, and will support other senior engineers on your team.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Tools we use</h4></div><ul><li>PHP 7.x</li><li>Lumen, Laravel, and Symfony</li><li>Backbone.js, Marionette.js, and React.js</li><li>Node.js</li><li>RabbitMQ</li><li>Redis</li><li>Pusher</li><li>Java(APIs)</li><li>MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB</li></ul><div><h4>About the role</h4></div><ul><li>The engineering team currently has thirty-four talented engineers. &nbsp;You will be working on one of the Help Scout web app teams, which currently has 6 engineers (PHP, JavaScript). On a typical day you may help a customer with an issue, work on a new feature, create a third party integration or enhance back-end tools to support our growth team. On any given project, you will be communicating with internal APIs, integrating with 3rd party services, optimizing processes using Redis, RabbitMQ, various AWS services, and wrapping it all up in support of a Backbone/Marionette or React front end.</li><li>Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/agile-remote-teams/' rel='nofollow'>remote, agile development</a>. When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with test cases and tag your team for review (often over a video and screen-sharing session).&nbsp;</li><li>We have invested heavily in local Docker development and cloud-based continuous integration and delivery so you can get setup fast and your development branch can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our top-notch in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li></ul><div><h4>About you</h4></div><ul><li>You are very experienced with modern PHP development practices and open source frameworks. You’ve worked on these sorts of projects at scale and feel confident solving complex problems. You view “best practices” as a starting point for critical thinking, rather than a dogma to follow.&nbsp;</li><li>You have created a single page application using Backbone (or a similar framework) and can write JavaScript from scratch to implement a feature. Marionette and/or React experience is a bonus, but not required. We can help you pick it up.</li><li>Your code is not only reliable and performant for customers, but can be read, maintained and understood easily by other engineers on your team. The&nbsp;<a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/' rel='nofollow'>Zen of Python</a>&nbsp;resonates with you for any language.</li><li>You believe in writing unit and integration tests and have at least tried TDD. You like owning the quality of the code you write— QA doesn’t mean throwing it over the wall for someone else to test. You understand that some things are too costly to automate and must be manually tested to get it right.&nbsp;</li><li>You take pride in your work and ownership of the solutions you build. When a team member or customer is in need, you feel a sense of urgency to understand their pain and thoughtfully help.</li><li>You are curious and constantly learning. Believing that “a rising tide lifts all ships,” you make everyone around you better sharing what you have learned and looking for ways to improve both yourself and the team. &nbsp;</li><li>You are a humble professional who wants to be challenged by the work and not the workload. You are willing to ask for help when necessary and unafraid to say “I don’t know.” At the same time, you have the confidence to take on complex and challenging problems.</li><li>You are proactive about solving problems and improving things. You take the initiative to build tools and processes that will help everyone. When working in the codebase, you leave things better than you found them.</li><li>You are an excellent communicator who can write and speak with empathy for our customers and team. You can easily communicate complex ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM- 6PM ET).</li></ul><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well. The formula we use to calculate all salaries is public to employees and is improved upon regularly.</li><li><span>Work anywhere</span>- We’ll fly you to Boston for a week of new employee on-boarding and buy your home office furniture or help you pay for a co-working space. You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM- 6PM ET).</li><li><span>Health and dental insurance</span>- We cover you and your family's health/dental insurance 100%.

Our&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/' rel='nofollow'>software</a>&nbsp;is used and trusted by businesses of every shape and size.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Designed to go the distance</span></div><div><br></div><div>Our mission is to foster the world’s customer-centric businesses by providing tools that serve customers in the most human, helpful way.

We overcome remote challenges through transparency, trust, and video conferencing. The reward is worth the effort—we’ll take talent, skill, and diverse perspectives over local geography any day.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all, we want Help Scout to be a place where passionate people can do their very best work. You won’t find any ping-pong tables or kegerators here. Instead, you’ll be surrounded by driven, supportive teammates who will push you to be better.

Vivoom adds super-high-end branded video effects \nand assets. Consumers share broadly. Their friends and followers watch it, like \nit, and are a look-alike audience. Brands republish. It's user-generated \nadvertising that works incredibly well and everyone feels good about it. Vivoom \nwants infrastructure developers with cloud and/or video experience.\n\n\n ENVIRONMENT\n\n You'll wear lots of hats. As a startup, we believe all developers should \nunderstand operations and all &quot;ops&quot; should be software engineers. As a company, \nwe want everyone to shape our product.\n\n Vivoom is looking for experienced engineers near its Flemington, NJ and/or \nBoston, MA offices. We live with video conferencing and Slack. Telecommuting is \navailable for candidates, but we believe it's good to mix it up in person too. \nYou will report directly to Vivoom's co-founder and CTO.\n\n\n PROJECTS (CHOOSE 2)\n\n * Infrastructure Development for Video Effects and Assembly\n * Cloud-based DevOps Automation\n * Self-Serve Client Platform Development\n\n\n THINGS YOU'LL USE\n\n * Languages (Python, Java, shells)\n * Platforms (Linux, Apache, nginx, MySQL, MongoDB, EC2, S3, Docker)\n * Workflow (Git, JIRA, SCRUM)\n\n\n BONUS SKILLS\n\n * Old School (threads, forks, named pipes, daemons, message queues, etc.)\n * Dev Ops (AWS autoscale, AMIs, ELBs, DNS, CDNs, VPCs, NFS, monitoring, \nalarms)\n * Lighter Side (JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, REST, Social APIs, SQL, CMSs)\n * Heavier Side (ffmpeg, neural networks, video concepts, audio concepts)\n * Troubleshooting\n\n\n ABOUT VIVOOM\n\n Vivoom is a cutting-edge, fast growing technology company that is disrupting \nthe way brands reach consumers. From the perspective of today's consumer, if \nyour product doesn't seamlessly enable consumer sharing, it's broken. Products \nthat enable sharing are gaining market share and emerging as market leaders.\n\n Vivoom powers the always-on consumer sharing capabilities that let clients \nfurther improve the product experience for the consumer and further monetize \ntheir brand IP. Vivoom's white-labeled consumer sharing experience can be \ndropped into brand's digital or physical products and channels to provide \nseamless sharing right from the brand's products with fun branded filters for \ntheir consumers to share across any and all social and messaging platforms.\n\n Vivoom's platform provides the brand-safety and control, the republishing and \nthe analytics capabilities needed to ensure consumer created content is safe, \non-brand and delivering engagement results that dramatically outperform paid \ninterruptive ads.\n\n Vivoom is driven by highly proprietary IP and is led by executives with \nproven track records as pioneers in media, advertising, and technology.\n\n Vivoom is powering the in-product sharing capabilities for world-class \ncompanies including Microsoft, Capital One, Johnson & Johnson, Boston Celtics, \nUnivision and more.\n\n\n HOW TO APPLY\n\n Click reply and include your resume and something about yourself. \n * Principals only.

Our software allows healthcare providers and patients to make better decisions faster.

We also have other large public and private exchange networks, as well as health plan exchanges in active deployment.</p><p>Our team is quite small, but all of us are technical people. We maintain a strong start-up/hacker culture. CareEvolution has partnered with a few large companies with relationships in all 50 states - and beyond - to supply a large portion of our sales and marketing efforts. &nbsp;Our stack is recognized by leading HIE industry analysts as the most technologically sophisticated HIE on the market - by a significant margin. &nbsp;Mention the word sesquipedalian in your employment application to have it processed quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>We are focused and execute very quickly. But we also have a lot of fun - biweekly visits to the bar, daily ping pong/foosball/darts games in the office, hackathons every eight weeks for pet projects, biannual company-wide get-togethers, board game nights, rock climbing nights, disc golf days... etc. We are also a very family-friendly organization.

We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything in this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!</p><p>As a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry. You will help us shape the digital guest experience for restaurant brands served by Olo. You will contribute to technology selection, architecture and user experience for our front-end applications.</p><p>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience building user interfaces that put users first and look and feel awesome to use</li><li>Deep knowledge of ES6/ES2015+ and one or more modern Javascript frameworks, with a preference for React or Ember</li><li>Demonstrable understanding of the full .NET web stack</li><li>Leadership experience that spans one or more aspects of technology selection, architecture and design oversight, and mentoring others</li><li>Superb problem solving skills with an emphasis on pragmatism, quality, and performance</li><li>Passion for learning new skills and technologies</li><li>Excellent collaboration skills</li><li>BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience</li><li>Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Olo            </h2>            <div><p>Olo reaches millions of consumers by powering mobile and online ordering for many of the country’s largest restaurant chains. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.</p><p>We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller. &nbsp;We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.</p><p><strong>Who We Need</strong></p><p>Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun. &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group. &nbsp;</li><li>Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Types of Roles</strong></p><p>We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. &nbsp;Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general &quot;gist&quot; of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast &quot;good enough&quot; approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in &quot;science experiment land&quot;</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>US Person based anywhere in the US (100% remote allowed but no off shore)</li><li>5 Years work experience as a programmer</li><li>Highly Comfortable with C# and Visual Studio</li><li>Experienced with Web Development &amp; JavaScript</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About MapLarge            </h2>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our platform powers high traffic website visualizations, data discovery, and business intelligence applications.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75K-100K (Mid-Level) and $100-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates within a 3 hour drive of Louisville, KY are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

The thought of solving a problem in an entirely new programming language, one you have never even heard of before, excites you.</li><li><strong>Technical Diversity</strong>: while we all have our preferences when it comes to programming languages or operating systems, you should be willing to work with anything, in any language, if that’s what it takes to get the job done. If you are easily lead into a “______ rocks, everything else sucks” mentality, this isn’t the job for you.</li><li><strong>Flexible</strong>: we are small, things change.

We're Scripto, the software company that The New Yorker recently called &quot;<a href='https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-scripto-the-app-that-stephen-colbert-helped-build-became-a-fixture-of-late-night-comedy-news' rel='nofollow'>a fixture of late-night comedy news</a>.&quot; It was a great start to the year, but we have even bigger plans, and we hope you'll apply to join us as a Developer. You'll be working on Showrunner, our next-generation product for screenwriters, sketch groups, sitcoms, and films.</p><p>We're looking for someone who enjoys the challenge of connecting users to APIs in an elegant and friendly way; you should be excited at the prospect of architecting and then implementing new mission-critical features that play well with our existing systems. Here's a partial list of the technologies we use every day: Choo, Nanocomponent, Codemirror, Bankai, Take-Five, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, CommonJS, and Node (6, moving to 8). You don't have to know all of those cold, even our CTO picked up (or&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/scriptoLLC/take-five' rel='nofollow'>created</a>!) some of them here at Scripto. What we'd like to see from you is 3-5 years of production JS experience, with a record of shipping software and learning on the fly. You should easily be able to point to complete projects you've devised and built, like features of a large package, or whole apps if they’re on the smaller side. Your work doesn't have to be open-source or public, but it should have real users and stakes.</p><p>We are a proudly remote company with flexible hours and health, dental, and vision benefits. We hire inclusively and value diversity. It should be noted, this position is only open to candidates in the USA. To apply, please&nbsp;submit a résumé and cover letter&nbsp;– we can't wait to hear from you.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Scripto            </h2>            <div><p>Scripto began in the early 2010s at the Colbert Report, when writer (and CEO) <a href='https://twitter.com/robdubbin' rel='nofollow'>Rob Dubbin</a> thought there&nbsp;should be a better way for the dozens of people who made&nbsp;the show every day to collaborate. It is now&nbsp;a&nbsp;thriving enterprise product whose clients have won the last&nbsp;six consecutive Emmys for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Writing_for_a_Variety_Series' rel='nofollow'>Outstanding Writing in a Comedy/Variety Series</a>.

But if you are in any doubt the type of experiences we expect you to have then the following should help clarify;</p><p><strong>Kibana is the window into the Elastic Stack</strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Innovate, lead and contribute to front end and GIS visualization experience of the Kibana and other UI products using JavaScript</li><li>Collaborate with other development teams, quality engineering team, and documentation team to execute on product work</li></ul><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience in web mapping and spatial application development including web mapping libraries (OpenLayers, Mapbox, Leaflet) and spatially-enabled relational databases</li><li>Experience creating highly visual web apps, using D3.js and similar libraries</li><li>Strong JavaScript programming skills</li><li>7+ years of front end development work</li><li>Experience with one modern MVC style JS Framework</li><li>Experience writing automated tests</li><li>Ability to work in a fast paced start-up environment</li><li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills, a great teammate with strong analytical, problem solving, debugging and troubleshooting skills</li><li>Strong preference for operational experience</li><li>Strong preference for knowledge of building complex data visualization and related tooling</li><li>Strong preference for Open Source experience</li></ul><p><strong>To be considered, please include a short note as to why you are a fit for this role at Elastic!</strong></p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Elastic            </h2>            <div><p>Elastic is the world's leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security, and analytics use cases.

Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.</p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and&nbsp;<a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement.</p><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a>&nbsp;with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel&nbsp;way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d&nbsp;<a href='https://cl.ly/2i0V3z453H2K' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use&nbsp;the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. Here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Micro-service backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a true full-stack developer that can build a features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile). Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Trajectory </strong></p><p>The main thing we care about is shipping great products that have an impact on education. But we hire for skills and attitude over experience, so we wanted to share our thoughts on <a href='https://cl.ly/0k062R1T1R3V' rel='nofollow'>the path you’ll have within Aula</a>. This framework will also form the basis of your one-on-ones. The timeline is just indicative: for experienced developers it might be much, much quicker - either way, we’ll support you to get there as fast as humanly possible.</p><p><strong>Benefits </strong></p><p>We hope you’ll join us for the mission, the work and the people. But hey… </p><p><strong> Work on hard and important problems </strong>with people who care.</p><p><strong>  &nbsp;Focus on your trajectory, not just your role. </strong>Dedicate 3 hours a week to building the skills and connections you’ll need for your dream position at Aula in 3 years.</p><p> &nbsp;<strong>Shared ownership: </strong>Joining the Aula journey means you will own part of the company.</p><p><strong> &nbsp;Learning &amp; Development stipend: </strong>Receive a small stipend for any training you would like to do in your spare time.</p><p><strong> &nbsp;Work remotely: </strong>Our developers have full flexibility to live and work wherever they please.</p><p><strong> &nbsp;Technology: </strong>Get hooked up with the technology to do your best work.</p><p> &nbsp;<strong>Free books:</strong> We’re all about books. We’ll send you as many as you can read.</p><p> &nbsp;<strong>Family Leave:</strong> If your family grows while at Aula, we recommend taking 1-3 months off - regardless of when you joined.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>You have both front-end&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;back-end experience</li><li>You have experience with React - unless you have significant Javascript experience with other libraries, so that you’ll be able to pick it up quickly</li><li>You have experience creating and iterating on products from end-to-end: we think there are certain things that freelance and agency work doesn’t teach you such working end-to-end (full feature) on an entire system.</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.</li></ul><p>We’re open to people at different experience levels as long as you feel this description captures you well.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role.

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</a></p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we're building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.</p><p>Interview process:</p><p>Phone Screen -&gt; Technical Homework -&gt; Technical Interviews -&gt; Product Interviews -&gt; Offer!</p><p>Check out our careers page: <a href='https://stackshare.io/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://stackshare.io/careers</a> Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you're emailing us please include your resume and/or LinkedIn profile URL!<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Then we tried to sell this product and quickly realized that we need a data-visualization layer.</p><p>We're hiring someone primarily to work on our network anomaly detection product -- <a href='https://www.kentik.com/ddos-detection/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.kentik.com/ddos-detection/</a>.

You’ll develop skills that will be useful for the rest of your career and you’ll learn to deal with pressure, stress, and risk. You’ll be pushed beyond your comfort zone, which is where learning really happens. This is why many people learn more in three months at a startup than three years at a big company.<br> In a startup, all you have is a bunch of guesses about what might work in the market, and the focus is on search. It turns out that searching is a lot more fun.<br>Even the “crappy” days at a startup can be fun. The ghetto office, the need to scrape by on a budget, the constant sense that you have no idea what you’re doing can all be terrifying, but also exciting. They teach you to appreciate the small victories in life rather than becoming obsessed with promotions or politics.</p></div>",

    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Senior Back-End Engineer</h2>      <h4>Posted Feb  1</h4>    <h3>      <span>Logikcull</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: San Francisco (Open to Remote) </span><br>        <a href='https://logikcull.com/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://logikcull.com/jobs/</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>You’ve of course heard of Dropbox. You probably use it or a similar service on a daily basis. Now imagine a service where users upload entire email databases, zip files, images, hard drives of content, and pretty much anything they need to search through. Simple enough. That’s what S3 is for, right? But here’s the catch, unlike Dropbox and similar services, Logikcull’s job is to rip the data apart, analyze the hell out of it, and then organize it into logical search buckets so that legal teams around the world can easily and quickly sift through it.</div><div><br></div><div>This of course requires massive computing, massive storage, and an ever expanding infrastructure to support them all. Our challenges are a unique mix of broad and deep because the data we need to get at is always mixed up with other data. Emails have attachments, word documents wrap human-readable content in data structures and almost anything can be printed to PDF. Our system has to be smart enough to recognize everything in order to unpack it properly, graceful enough to remember complex relationships between documents and fast enough to rip through gigabytes concurrently at scale.</div><div><br></div><div>And all of this needs to happen at scale, for all of our customers (in 34 different countries and growing),&nbsp;<strong>within minutes or hours from the first upload</strong>. Insane, right?</div><div><br></div><div>It’s controlled chaos at scale and we love it. And here’s why:</div><div><br></div><div>The technical challenges are staggering. And that’s usually enough to keep a top engineer happy for quite some time. But it’s the impact Logikcull is having on our society that is even more rewarding. For instance, governments can now turn around open records requests (i.e. FOIA), within days by using Logikcull. Prior to Logikcull, this process used to take weeks, months, and, we’re not kidding, years, to complete. Blocking government information to citizens lawfully requesting that information is counter to a healthy democracy.</div><div><br></div><div>Another example where Logikcull is having an impact on our society is litigation. To us, litigation can be a means to affect positive change (<a href='http://logikcull.com/blog/into-the-wild-earthjustice-amanda-sharp/' rel='nofollow'>see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves, not a joke</a>) and it allows people of all means to get access to justice. But getting access to justice also means being able to afford litigation. And one of the biggest costs to litigation is sifting through data (i.e. discovery or e-discovery). Logikcull makes it easy, fast, and affordable for anyone to sift through data for litigation, which means that citizens and businesses can not only get access to justice, but also save a ton of money - in some cases, millions of dollars are saved by using Logikcull.

For that, you need a full-fledged JavaScript debugger. The new Firefox JavaScript debugger can help you write fast, bug-free code. Here's how it works.</p><p>In this example, we'll crack open a very simple to-do app with Debugger. <a href='https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/sample-todo/01-variables/' rel='nofollow'>Here's the app</a>, based on basic open-source JavaScript frameworks. Open it up in the latest version of <a href='https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer/' rel='nofollow'>Firefox Developer Edition</a> and then launch <code>debugger.html</code> by hitting Option + Cmd + S on Mac or Shift + Ctrl + S on Windows. The Debugger is divided into three panes: the source list pane, the source pane, and the tool pane.</p>            <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/dd605d5c-e94d-43e3-a7ef-94eea52cff9e/image2.png' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>    <p>The Tools pane is further divided into the toolbar, watch expressions, breakpoints, the call stack, and scopes.</p>            <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2b99b781-28e8-4bff-a5ff-d1ee43c2d432/image3.png' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>          <div>      <div>    <p><em>“You must unlearn what you have learned!”</em> Meet the <strong>brand new episode</strong> of <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/events/san-francisco-2018/' rel='nofollow'>SmashingConf San Francisco</a> with smart front-end tricks and UX techniques.

Just stick a call into your code to find the value of a variable, and you're set, right? Sure, that can work, but it can be cumbersome and time-consuming. In this example, we'll use <code>debugger.html</code> to step through the todo app code to find the value of a variable.</p><p>We can use <code>debugger.html</code> to dive deeper into the todo app by simply adding a breakpoint to a line of code. Breakpoints tell the Debugger to pause on a line so you can click into the code to see what's going on. In this example, we'll add a breakpoint to line 13 of the <code>app.js</code> file.</p>            <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a3633871-65f2-4815-9270-2b5e19b316f4/image5.gif' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>    <p>Now add a task to the list. The code will pause at the addTodo function, and we can dive into the code to see the value of the input and more. Hover over a variable to see the value and more. You can see anchors and applets and children and all sorts of things:</p>            <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/5f23c4d0-5b4d-41ff-9367-e534d0f96168/image4.png' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>    <p>You can also dive into the Scopes panel to get the same info.</p><p>Now that the script is paused, we can step through it using the Toolbar. The play/pause button does just what it says on the tin. &quot;Step Over&quot; steps across the current line of code, &quot;Step In&quot; steps into the function call, and &quot;Step Out&quot; runs the script until the current function exits.</p>            <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2c04dd57-b4b4-42c7-be87-685a71c8df56/image1.png' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>    <p>We can also use a watch expression to keep an eye on the value of a variable. Just type an expression in the Watch Expression field, and the debugger will keep an eye on it as you step through the code. In the example above, you can add the expressions &quot;title&quot; and &quot;to-do&quot; and the debugger will spit out the values when they're available. This is especially useful when:</p><ul><li>You're stepping and want to watch values change;</li><li>You're debugging the same thing many times and want to see common values;</li><li>You're trying to figure out why that damn button won't work.</li></ul>  <div></div><p>You can also use <code>debugger.html</code> to debug your React/Redux apps. Here's how it works:</p><ul><li>Navigate to a component you want to debug.</li><li>See the component outline on the left (functions in the class).</li><li>Add breakpoints to the relevant functions.</li><li>Pause and see component props and state.</li><li>The call stack is simplified so that you see your application code interleaved with the framework.</li></ul><p>Finally, <code>debugger.html</code> lets you see obfuscated or minified code that could be triggering errors, which is especially useful when you're dealing with common frameworks like React/Redux. The Debugger knows about components you're paused in and will show a simplified call stack, component outline, and properties. Here's developer Amit Zur explaining how he uses the Firefox debugger to dive into code at <a href='https://2017.js-kongress.de/' rel='nofollow'>JS Kongress</a>:</p><p>If you're interested in an in-depth walkthrough on the new <code>debugger.html</code>, head over to the <a href='https://mozilladevelopers.github.io/playground/debugger' rel='nofollow'>Mozilla Developer Playground</a>. We've built a tutorial series to help developers learn how to effectively use the tool to debug their code.</p><h4>Open-Source DevTools</h4><p>The <a href='https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html' rel='nofollow'><code>debugger.html</code> project</a> was launched about two years ago along with a full overhaul of all the Firefox DevTools. We wanted to rebuild DevTools using modern web technologies, to open them up to developers around the world. And when a technology is open, it's free to grow beyond anything our small group at Mozilla can imagine.</p><p>JavaScript is essential to any advanced web app, so a strong debugger was a key part of the toolset. We wanted to build something that was fast, easy to use, and adaptable—able to debug any new JavaScript frameworks that may emerge. We decided to use popular web technologies because we wanted to work closer with the community. This approach would also improve the Debugger itself — if we adopted WebPack and started using a build tool and source maps internally, we'd want to improve source mapping and hot reloading.</p><p>The <code>debugger.html</code> is built with React, Redux, and Babel. The React components are lightweight, testable, and easy to design. We use React Storybook for quick UI prototyping and documenting shared components. Our Components are tested with Jest and Enzyme, which make it easier to iterate on top of the UI. This makes it easier to work with various JavaScript frameworks (like React). Our Babel front-end lets us do things like show the Component class and its functions in the left sidebar. We are also able to do cool things like pinning breakpoints to functions, so they don't move when you change your code.</p><p>The Redux actions are a clean API for the UI, but could just as easily be used to build a standalone CLI JS Debugger. The Redux store has selectors for querying the current debugging state. Our redux unit test fires Redux actions and simulates browser responses. Our integration tests drive the browser with debugger Redux actions. The functional architecture itself is designed to be testable.</p><p>We relied on the Mozilla developer community every step of the way. The project was posted on <a href='https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html' rel='nofollow'>GitHub</a> and our team reached out to developers worldwide to help out. When we started, automated tests were a critical component for community development. Tests prevent regressions and document behavior that's easy to miss. This is why one of the first steps we took was to add unit tests for Redux actions and Flow types for the Redux store. In fact, the community ensured that our Flow and Jest coverage would help make sure every file was typed and tested.</p><p>As developers, we believe tools are stronger the more people are involved. Our core team has always been small (2 people), but we average 15 contributors a week. The community brings a diversity of perspectives that helps us anticipate challenges and build features we would not have dreamed of. We now format call stacks for 24 different libraries, many of which we had never heard of. We also show WebPack and Angular maps in the source tree.</p><p>We plan to move all the Firefox DevTools to GitHub so they can be used and improved by a wider audience. We'd love for you to contribute. Head over to our GitHub project page for <code><a href='https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html' rel='nofollow'>debugger.html</a></code> to get started. We've created a full list of instructions on how to run the debugger on your own machine, where you can modify it to do whatever you'd like. Use it to debug JavaScript code for anything — browsers, terminals, servers, phones, robots. And if you see ways to improve it, let us know via GitHub.</p><p><em>You can download the latest version of Firefox (and DevTools) over <a href='https://www.mozilla.org/firefox' rel='nofollow'>here</a>.</em></p><div>    <span>(rb, ra, yk, il)</span></div>  <div></div></div>            </div>        </div>                 <div>            <div>                                                </div>        </div>                    <div></div>                </div>     <div>        <div>            <div>    <h5>Browse All Smashing Magazine Topics</h5>    <ul>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Accessibility</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Android</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Animation</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Apps</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>CSS</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Design</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Design Patterns</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Design Systems</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>E-Commerce</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Freebies</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Graphics</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>HTML</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Illustrator</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Inspiration</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>iOS</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>JavaScript</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Mobile</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Pattern Libraries</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Performance</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Photoshop</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Plugins</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>React</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Responsive Web Design</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Service Workers</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Sketch</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Typography</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>UI</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Usability</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>User Experience</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Wallpapers</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Web Design</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>WordPress</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Workflow</a>        </li>          </ul></div>        </div>        <div>            <div>                <p>With a commitment to quality content for the design community.</p>                <p>Founded by Vitaly Friedman and Sven Lennartz. <span>2006–2018</span>.</p>                <p>Smashing is proudly running on <a href='http://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=smashing&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=footer' rel='nofollow'>Netlify</a>.</p>                <p>Fonts by <a href='http://latinotype.com/' rel='nofollow'>Latinotype</a>.</p>            </div>            <ul>                <li>✎ <a rel='nofollow'>Write for us</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>Contact us</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>About us (Impressum)</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>Privacy policy</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>Membership login</a></li>                <li><a href='mailto:markus.seyfferth@smashingmagazine.com?subject=Let’s talk about advertising' rel='nofollow'>Advertise</a></li>            </ul>        </div>    </div>    <div>    <a title=&quot;Back to top&quot; rel='nofollow'>                    Back to top                                    </a></div>    <div></div>  <div></div>                  ",
