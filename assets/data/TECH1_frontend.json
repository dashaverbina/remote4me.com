You turn on your monitor and join the hangout for your daily Standup. Call done, you hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone's day you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></strong></p><p>At nearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

You’ll be an integral part of our product and engineering teams focused on architecting and developing our client-side programming.</p><p>We’re looking for a strong track record of architecting and building products. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>*What You'll Do*<br>* Lead development on the client layer and user experience.<br>* Develop a comprehensive HTML/CSS/JS framework for rendering web applications for multiple devices and themes.<br>* Refine the application building experience that makes it a delight for our customers to use and extend Knack.<br>* Consistently improve the speed, reliability, and performance of the Knack client application.<br>* Evaluate new technologies and help determine opportunities to leverage these.<br>* Work on implementing front-end Knack features.</p><p>How you’ll do this:<br>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our small engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*About You*<br>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You’re an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You’re not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers.</p><p>You have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in.

We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>So why are we different?</p><p>We’re bootstrapped: we’ve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things.</p><p>We’re 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.</p><p>We’re small: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars-- we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.</p><p>We enjoy the journey: we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*<br>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You’ll get forced days off for birthdays and knackiversaries.</p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p><p>Please note that we are only considering applicants legally eligible to work in the US.</p></div>",

We are a small team of remote developers in India working along with the product team in NY. Dev team - 4. Overall company size - 12.</p><p>What: We’ve developed a web-based app designed to interest students and make them more successful at reading. It provides teachers with detailed analytics to drive learning intervention. We're now working on scaling the product and providing advanced features to aid student learning and empower teachers with more tools to help them see how to guide their students.</p><p>Why: We don’t do it just because it’s interesting (though it is). We do it because we’re obsessed with solving one of the most catastrophic, under-acknowledged problems in the US and the world: year after year, students graduate high school without being able to read at the level that is required for success in college and in life.</p><p>Where: New York, Bangalore &amp; other Indian cities.</p><p>Apply to us through AngelList:<a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-en...</a><a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engin...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

We are at a stage where our interest lies in finding founding team members. We will happily expose you to strategy, planning and the entire foundation of the business if and when required.</p><p>The right person is not afraid to shake things up or speak up when needed. They will stand their ground when they know they are right, and learn from it when they are wrong. </p><p>Technical skills are important, but making sure everyone in the team gets along is even more. We work in a distributed environment, so working alone, using technology for discussions and managing your own time are added challenges you will have to deal with.</p><p>Now, we also realise that these kind of people don’t just turn up out of the blue. So we are always on the lookout and are planning to grow based on people, not hire based on growth. In return, you must be committed, and anything measured in months will be considered insufficient.</p><p>Finally; if your only goal in life is to make a difference and genuinely help wineries, you really should get in touch. Otherwise, if this sounds like a means to an end, you can simply head over here: <a href='https://w.troly.io/u3is8' rel='nofollow'>https://w.troly.io/u3is8</a></p></div>",

But lawyers are terribly served by traditional recruitment agencies, who rely on anonymised web ads or inexperienced cold callers to engage potential legal recruits.<br /><br />Our founders, Tom Balmer and David Crocker, have been involved in the establishment and growth of some of the best names in the legal recruitment industry since the early noughties.  In 2017 they launched Third Way Legal, a marketplace platform designed to change the way lawyers engage with the jobs market.<br /><br />Third Way is a unique network, where lawyers can confidentially see which firms are looking for lawyers like them (in some ways it is similar to workinginstartups.com!). Following an amazing first year, where we have grown to 6 people and are annualising a million in turnover, we now are looking to build an in-house tech team.<br /><br />It's an extremely exciting time to join the business.  We are expanding into the interim market, looking to grow into new geographies, and have so many new feature ideas it hurts.  We're looking for a full-stack developer, comfortable with front and back end development, who is pragmatic and can eager to grow with the firm.  If that sounds like you, and you'd like to join us on our journey to change the legal recruitment industry, please get in touch!",

You’ll be faced with a huge variety of tasks and you’ll constantly have to learn new things as you go. You might be writing database queries one day, designing a user interface the next day, answering customer service emails the day after that, and putting together an investor pitch deck in between. You’ll develop skills that will be useful for the rest of your career and you’ll learn to deal with pressure, stress, and risk. You’ll be pushed beyond your comfort zone, which is where learning really happens. This is why many people learn more in three months at a startup than three years at a big company.<br> In a startup, all you have is a bunch of guesses about what might work in the market, and the focus is on search. It turns out that searching is a lot more fun.<br>Even the “crappy” days at a startup can be fun. The ghetto office, the need to scrape by on a budget, the constant sense that you have no idea what you’re doing can all be terrifying, but also exciting. They teach you to appreciate the small victories in life rather than becoming obsessed with promotions or politics.</p></div>",

We are also among the first blockchain projects to launch a token as a fully regulated and compliant European security.</p><p>Our founders are responsible for creating CoZ, one of the largest open source blockchain communities (<a href='https://github.com/CityOfZion' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/CityOfZion</a>), where we have created software used by hundreds of thousands of users. Collectively, our team includes PhDs from Stanford and ETH Zurich, YC alumni, and award winning designers.</p><p>Some tech highlights:</p><p>- Elixir for our matching engine</p><p>- React / Redux for our front-end components</p><p>- NEO and Ethereum for smart contracts</p><p>We are looking for front-end and back-end engineers, developers familiar smart contracts, and PhD-level researchers in security or distributed systems.

Think of the Union platform as a way for folks running programs like 500 Startups (they run on Union) or startup challenges at organizations like Comcast or the DoD (they also run on Union) to organize themselves, between calendaring, discussion management, learning tools, and event management.</p><p><i></i>Our stack and processes:<i></i> Union is Rails, React, Redis, Postgres, Elasticsearch. We run on AWS, and our operations are powered by Ansible. We use scrum because it provides just enough process to make us productive, but we try to avoid some of the major pitfalls by letting our whole team chime in on the process. We do continuous integration and delivery.</p><p><i></i>Our team:<i></i> We are a small, lean team and you would play a big part on how we work. We have some very experienced folks on the team but our minds aren’t set in stone. Help us define how to make you work at your best. Our organization is diverse, and we’re at about a 50/50 split between men and women org-wide.</p><p><i></i>Remote friendly:<i></i> We have parts of our org in DC, Portugal and Dubai. We’re open to people from anywhere but would love not to stretch our timezone span too much. But obviously we’ll make an exception for the right candidate(s).</p><p><i></i>Have questions?<i></i> Feel free to ask here, or just email me!</p><p>Send me an email.

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.</p><p>We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.</p><p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]</p><p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.</p><p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.</p><p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].</p><p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href='https://www.noredink.com/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/jobs</a></p><p>[1] <a href='https://www.noredink.com/about/team' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/about/team</a></p><p>[2] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/</a></p><p>[3] <a href='https://github.com/NoRedInk/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/NoRedInk/</a></p><p>[4] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan</a></p><p>[5] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...</a></p><p>[6] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects while concurrently laying the foundation for a stand-alone product which will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We have an excellent four person team in place with Big-4 backend experience. We're looking to get one final person in place to help us define what a modern and maintainable front-end stack should look like and to help build our product. Hopefully that's you.</p><p>Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we aren't as familiar with. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

As a front-end engineer you should always work with a strong focus on end-users and build Kopernio to enable them to do their research. <br /> <br />Your primary responsibility will be the development of the Kopernio browser extension, ensuring that researchers can get seamless access to journal article across hundreds of different online platforms. <br /> <br />About you <br /><br />● You have proven expertise developing, releasing and maintaining complex Javascript (ES6) applications <br />● Ideally you have built cross-browser applications using the Web Extensions framework <br />● You build secure web applications following modern web development practices <br />● You should be comfortable with version control systems (git) <br />● Some knowledge of Python web frameworks is a plus, but not essential <br />● You value a culture where the quality of code is as important as time-to-market <br />● You have a history of building and taking products to market in fast-paced environments<br /> ● You enjoy acquiring new skills and expertise as required by the project <br />● You have a bias for simplicity, scalability, robustness and maintainability in code and systems <br />● You design architectures which allow rapid iterations whilst considering future requirements and the big picture when planning and developing new applications and features <br />● You have great team skills, including the confidence to put your idea across, even if the idea is initially unpopular, and the humility to admit when you are wrong <br /><br /> <br />Responsibilities <br /><br />● Full lifecycle (ideation, building and deploying) responsibility for the Kopernio plugin <br />● Serve as the initial point of escalation for software development issues within your area of responsibility <br />● Interface with other technical team members to finalise requirements <br /> <br /> <br />About us <br /><br />We are a team of successful entrepreneurs and engineers, having built several companies in our field that have had a major impact on science, and with Kopernio we’re doing it again. It is a true start-up where a “can-do” attitude is valued more than any process, and where we want to push boundaries by breaking things. We put a strong emphasis on working independently and creatively, trying to find solutions to complex problems in an iterative way. You will be exposed to the world of start-ups, yet we will be clear on our purpose and objectives to advance science and help scientists to become more efficient. <br /> <br />As we grow, we are committed to building cohesive teams where communication, support and innovation thrives. We expect the team to actively contribute ideas and proactively take decisions in the interest of Kopernio and our users. <br /> <br /> ",

There’s no hype, we simply sell a great product.<br /><br />What are we looking for?<br /><br />We’re looking for a mid-to-senior-level full stack developer to work directly with me, the founder, and our CTO and UI designer to develop new features for Appraisd. Most of the work will be focused on the back-end but front-end skills are desirable too.<br /><br />There will be plenty of discussion and debate, so if you’re looking to grow and learn, this is the place to be. I personally see this as a vital role and am excited about the prospect of someone filling the seat.<br /><br />Skills needed – minimum 5 years professional experience<br /><br />- C# .NET MVC and WebApi, EF, SimpleInjector, Visual Studio, SQL, Azure etc.<br />- Native HTML, LESS or SCSS<br />- Native JS, VueJS, Angular/AngularJS, Typescript a bonus<br />- Bootstrap 2.3 and 3 experience<br />- Git<br />- Excellent communications skills, ability to think beyond the work beyond the backlog and be a part of the overall strategy<br />- Appraisd is responsive so you’ll need to write both for desktop and mobile – although most of our users view Appraisd on their desktops.<br /><br />We can we offer you?<br /><br />We’ll pay you a great wage and you’ll work in our very friendly and attractive Kentish Town warehouse office with our small but happy and enthusiastic team. Remote work for 1-2 days per week will be considered - or if you want to go off for a week to code from a cafe in Berlin that's fine too, and why not!<br /><br />We have various perks here and there but to be honest I think what’s most important is that you can see the impact of your work, develop your skills and be inspired by others around you – and all this I can guarantee.<br /><br />To get the ball rolling, please get in touch with your CV plus examples of work you’ve done already. Please also let us know…<br /><br />– what frameworks and libraries you’ve used before or are interested in<br />– any Codepen/Github stuff you’ve done or SO profile<br />– an opinion of our website our app<br />– what is your expected salary and availability.<br /><br />To start as soon as possible at our office in Kentish Town.<br /><br />Absolutely no agencies please, we’ve had a lot of success posting jobs like this one and don’t need any help.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Roly<br />Founder<br />Appraisd<br />www.appraisd.com",

We are an online company.</span><br>        <a href='https://gmb.io/' rel='nofollow'>https://gmb.io/</a>      <br>      <a rel='nofollow'>View all GMB jobs →</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>Hi, we’re GMB, and we teach people how to use their bodies better.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span>The word “fitness” has been perverted to mean doing things you hate to impress people you don’t like with a body that’s too tired and sore to do anything fun. We’re here to change that, and we need your help.</span><br></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We started out in 2010 with an email subscription form, a YouTube account, and a lot of scrambling to figure things out. Even with over 40,000 clients in 80 countries, pretty much everything about how we’ve built our company and marketed our products has been bootstrapped by a small group of deeply invested people wearing a lot of hats and learning as we went along. Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</div><div><br></div><div>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and we are looking for a Front-End WP Developer to join GMB, part-time to start. You’ll be part of a team that is helping to imagine and build new products — as well as improve existing ones.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>What will be your responsibilities?</h3></div><ul><li>Working directly with our graphic designer to bring new design to code</li><li>Update and improve existing front-end code</li><li>Potential to work on the next version of our app and be involved in styleguide and UI library creation</li></ul><div><h4>To do this job, you will need:</h4></div><ul><li>Experience bringing WordPress themes to code (HTML/CSS/JS)</li><li>Some sense or experience in UX design</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end tools (Gulp, Sass, etc.)</li><li>Experience using git and GitHub workflows</li><li>Familiarity with CSS methodology (SMACSS, BEM, etc.)</li><li>Bonus points for some back-end and API familiarity especially with regard to WordPress</li></ul><div><h4>Other Requirements &amp; Competencies</h4></div><ul><li>You’ve been following GMB for a while and understand what sets us apart from other fitness companies.</li><li>Are clear on the value you’ll bring to the team.</li><li>Know how to follow instructions and how to be creative – and how to choose between them.</li><li>Speak and read/write perfect English.</li><li>Have a sense of humor.</li><li>Always work to develop a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>.</li><li>Good at self-managing.</li><li>Have a strong DIY ethic – know what you don’t know and what you can do about it.</li><li>Can make things happen. You are a doer/maker as well as a planner.</li><li>Can manage written communication with a lot of different people.</li></ul><div>Compensation is competitive and commensurate with experience, but you can get a pretty good sense of our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits and such here</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>What’s it like working at GMB?</h3></div><div>GMB is a kick-ass company.</div><div><br></div><div>GMB is about creating autonomy. We’re working to make the world a better place by teaching people to take control of what their bodies can do so they can contribute to their families and communities. We create options for exploration and self-expression.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>And we work the way we practice. Like our idea of fitness and the way we deliver our programs, very little about the way we work is like what you’d find in a traditional company. Here’s how we exemplify autonomy at work:</div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;<span>Work and Live Anywhere</span></div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;<span>Set Your Own Schedule.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;<span>Create Your Own Role.</span></div><div><br></div><div>We also take care of our people. Building a great team with full autonomy requires more than just freedom; we thrive in an environment that supports development and growth… and we bet you will too. Some of the things we value and encourage are:&nbsp;<span>continuous learning</span>,&nbsp;<span>travel &amp; facetime</span>, as well as&nbsp;<span>time off</span>. Learn more about all our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits here</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>If you like what you’ve read so far, familiarize yourself with who we are and what we’re&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>about</a>&nbsp;before going any further. You should also listen to this interview with Andy about&nbsp;<a href='https://mixergy.com/interviews/gmb-fitness-with-andy-fossett/' rel='nofollow'>how we grew GMB</a>&nbsp;and what’s important to us.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to learn more about the smart, fun people you’ll be working with? Check out our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/team/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><span><span><span></span>&nbsp;<span></span>&nbsp;<span></span></span></span></div><div><h3>How To Apply</h3></div><div>If you’re thinking, “I know how to use an APP; I’d be great at this,” you’re probably wrong.

The ideal person will have solid HTML, CSS and JS skills and be able to craft delightful user experiences in a scalable way.<br><br>This is a position on our design team, which means you will have a big say in how we architect the design system that powers all of our app's UI and UX. With that in mind, we are looking for someone who can do more than just re-create a mockup – We're looking for someone who can think critically and help us create better experiences for our users, while working closely with our full stack developers who are creating the core business logic.<br><br><strong>The kind of work we do</strong><br>BriteCore is essentially a CMS for insurance companies. They use it to manage all aspects of their business, including tracking policies, contacts and handling claims.<br><br>This means our users typically see our app more as a business tool like Microsoft Word or Google Sheets than a website (even though it is completely a web app). They also are using BriteCore for several hours every day, and are concerned with doing things quickly and efficiently. This, along with the complicated nature of insurance, means we deal with some complex workflows, and try to set ourselves apart from our competitors with a smooth UX that helps them navigate these tough processes.<br><br><strong>What you might be doing</strong><br>We're looking for someone who can really help us take our frontend system to the next level, and this includes things like:</p><ul><li>Creating, in collaboration with designers, a modular, scalable design system that can be used by other developers to quickly and consistently build out new features.</li><li>Implementing a robust hotkey system, to allow our users to quickly accomplish tasks in the app.</li><li>Help us implement better user analytics, and eventually allow us to A/B test new features/designs.</li></ul><p><br><strong>What it is like to work here</strong><br>BriteCore is a remote-first company — even employees who live in our home city of Springfield, MO usually work from home! And most of the people you will work with are scattered across the US and the globe. This means that remote team members are just as much part of the company as local employees. We also allow a lot of flexibility in terms of time off. In return, we expect all of our employees to be productive and accountable, which means you'll work alongside a great, dedicated team.<br><br><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Work alongside designers to implement features, with a focus on great UX.&nbsp;</li><li>Have a keen sense for what makes an attractive UI</li><li>Structure and develop code in a component-driven, scalable way</li><li>Have a thorough understanding of HTML/CSS/JS best practices.</li><li>Communicate clearly</li><li>Welcome feedback and collaboration</li><li>Be friendly, confident, and patient with others</li><li>Self-direct</li><li>Stay up on industry best practices and trends</li></ul><p><br><strong>Technologies We Use</strong></p><ul><li>Vue.js (Experience with Vue, or another frontend JS framework is required)</li><li>SCSS</li><li>PostCSS</li><li>HTML5</li><li>Webpack</li><li>Github, various CLI tools</li></ul><p><br><strong>Benefits and Compensation</strong></p><ul><li>$50k-$70k based on experience and proven performance</li><li>Benefit from working alongside and observing a team of world-class engineers and designers</li><li>Comprehensive health insurance coverage including medical, dental, and vision for US-based applicants</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>Relaxed work environment</li><li>Remote work</li><li>Flexible learning time — explore your ideas and new technologies on the clock</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About BriteCore            </h2>            <div><p>At BriteCore, we build gorgeous, scalable, and usable cloud-based insurance software.

You turn on your monitor and join the hangout for your daily Standup. Call done, you hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone's day you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></strong></p><p>At nearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

We have systems to signal busy-ness; regular meetings and stand-ups to disseminate information, frequent one-on-ones to ensure there are no frustrations building up, a code of conduct and a formal complaint process to resolve conflicts early-on.</span></p><p><strong>As a key member of our front-end team, you’ll:</strong></p><ul><li><span>Implemented requirements provided by the UX developer</span></li><li><span>Tackle difficult coding problems like caching and concurrency</span></li><li><span>Write effective high-quality code with a focus on performance and maintainability</span></li><li><span>Improve our architecture</span></li><li><span>Maintain and optimize our front-end build processes</span></li><li><span>Create reliable tests and work closely with our QA team for end-to-end testing</span></li></ul><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li><span>You thrive in a self-directed and open work environment.

We use what we know best. Windows, Mac, Linux, whatever you like</span></li><li><span>We provide you with a tools budget that you can use to make yourself productive ($300 per purchase, no authorization needed)</span></li><li><span>We know learning is a must on and off the job.

A company you’ve heard of before, or maybe not, but either way you’ve landed on this page because you were at least a little curious, and we like that about you. We spend our time making it easier for SMBs to talk with their customers. Today Help Scout is used by more than 8,000 businesses in 140 countries.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for someone who’s really smart, and humble, and thorough, and meticulous, and self-motivated, and kind, and a little funny, and tenacious, and did I say self-motivated? Well, that’s because we’re a remote company! Being remote is fantastic, it’s empowering, and it’s perfect for people who like to be their own boss and push themselves to be at their very best every day. It’s also perfect for people who hate wearing pants or enjoy going out for ice cream at 4:18pm because it was nice outside and they just felt like it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>That’s where you come in! If you’re a Front-end Engineer with those qualities, chances are you would love to work at Help Scout.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About you</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><ul><li>You love writing beautiful, scalable, semantic HTML and CSS. As a matter of fact, it’s what you are best at.<br></li><li>You have a love for design and are at your best partnering with designers to bring a project to life. You take Sketches and Sketch files, transform them into fully-functioning code, making sure every pixel and interaction is perfect and up to spec.<br></li><li>You love to build things that are intuitive for everyone to use, and you understand that whenever possible, code shouldn’t constrain creativity.<br></li><li>You are comfortable writing basic JavaScript from scratch, not just implementing a jQuery plugin you found online.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Your eye for animation and motion is as strong as your eye for a static design. You have a real knack for implementing these sorts of enhancements as a design comes together.<br></li><li>You’re a systems thinker, passionate about writing code that scales and stands the test of time. Most importantly, it’s code anyone can understand and enhance without asking you for help.<br></li><li>You’re always looking for new ways to stay on top of your craft as the industry evolves.&nbsp;<br></li><li>You are pretty psyched about tools like Seed and Jekyll, a couple of open source projects that power our website. We sure do like them a lot.<br></li><li>The idea of helping to move our business forward on three vectors — Growth, Content, and Brand — is really exciting and empowering to you.<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>About the role</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><ul><li>This role sits on the Design team, not Engineering. Although you love to code, the design/interaction side of things has always been your specialty. We believe code, animation, and interactions are just as central to the design as the pixels are.<br></li><li>You’ll be spending the majority of your time working on our marketing website, creating new pages, re-working old ones, and generally helping us create a brand experience that resonates with people so much that they want to be a customer.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Sure, you’ll be writing a lot of code. But we also need someone who can take a step back, see the bigger picture, and look to make an impact on the business as a whole, driving sales, building a beautiful brand that stands out and creates an emotional connection with people.<br></li><li>On a daily basis you’ll be collaborating with folks from Design and Growth teams, but your tasks will very widely! One day you might be building a new feature page alongside a designer. The next day you might be writing some JavaScript to improve our lightweight A/B testing framework. The next day you might be writing documentation for our style guide or creating PRs to improve Seed. You might even pitch in to create some prototypes for our product every once in a while.<br></li><li>You'll also have freedom to refactor, implement changes, or develop processes that you feel like will benefit everyone’s workflow. The work you do will help many of your teammates be at their best and work efficiently. Pretty exciting, right?<br></li><li>Since you'll be the most technical person working on the marketing site, many folks will lean on you for advice and direction. You’ll help them level up their coding skills, familiarize them with the codebase, and empower them to work more independently.<br></li><li>You'll often be responsible for driving(or co-driving) projects forward, communicating with others about tasks and milestones. Your perfectionist tendencies lead you to be quite organized, and a pleasure to work with.<br></li></ul><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Bonus points</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Our marketing site is powered by a single Jekyll instance, which has a complicated build process. It's a delicate dance between tools like Node.js, Ruby, Gulp and some other packages to optimize our website for flexibility, speed, and scale. Having experience with these sorts of environments would be tremendously helpful.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Benefits</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><ul><li>Competitive Salary - We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well. The formula we use to calculate all salaries is public to employees and is improved upon regularly.<br></li><li>Work anywhere - Work from our office in Boston or anywhere else, provided you have 4 hours of overlap with the team. We’ll even buy your home office furniture or help you pay for a co-working space.<br></li><li>Health and dental insurance - We cover you and your family's health/dental insurance 100%. If you are based in the US, we'll cover you on our Aetna policy.<br></li><li>Long-term/Short-term Disability Insurance &amp; Life Insurance - we cover 100% of the premiums for LT/ST Disability insurance and base Life Insurance. You also have the option to purchase supplementary life insurance through our provider.<br></li><li>International Benefit Stipend - If you’re based outside the US, you’ll receive a monthly stipend that goes towards covering medical insurance, long and short-term disability, and accountant costs.<br></li><li>Flexible vacation - Take time off when you need it, we trust you.<br></li><li>Paid parental leave, including adoption and foster care - 12 weeks for the primary caretaker and 4 week for the secondary caretaker.<br></li><li>401k with 1% match- 1% Retirement Plan matching for both US and International Employees<br></li><li>Personal development stipend - Up to $1,800 per year to improve your craft<br></li><li>Great tools - Each employee receives a Mac laptop and 27'' display (or equivalent). We’ll also purchase any of the software or hardware you need as well as high-end furniture to get your home office started<br></li><li>Complete transparency - Everyone has full access to business metrics and financial information about the company.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>About Us</b></div><div><br></div><div>Help Scout is made by roughly 70 people in 40+ cities around the world, all with a passion for excellence in their craft.</div><div><br></div><div>We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences.</div><div><br></div><div>Since launching in April of 2011, Help Scout now powers 8,000+ support teams in over 140 countries. Our software is used and trusted by businesses of every shape and size.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Designed to go the distance</b></div><div><br></div><div>Our mission is to foster the world’s customer-centric businesses by providing tools that serve customers in the most human, helpful way. While growth is important, team and values are paramount. We’re always striving to do impactful work we’re proud of in lieu of chasing overnight success.</div><div><br></div><div><b>We’re builders without borders</b></div><div><br></div><div>Our entire team is free to work remotely from wherever they choose. We overcome remote challenges through transparency, trust, and video conferencing. The reward is worth the effort—we’ll take talent, skill, and diverse perspectives over local geography any day.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all, we want Help Scout to be a place where passionate people can do their very best work. You won’t find any ping-pong tables or kegerators here. Instead, you’ll be surrounded by driven, supportive teammates who will push you to be better. We take work/life harmony seriously, too, as we want every career at Help Scout to be a long and satisfying one.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</b></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p><a href='https://jobs.lever.co/helpscout/8be68f5f-fa11-468e-b35d-7247a4921564' rel='nofollow'>https://jobs.lever.co/helpscout/8be68f5f-fa11-468e-b35d-7247a4921564</a></p>  </div>",

Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop.

The ideal person will have solid HTML, CSS and JS skills and be able to craft delightful user experiences in a scalable way.<br><br>This is a position on our design team, which means you will have a big say in how we architect the design system that powers all of our app's UI and UX. With that in mind, we are looking for someone who can do more than just re-create a mockup – We're looking for someone who can think critically and help us create better experiences for our users, while working closely with our full stack developers who are creating the core business logic.<br><br><strong>The kind of work we do</strong><br>BriteCore is essentially a CMS for insurance companies. They use it to manage all aspects of their business, including tracking policies, contacts and handling claims.<br><br>This means our users typically see our app more as a business tool like Microsoft Word or Google Sheets than a website (even though it is completely a web app). They also are using BriteCore for several hours every day, and are concerned with doing things quickly and efficiently. This, along with the complicated nature of insurance, means we deal with some complex workflows, and try to set ourselves apart from our competitors with a smooth UX that helps them navigate these tough processes.<br><br><strong>What you might be doing</strong><br>We're looking for someone who can really help us take our frontend system to the next level, and this includes things like:</p><ul><li>Creating, in collaboration with designers, a modular, scalable design system that can be used by other developers to quickly and consistently build out new features.</li><li>Implementing a robust hotkey system, to allow our users to quickly accomplish tasks in the app.</li><li>Help us implement better user analytics, and eventually allow us to A/B test new features/designs.</li></ul><p><br><strong>What it is like to work here</strong><br>BriteCore is a remote-first company — even employees who live in our home city of Springfield, MO usually work from home! And most of the people you will work with are scattered across the US and the globe. This means that remote team members are just as much part of the company as local employees. We also allow a lot of flexibility in terms of time off. In return, we expect all of our employees to be productive and accountable, which means you'll work alongside a great, dedicated team.<br><br><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Work alongside designers to implement features, with a focus on great UX.&nbsp;</li><li>Have a keen sense for what makes an attractive UI</li><li>Structure and develop code in a component-driven, scalable way</li><li>Have a thorough understanding of HTML/CSS/JS best practices.</li><li>Communicate clearly</li><li>Welcome feedback and collaboration</li><li>Be friendly, confident, and patient with others</li><li>Self-direct</li><li>Stay up on industry best practices and trends</li></ul><p><br><strong>Technologies We Use</strong></p><ul><li>Vue.js (Experience with Vue, or another frontend JS framework is required)</li><li>SCSS</li><li>PostCSS</li><li>HTML5</li><li>Webpack</li><li>Github, various CLI tools</li></ul><p><br><strong>Benefits and Compensation</strong></p><ul><li>$50k-$70k based on experience and proven performance</li><li>Benefit from working alongside and observing a team of world-class engineers and designers</li><li>Comprehensive health insurance coverage including medical, dental, and vision for US-based applicants</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>Relaxed work environment</li><li>Remote work</li><li>Flexible learning time — explore your ideas and new technologies on the clock</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About BriteCore            </h2>            <div><p>At BriteCore, we build gorgeous, scalable, and usable cloud-based insurance software.

In a world where we live with devices that last only a few months or a few years maybe, where we buy stuff to throw it away only days or weeks later, the term ‘effort’ gains a new meaning.</p><p>Recently, I was reading <a href='https://www.kinoyoga.com/yogi-assignment-yatnah-effort/' rel='nofollow'>an essay on ‘Yatnah’</a>, ‘Effort’. I spent a lot of time outside in nature in the past weeks and created a small acre to grow some vegetables. I also attended a workshop to learn the craft of grafting fruit trees. When you cut a tree, you realize that our fast-living, short-term lifestyle is very different from how nature works. I grafted a tree that is supposed to grow for decades now, and if you cut a tree that has been there for forty years, it’ll take another forty to grow one that will be similarly tall.</p><p>I’d love that we all try to <strong>create more long-lasting work</strong>, software that works in a decade, and in order to do so, put effort into learning how we can make that happen. So long, I’ll leave you with this quote and a bunch of interesting articles.</p><blockquote>“In our modern world it can be tempting to throw effort away and replace it with a few phrases of positive thinking. But there is just no substitute for practice”.<br><br>— Kino Macgregor</blockquote>      <div>      <div>    <p>Getting the process <em>just</em> right ain't an easy task.

Here’s a <a href='https://medium.com/@anildash/the-missing-building-blocks-of-the-web-3fa490ae5cbc' rel='nofollow'>look at the neglected technologies that were supposed to make it possible</a>.”</li><li>Morten Rand-Hendriksen wrote about <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/using-ethics-in-web-design/' rel='nofollow'>using ethics in web design</a> and what questions we should ask ourselves when suggesting a solution, creating a design, or a new feature. Especially when we think we’re making something ‘smart’, it’s important to put the question whether it actually helps people first.</li><li>A lot of protest and discussion came along with the <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election' rel='nofollow'>Facebook / Cambridge Analytica affair</a>, most of them pointing out the technological problems with Facebook’s permission model. But the crux lies in how Facebook designed their company and which ethical baseline they set. If we don’t want something like this to happen again, <a href='https://medium.com/@helloanselm/you-design-your-service-bc75be48182b' rel='nofollow'>it’s upon us to design the service we want</a>.</li><li>Brendan Dawes shares <a href='http://brendandawes.com/blog/ihearturls' rel='nofollow'>why he thinks URLs are a masterpiece</a> and a user experience by themselves.</li><li>Charlie Owen’s talk transcription of “<a href='https://sonniesedge.co.uk/talks/dear-developer' rel='nofollow'>Dear Developer, The Web Isn’t About You</a>” is a good summary of why we as developers need to think beyond what’s good for us and consider what serves the users and how we can achieve that instead.</li></ul><h4>UI/UX</h4><ul><li>B. Kaan Kavuştuk shares his thoughts about why we won’t be able to build a perfect design or codebase on the first try, no matter how much experience we have. Instead, it’s <a href='https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/designer-perfection/' rel='nofollow'>the constant small improvements that pave the way to perfection</a>.</li><li>Trine Falbe <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/ethical-design-practical-getting-started-guide/' rel='nofollow'>introduces us to Ethical Design</a> with a practical getting-started guide. It shows alternatives and things to think about when building a business or product. It doesn’t matter much if you’re the owner, a developer, a designer or a sales person, this is about serving users and setting the ground for real and sustainable trust.</li><li>Josh Lovejoy shares his <a href='https://design.google/library/fair-not-default/' rel='nofollow'>learnings from working on inclusive tech solutions</a> and why it takes more than good intention to create fair, inclusive technology. This article goes into depth of why human judgment is very difficult and often based on bias, and why it isn’t easy to design and develop algorithms that treat different people equally because of this.</li><li>The HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) color system isn’t especially new, but a lot of people still don’t understand its advantages. Erik D. Kennedy <a href='https://learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html' rel='nofollow'>explains its principles and advantages</a> step-by-step.</li><li>While there’s more discussion about inclusive design these days, it’s often seen under the accessibility hat or as technical decisions. Robert del Prado now shares <a href='https://www.invisionapp.com/blog/design-inclusive/' rel='nofollow'>how important inclusive design thinking is</a> and why it’s much more about the generic user than some specific people with specific disabilities. Inclusive design brings people together, regardless of who they are, where they live, and what they can afford. And isn’t it the goal of every product to be successful by acquiring as many people as possible? Maybe we need to discuss this with marketing people as well.</li><li>Anton Lovchikov shares ways to <a href='https://blog.prototypr.io/optical-adjustments-in-components-a7f1f8655e0' rel='nofollow'>improve optical adjustments in components</a>. It’s an interesting study on how very small changes can make quite a difference.</li></ul><a href='https://design.google/library/fair-not-default/' rel='nofollow'></a>Afraid or angry? Which emotion we think the baby is showing depends on whether we think it’s a girl or a boy. Josh Lovejoy explains <a href='https://design.google/library/fair-not-default/' rel='nofollow'>how personal bias and judgments like this one lead to unfair products</a>. (<a href='https://design.google/library/fair-not-default/' rel='nofollow'>Image credit</a>)<h4>Tooling</h4><ul><li>Brian Schrader found an unknown feature in Git which is very helpful to test ideas quickly: <a href='https://brianschrader.com/archive/gits-hidden-feature-notes/' rel='nofollow'>Git Notes</a> lets us add, remove, or read notes attached to objects, without touching the objects themselves and without needing to commit the current state.</li><li>For many projects, I prefer to use npm scripts over calling gulp or direct webpack tasks. Michael Kühnel <a href='http://michael-kuehnel.de/tooling/2018/03/22/helpers-and-tips-for-npm-run-scripts.html' rel='nofollow'>shares some useful tricks for npm scripts</a>, including how to allow CLI option parameters or how to watch tasks and alert notices on error.</li><li>Anton Sten explains why <a href='https://www.antonsten.com/newtools/' rel='nofollow'>new tools don’t always equal productivity</a>. We all love new design tools, and new ones such as Sketch, Figma, Xd, or Invision Studio keep popping up. But despite these tools solving a lot of common problems and making some things easier, productivity is mostly about what works for your problem and not what is newest. If you need to create a static mockup and Photoshop is what you know best, why not use it?</li><li>There’s a <a href='https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/' rel='nofollow'>new, fast DNS service available by Cloudflare</a>. Finally, a better alternative to the much used Google DNS servers, it is available under <code>1.1.1.1</code>. The new DNS is the fastest, and probably one of the most secure ones, too, out there. Cloudflare put a lot of effort into encrypting the service and partnering up with Mozilla to make DNS over HTTPS work to close a big privacy gap that until now leaked all your browsing data to the DNS provider.</li><li>I heard a lot about iOS machine learning already, but despite the interesting fact that they’re able to do this on the device without sending everything to a cloud, I haven’t found out how to make use of this for apps, yet. Luckily, Manu Rink put together a nice guide in which she explains <a href='https://medium.com/@codeprincess/machine-learning-in-ios-for-the-noob-6c2cdd04b00b' rel='nofollow'>machine learning in iOS for beginners</a>.</li><li>There’s great news for the Git GUI fans: <a href='https://www.git-tower.com/blog/tower-public-beta-2018-whats-new' rel='nofollow'>Tower now offers a new beta version</a> that includes pull request support, interactive rebase workflows, quick actions, reflog, and search. An amazing update that makes working with the software much faster than before, and even for me as a command line lover it’s a nice option.</li></ul><a href='https://medium.com/@codeprincess/machine-learning-in-ios-for-the-noob-6c2cdd04b00b' rel='nofollow'></a>Manu Rink shows <a href='https://medium.com/@codeprincess/machine-learning-in-ios-for-the-noob-6c2cdd04b00b' rel='nofollow'>how machine learning in iOS works</a> by building an offline handwritten text recognition. (<a href='https://medium.com/@codeprincess/machine-learning-in-ios-for-the-noob-6c2cdd04b00b' rel='nofollow'>Image credit</a>)<h4>Security</h4><ul><li>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), especially with preloading, has long been considered one of the best security features to ensure that a browser should connect only securely to a hostname. However, advertisers have found a way to track users with HSTS and using it as a persistent cross-site identifier (known as “super cookie”). <a href='https://webkit.org/blog/8146/protecting-against-hsts-abuse/' rel='nofollow'>The WebKit developers reacted now</a>, and in order to protect the privacy of their users, they weakened the reliability of HSTS by limiting the hostname scope and ignoring an HSTS state for subresource requests to blocked domains.</li><li>PagerDuty just published an <a href='https://sudo.pagerduty.com/for_everyone/' rel='nofollow'>open-source version of their internal security training material</a>, full of interesting and easy to understand explanations about common security issues and strategies. This is especially useful as you can give it to people without technical experience.</li><li>Christoph Rumpel shares how he found <a href='https://christoph-rumpel.com/2018/03/content-security-policy-hash-algorithm-and-turbolinks' rel='nofollow'>a way to use his Content Security Policy with the Laravel Response Caching package</a>.</li><li>While Argon2 is the current best practice algorithm to use for hashing (passwords, for example), there are a couple of things developers need to prepare for. For example, <a href='https://dev.to/justyntemme/how-to-dos-yourself-with-argon2-20a4' rel='nofollow'>it’s easy to DOS yourself using Argon2</a>, so you need to rate limit queries.</li><li>James Fisher shares an interesting way to <a href='https://jameshfisher.com/2018/04/07/the-dots-do-matter-how-to-scam-a-gmail-user.html' rel='nofollow'>scam Gmail users, as demonstrated at the example of Netflix</a>.</li></ul><h4>Web Performance</h4><ul><li>This week, a discussion popped up on whether the technique of <a href='https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/compressive-images.html' rel='nofollow'>serving compressive images</a> is still a good idea. Tim Kadlec took it as a trigger to revisit it. He now concludes that <a href='https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2018-03-22-compressive-images-revisited/' rel='nofollow'>we should not use the compressive image technique anymore</a> because of its big memory footprint and rely on new responsive image technologies such as the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element or <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes instead.</li><li>Eric Portis shares the under-the-hood principles of the <code>w</code> descriptors and <code>sizes</code> attribute for images. A pretty technical but revealing post that makes you <a href='https://beta.observablehq.com/@eeeps/w-descriptors-and-sizes-under-the-hood' rel='nofollow'>finally understand the magic behind these new responsive image attributes</a>.</li><li>Tim Oxley shares <a href='http://blog.timoxley.com/post/47041269194/avoid-else-return-early' rel='nofollow'>why he prefers to return early and avoid <code>else</code></a> wherever possible. This is something I’ve been doing at the beginning of my career, then lost at some point, but returned to it again recently. Especially the reduced complexity and simpler logic in functions is a key advantage for me here.</li><li>Jeremy Wagner shares best practices on <a href='https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/lazy-loading-guidance/images-and-video/' rel='nofollow'>how to build a lazy loading mechanism for images and videos</a>. It’s definitely not the quickest solution but the resource shares how to build the best experience and performance based on the latest technologies available in browsers.</li></ul><h4>Accessibility</h4><ul><li>Marcy Sutton explains <a href='https://www.deque.com/blog/axe-3-0-has-arrived/' rel='nofollow'>what’s new in Axe 3.0</a> which now supports Shadow DOM and which you can run in your automated test suite.</li><li>Patrick H. Laucke shares <a href='https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2018/03/focus-visible-and-backwards-compatibility/' rel='nofollow'>what the new <code>:focus-visible</code> CSS pseudo-selector is about</a> and how we need to write it to ensure backwards compatibility with browsers that don’t support it yet.</li><li>Marco Zehe introduces us to the <a href='https://www.marcozehe.de/2018/04/11/introducing-the-accessibility-inspector-in-the-firefox-developer-tools/' rel='nofollow'>new Accessibility Inspector in Firefox Developer Tools</a>. This is great news and helps make inspecting accessibility issues way easier than it used to be.</li></ul><h4>CSS</h4><ul><li>Amber Wilson shares some insights into what it feels like to be thrown into a complex project in order to do the styling there. She rightly says that “<a href='https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/nobody-said-css-is-easy/' rel='nofollow'>nobody said CSS is easy</a>” and expresses how important it is that we as developers face inconvenient situations in order to grow our knowledge.</li><li>Ana Tudor is known for her special CSS skills. Now she explores and describes how we can achieve <a href='https://css-tricks.com/scooped-corners-in-2018/' rel='nofollow'>scooped corners in CSS</a> with some clever tricks.</li></ul><a href='https://css-tricks.com/scooped-corners-in-2018/' rel='nofollow'></a>Scooped corners? Ana Tudor shows <a href='https://css-tricks.com/scooped-corners-in-2018/' rel='nofollow'>how to do it</a>. (<a href='https://css-tricks.com/scooped-corners-in-2018/' rel='nofollow'>Image credit</a>)<h4>JavaScript</h4><ul><li><a href='https://webkit.org/blog/8170/clipboard-api-improvements/' rel='nofollow'>WebKit got an upgrade for the Clipboard API</a>, and the team gives some very interesting insights into how it works and how Safari will handle some of the common challenges with clipboard data (e.g. images).</li><li>If you work with key value stores that live only in the frontend, <a href='https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval' rel='nofollow'>IDB-Keyval</a> is a great lightweight library that simplifies working with IndexedDB and localStorage.</li><li>Ever wanted to create graphics from your data with a hand-drawn, sketchy look on a website? <a href='http://roughjs.com/' rel='nofollow'>Rough.js</a> lets you do just that. It’s usually Canvas-based (for better performance and less data) but can also draw SVG paths.</li><li>If you need a drag-and-drop reorder module, there’s a smooth and accessible solution available now: <a href='https://github.com/schne324/dragon-drop' rel='nofollow'>dragon-drop</a>.</li><li>For many years, we could only get CSS values in their computed value and even that wasn’t flexible or nice to work with. But now CSS has a proper object-based API for working with values in JavaScript: the <a href='https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/cssom' rel='nofollow'>CSS Typed Object Model</a>. It’s only available in the upcoming Chrome 66 yet but definitely a promising feature I’d love to use in my code soon.</li><li>The React.js documentation now has an extra section that explains how to easily and <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#programmatically-managing-focus' rel='nofollow'>programmatically manage focus states to ensure your UI is accessible</a>.</li><li>James Milner shares how we can <a href='https://www.loxodrome.io/post/cancelling-requests/' rel='nofollow'>use abortable fetch to cancel requests</a>.</li><li>There are a few articles about Web Push Notifications out there already, but Oleksii Rudenko’s <a href='https://60devs.com/getting-started-with-web-push-notifications.html' rel='nofollow'>getting-started guide</a> is a great primer that explains the principles very well.</li><li>In the past years, we got a lot of new features on the JavaScript platform. And since it’s hard to remember all the new stuff, Raja Rao DV summed up <a href='https://medium.freecodecamp.org/here-are-examples-of-everything-new-in-ecmascript-2016-2017-and-2018-d52fa3b5a70e' rel='nofollow'>“Everything new in ECMAScript 2016, 2017, and 2018”</a>.</li></ul><h4>Work &amp; Life</h4><ul><li>To raise awareness for how common such situations are for all of us, James Bennett shares an embarrassing situation <a href='https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2018/mar/20/mistakes/' rel='nofollow'>where he made a simple mistake that took him a long time to find out</a>. It’s not just me making mistakes, it’s not just you, and not just James — all of us make mistakes, and as embarrassing as they seem to be in that particular situation, there’s nothing to feel bad about.</li><li>Adam Blanchard says “<a href='http://adamblanchard.co.uk/blog/2016/people-are-machines/' rel='nofollow'>People are machines. We need maintenance, too.</a>” and creates a comparison for engineers to understand why we need to take care of ourselves and also why we need people who take care of us. This is an insight into what People Engineers do, and why it’s so important for companies to hire such people to ensure a team is healthy.</li><li>If there’s one thing we don’t talk much about in the web industry, it’s retirement. Jan Chipchase now wrote <a href='https://medium.com/studio-d/on-retirement-c4200ad6a9b2' rel='nofollow'>a lot of interesting thoughts all about retirement</a>.</li><li>Rebecca Downes shares some <a href='https://medium.com/@beccadownes/remote-teams-45038339ac68' rel='nofollow'>insights into her PhD on remote teams</a>, revealing under which circumstances remote teams are great and under which they’re not.</li></ul><a href='http://adamblanchard.co.uk/blog/2016/people-are-machines/' rel='nofollow'></a>People need maintenance, too. That’s where the <a href='http://adamblanchard.co.uk/blog/2016/people-are-machines/' rel='nofollow'>People Engineer</a> comes in. (<a href='http://adamblanchard.co.uk/blog/2016/people-are-machines/' rel='nofollow'>Image credit</a>)<h4>Going Beyond…</h4><ul><li>Now that we discuss the problems of centralized services like Facebook and Google, decentralization is seen as the savior of the independent web. But I’m sure that <a href='https://medium.com/@helloanselm/decentralized-wont-fix-unethical-behavior-5d20847cc608' rel='nofollow'>if we don’t try to solve the underlying humanitarian issue with technology, nothing will change</a>.</li><li>You might have read the news about the first fatal crash with a self-driving car. A sad milestone that shows <a href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/22/self-driving-car-uber-death-woman-failure-fatal-crash-arizona' rel='nofollow'>how unreliable this technology can be</a> and how far away we still are from being able to rely on such systems.</li><li>A decade ago, smart devices promised to change the way we think and interact, and they have – but not by making us smarter. Eric Andrew-Gee explores the scientific <a href='https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/your-smartphone-is-making-you-stupid/article37511900/' rel='nofollow'>evidence that digital distraction is damaging our minds</a>.</li><li>Fred Pearce wrote about <a href='https://e360.yale.edu/features/energy-hogs-can-huge-data-centers-be-made-more-efficient' rel='nofollow'>how we can make the world’s largest data centers more efficient</a>. If you wonder why this would be the desired goal, it’s important to know that these data centers are responsible for 3% of the overall global CO2 emissions — as much as the airline industry.</li><li>“<a href='https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/11/coal-power-plant-reopened-cryptocurrency-miners/' rel='nofollow'>A disused coal power station will reopen to solely power crypto</a> currencies.” I have no additional words for this.</li></ul><p>We hope you enjoyed this Web Development Update.

We’re here to change that, and we need your help.</p><p>We started out in 2010 with an email subscription form, a YouTube account, and a lot of scrambling to figure things out. Even with over 40,000 clients in 80 countries, pretty much everything about how we’ve built our company and marketed our products has been bootstrapped by a small group of deeply invested people wearing a lot of hats and learning as we went along. Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</p><p>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and <strong>we are looking for a Front-End WP Developer to join GMB, part-time to start</strong>. You’ll be part of a team that is helping to imagine and build new products — as well as improve existing ones.</p><h2>What will be your responsibilities?</h2><ul><li>Working directly with our graphic designer to bring new design to code</li><li>Update and improve existing front-end code</li><li>Potential to work on the next version of our app and be involved in styleguide and UI library creation</li></ul><h3>To do this job, you will need:</h3><ul><li>Experience bringing WordPress themes to code (HTML/CSS/JS)</li><li>Some sense or experience in UX design</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end tools (Gulp, Sass, etc.)</li><li>Experience using git and GitHub workflows</li><li>Familiarity with CSS methodology (SMACSS, BEM, etc.)</li><li>Bonus points for some back-end and API familiarity especially with regard to WordPress</li></ul><h3>Other Requirements &amp; Competencies</h3><ul><li>You’ve been following GMB for a while and understand what sets us apart from other fitness companies.</li><li>You are clear on the value you’ll bring to the team.</li><li>You know how to follow instructions and how to be creative – and how to choose between them.</li><li>You speak and read/write perfect English.</li><li>You have a sense of humor.</li><li>You always work to develop a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>.</li><li>You are good at self-managing.</li><li>You have a strong DIY ethic – know what you don’t know and what you can do about it.</li><li>You can make things happen.

We’re working to make the world a better place by teaching people to take control of what their bodies can do so they can contribute to their families and communities. We create options for exploration and self-expression.</p><p>And we work the way we practice.

We deliver products, solutions and platforms built using blockchain technology to transform how business is done in complex network of buyers, suppliers and consumers.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, the music industry, security, and infrastructure, and more. To accomplish this we've built out a flat organizational structure which we call the ConsenSys Mesh: a network of individuals &amp; teams working autonomously and towards the same goal.  Our mission is to use these decentralized solutions to fundamentally reshape the economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us.</p><p>About the role:<br>We are currently seeking a Design System Lead with a passion for the designer and developer experiences in the Ethereum ecosystem. Realizing a decentralized future depends on the mass adoption and use of applications built on Ethereum, so we are focused on making the experience of building an application as easy as possible—with the highest quality results.</p><p>Teams, internally and eventually externally, need a way to quickly prototype decentralized applications (dApps) and validate their ideas. As product designers across the organization learn and experiment, we need a way to aggregate best practices around interactions specific to blockchain. The Design System Lead will drive the vision and grow a team to research, build, and iterate upon a design system to serve internal teams and, in the future, the broader Ethereum community.</p><p>As the Design System Lead is responsible for the visual and technical direction of the Design System, this will require both product and project management skills, in addition to a deep understanding of design and front-end development. The ideal candidate will design a complete systems life-cycle, from establishing a practice and vision that endures to design, build, document, and maintain a library used by many product teams.</p><p>Responsibilities:<br>Lead: Lead the visual and technical direction of the experience design, visual style, and technical tooling, with input from peers from product design and development teams.<br>Build a team: Plan for and grow a design system team of front-end developers and designers. Identify and nurture team growth and culture, identifying opportunities for team members to drive and lead system aspects.<br>Research: Identify strategic teams/groups for design system consumption and align research activity to assess efficacy of system concerns. Anticipate edge cases and support recommendations with solid research and end-user testing.<br>Measure: Verify and improve on designs contributed to the design system through reviews, usability testing, and alignment to established patterns and standards.<br>Identify, monitor, and report on system use across the company and community.<br>Evangelize: Present the system’s mission, library, and process to internal and external groups. Fearlessly take on highly complex problem areas and publish what you learn.<br>Manage: Facilitate regular team scrum and sprint planning sessions. Clarify scope to balance delivering minimum useful functionality with properly scalable system design. Deliver system releases at a predictable cadence.</p><p>Requirements:<br>You have led, built, and/or maintained a design system, evidenced in an online portfolio<br>You are passionate about accessibility and localization<br>Previous experience working with UI frameworks like Angular, React, VUE, Ember, etc.<br>Experience working with remote designers and engineers<br>You demonstrate product vision and use data and experimentation to provide product direction.<br>You understand customer experience and the relationship between brand and product design<br>You’re excellent at articulating design decisions, presenting to clients or stakeholders<br>You’re effective at prototyping at varying levels of fidelity<br>You demonstrate solid leadership skills and an ability to develop strong partnerships<br>Agile, adaptable, and capable of iteration and collaboration across many disciplines</p><p>Even better if:<br>You’re interested in or have experience with decentralized applications and blockchain<br>You’re interested in or have experience designing for platforms, working within an open source community or project, and/or developer tools<br>You enjoy some amount of ambiguity and freedom to experiment<br>You have front-end development experience<br>You enjoy writing and public speaking to share your ideas</p></div>",

    "content": "Bikmo is an adventure sports technology company, with a simple mission to provide exceptional services that enable our customers to spend more time exploring the great outdoors.<br /><br />Focussing initially on insurance in the cycling sector, we're now live in the UK, Ireland, Germany and Austria and by utilising sector expertise, technology, a love for the sport and an open approach to data, we've won customers, partners, awards and 5-star reviews.<br /><br />We are searching for a technically excellent and self-starting full stack developer to join our CTO in developing the platform that will enable us to achieve this ambition. Rapid application development allows us to adapt to our customers' needs and stay one step ahead of the competition, so we're looking for an applicant with an agile and adaptive mind.<br /><br />Our ideal candidate would be one who has as much energy for adventure sports as they do coding - you can live and work in the heart of the Alps, the UK or where you choose.<br /><br />The role:<br /><br />You will be working on a number of existing applications, and aiding with the creation of new application as and when they are needed. Our applications use middleware stacks to allow efficient re-use of encapsulated code, and the rapid development and deployment of new systems and feature sets. As a startup, we are moving at a rapid pace and the successful candidate will need to be able to get up to speed quickly and work self-sufficiently.<br /><br />In our back-end work we follow PHP-fig standards where they apply. We check our code for 'mess' and standards before sharing with remote repos and other projects. We use the git-flow branching strategy, and code review via pull-request.<br /><br />In our front-end work we build templates in Twig which can be integrated into existing and new PHP server-side projects. Developers need to have a good understanding of how data can be provided from and delivered to the back-end application, through template rendering, form submission and API interaction. They need to be able to use composition and inheritance to implement an effective, efficient templating strategy.<br /><br />Valuable experience of using JS, and JQuery where appropriate, is essential to any of our front-end work. The developer should be able to manipulate the DOM to provide an exceptional user experience, and use application logic to interact with the back end application on-page.<br /><br />Benefits:<br /><br />This role is a full time role at 38 hours per week, Monday to Friday.<br /><br />The Bikmo HQ is based in Chester, but you do not need to be. Everyone in the Bikmo team works remotely to some degree. We also have offices in Innsbruck and Munich which you are welcome to work in.<br /><br />It will be highly beneficial to spend the initial phase of your employment sitting side-by-side with our CTO Jorj, in order to get to grips with our existing systems, our roadmap, and our working expectations. This can either be done at one of our offices, or, potentially, at your work environment if it's more practical for Jorj to spend time there instead.<br /><br />As a growing business, our benefit structure is under review and will include a share options scheme and holiday entitlement boost.<br /><br />Holiday is pro rata at 28 days per year, inclusive of bank holidays. You get an additional day of leave for your birthday and may take 1 day per month for riding adventures / 12 days per year - in return for content for our magazine.<br /><br />Your application:<br /><br />Please include a bit about you/your CV of LinkedIn profile and answers to the following questions with your application;<br /><br />1. Talk about your preferred development environment: computer, software, and office.<br />2. What did you learn this week?<br />3. What is at the top of your riding (cycling, snowboarding, etc.) bucket-list?",

But we’re even prouder of the fact that we’re a platform that serves developers, and we’re helping them build their own complex business process applications that require extensive forms and APIs to support them. No other platform provides developers the tools that we provide them.</p><p>We are growing rapidly, and have more work and opportunities than we have people to accomplish them. That’s where you come in!</p><p>If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have extensive experience with Javascript on *both* the front end and the back end. You’re excited about all the new technologies coming down the pike like typescript, angular 5, vue, ES2018 and are a super quick study. This isn’t your first rodeo. You’ve got 5 or more years of experience, and can point to multiple apps or sites you have helped ship.</p><p>That’s a really quick intro of what we are looking for but first you need to know what it is like working for us.</p><h5>A little about us</h5><p>We’re an early-stage company that provides our customers a powerful and unique combined Form and API platform designed specifically for developers!We have something that no-one else has, and we’ve achieved significant traction in the market and adoption byenterprises all over the world, ranging from startups, SMBs, to large enterprises, who operate in a wide range of business verticals including healthcare, education, government agencies, insurance, banking and financial services, legal, online retail, industrial, compliance, agricultural, software agencies, and many others. We are fully funded, have been cash flow positive for a while, and are rapidly growing our MRR revenue without needing to search for new investment capital.</p><p>We love building tools that make data collection and management easier for developers building web apps. As part of that we’ve developed tons of front end and back end components and tools in many frameworks and technologies.</p><h5>Who you’d be working with</h5><p>Our team is is small, tightly knit, and highly collaborative group of contributors. We are headquartered in Dallas, TX, but we have several remote developers as well, and we work very well over remote by utilizing conference and chatroom tools.</p><p><strong>Travis</strong> - the founding father and CTO of Form.io leads the team with technology insight and vision, combined with the powerful ability to roll up his sleeves and dive deep into the code with any issue. Travis is known within the company, and by our customers, for solving insanely complex problems over a weekend that would take a normal developer a month. Travis has a strong presence and following in the developer community, and much of his work can be found on Github and YouTube. Travis spends his free time with his wife and kids.</p><p><strong>Randall</strong> - our Lead Architect and sometimes described as “The most interesting developer in the world” due to his extensive worldwide traveling, and his tendency to tell crazy stories. . When not doing home improvement work on his house, or going to his daughters’ ballet classes, he’s resolving conflicting bug fixes and designing our next generation platform. If you have a problem, Randall can solve it, just don't get him started telling a story or you'll never get away.</p><p>And the rest of our extremely talented team including Gary Denise , Angel, Jeriah, Robert, Edwin, Rakesh, Yury and Alena.</p><h5>How you’ll work at Form.io</h5><p>We’re a group of dedicated and talented people - the kind you’d be excited to work with. Here’s what that looks like.</p><p><strong>Live where you want</strong> - We’re mostly located in the Dallas area but we do have very productive members of our team elsewhere. We all work from home a portion of the time, so we’re very good at using tools that enable remote work. Due to market demands and activities, and time zone overlaps we're currently looking specifically for new team members in the US and also in Australia, (but of course we’re also open to attracting exceptional talent from other regions too!)</p><p><strong>No crazy hours</strong> - We’re a startup but we realize that overworking our developers doesn’t make the process faster or better. We’re more interested in you developing great code and solving problems than working crazy hours.</p><p><strong>We’re all adults</strong> - There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor. We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit in front of a computer.</p><p><strong>World class tools</strong> - We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer (probably a mac) and replace it every three years.</p><p><strong>Solve important problems</strong> - We’re constantly doing hard things that are fun and helping companies work. We spend a lot of time designing new systems and solutioning problems for our customers.</p><p><strong>Learn new things</strong> - We’re built on latest generation technology and are always on the lookout for what’s new. Be prepared to constantly be learning promising new technologies and figuring out how they can make our company better.</p><p><strong>Testing is not a dirty word</strong> - We believe in automated testing. Bug fixes as well as new features should come with automated tests to ensure they work and make sure they don’t break in the future.</p><h5>Now, back to you, our new Javascript Developer…</h5><p>You’re a javascript developer with over 5 years of experience. You’ve done work with both the frontend (angular, react, vue, etc) and the backend (nodejs). You understand what makes javascript javascript with concepts like asynchronous functions, promises, scoping and prototypical inheritance. You also stay on top of the latest ES6 features like classes, arrow functions, destructuring and typescript. You know how to write east-to-maintain code, documentation while getting things done under pressure.</p><p>You’ll help us continue building out our platform, client apps and develop new functionality. There are always a ton of new client requests coming in as well as helping them set up their projects and learn how to build with our tools. In addition, there are the new features and functionality. We have a roadmap full of exciting new features such as form workflow, payment gateways, 3rd party platform integrations, and new framework support.</p><p>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer who doesn’t write only so that the computer can understand your code, but also so other developers can understand it too.</li><li>Are a fast learner of new technologies and keep on top of new trends.</li><li>Are a top notch debugger. You can find problems quickly and understand how to fix them without breaking other functionality.</li><li>Are self motivated and take responsibility for fixing problems like:<ul><li>“The form is too slow if you configure it like …”</li><li>&quot;Add paypal integration to this app”</li><li>&quot;We need to allow international versions of the phone field”</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple frameworks with different technologies.</li><li>Have experience with<ul><li>React/Vue/Angular/AngularJS</li><li>Nodejs/Express</li><li>Mongodb</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES2015/Typescript</li></ul></li><li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one app in one of the above frameworks.</li><li>Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li><li><strong>Bonus</strong> - You already use form.io!</li></ul><p><em>Form.io is an equal opportunity employer. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to build and expand a smart, hard-working team that loves working together to build something exciting and relevant.</em></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

Founded in 2011, Traitify has developed a patented methodology by which unique personality profiles are created by users choosing “Me” or “Not Me” when presented with a series of images. Backed by a team of psychologists, we're providing personality based insights to Fortune 100 companies about their customers and employees. Traitify makes personality data accessible to companies looking to better understand their users in order to deliver more personalized recommendations and content.</p><h5>Who You'll Be Working With</h5><p>We're a small team of talented software developers, with a diverse background in various industries and technology stacks. We value individual contributions to team success, and it's through collaboration and these contributions that we create the reliable and performant code that makes Traitify a great place to work. We work remotely and stay in contact primarily through Slack, but also have a daily standup with the whole technology team via Google Hangouts. We understand the value of uninterrupted time, so often we're heads down writing code or researching new technologies or solutions. Speaking of new technologies, we value experimentation to solve new problems, or to improve existing solutions. Here's a few examples:</p><ul><li>Experiment with new languages and platforms to determine direction for future microservices, one of which we're now using in production as a result of this effort.</li><li>Replaced front end of our SAAS product with a React front end</li><li>Rewrote our JS widget library to use Preact framework to reduce code</li></ul><p>We strive to write well-tested and clean code. We perform peer code reviews via Github to help catch defects and learn from one another.</p><p>We also try and get together in person a few times a year, to have face time with each other and the rest of the stellar employees at Traitify.</p><h5>What You'll Be Doing</h5><p>As a Full Stack Engineer, you'll be helping to develop new features in many of our products, primarliy our SAAS product. You'll be helping troubleshoot customer issues, as well as working with teams developing internal tools and products here at Traitify. A typical day can include fixing a defect, writing a new component for our SAAS app, reviewing a pull request or working on an internal tool to help our psychology team. We're growing fast, so a few things in our future include:</p><ul><li>Migrating our existing SAAS app to more of a single page app model.</li><li>Building out new microservices.</li><li>Discovering and building ways to interpret our personality data and turn them into actionable insights for our customers.</li></ul><h5>What We Expect From You</h5><ul><li>Strong experience in writing production quality code in a dynamically-typed scripting language (Ruby, Javascript, Elixir, etc).

    "content": "Join a small JavaScript development team within a successful business about to embark on its next phase of growth.<br /><br />* Working on a varied 3 year roadmap for in-house products, including FLG (sales lead management) and Flow XO (chatbots and messaging).<br />* Our team is focused on JavaScript across the full stack. This role is for a front-end focused developer, with an eye for design and great user experience.<br />* Be part of a small team where the part you play is noticed and rewarded.<br /><br />*Who We Are*<br /><br />We're a B2B (SaaS) technology business established just over 10 years ago. Since then, our growth has been steady and organic, and we've built a great business with several £million in annual revenue and very healthy profits.<br /><br />A few years ago we launched Flow XO, a business messaging and chatbots product. Flow XO is already a leader in its market with users all over the world.<br /><br />*Our Plan For Growth*<br /><br />We're now working on a 3 year plan to accelerate our growth and bring the FLG and Flow XO products closer together.<br /><br />The foundations are there - strong history, good revenues, excellent profits, amazing people in both the team and customers.<br /><br />Our plans include a new focus on sales and marketing, and a revamped approach to product, which will see FLG and Flow XO become an expanded product family and see new products brought into the mix.<br /><br />*The Role*<br /><br />You'll be working on our user interfaces. We use mainly Angular and React, with a little Vue in there as well. Although purely front-end focused, this is a development rather than a designer role. However, design is still important to the job and should be something you feel just as comfortable with.<br /><br />Typical tasks may involve taking a low-res wireframe and turning it into beautifully coded HTML, creating React components for elements of our UI such as drop-down selectors or popup menus, or even working on layout ideas for an entirely new product.<br /><br />Our product roadmap means there is likely to be whole new products being actively worked on every 3-6 months, at least for the next few years.<br /><br />*Is This You?*<br /><br />* An eye for design and layout<br />* You understand what makes a good user interface<br />* Appreciate and can create good quality, efficient, maintainable markup<br />* Have at least mid-level JavaScript skills<br />* Preferably have worked with the frameworks we already use (Angular/React)<br />* You're engaging, approachable and pragmatic<br />* You are great at written communication<br /><br />If this is you, please come and join our team. Our customers need you.<br /><br />*The Rewards*<br /><br />This is a rare opportunity to transform something great into something incredible.<br /><br />A chance to plot the businesses growth and point proudly to when you joined the business, just before the curve takes that sharp upwards turn.<br /><br />As well as a rewarding challenge, we also offer:<br /><br />* A very competitive salary<br />* Flexible working hours<br />* Part-time remote working available<br /><br />Our product team is based in Manchester City Centre. We don't care about your gender, race, sexuality, age, whether you have disabilities we need to accommodate, etc. - we're simply looking for someone that can deliver.<br /><br />*Next Steps*<br /><br />The first step is to send us your current CV and write us an intro. The intro is important, you need to explain (succinctly) how you fit into the picture.<br /><br />We're looking forward to hearing from you!",

We tend to hear about studies and their findings, but we don’t hear how researchers recruit study participants. Let’s resolve this mystery.                            </p>    </div>    <div>        <h6>Table of Contents</h6>        <div></div>    </div></div>        <div>  <div>    <div>      <a rel='nofollow'></a>    </div>      <div>      <h3>Members support Smashing</h3>    </div>  </div>  <p><em>Wonderful</em>, friendly people who keep this lil' site alive — and <strong>get smarter</strong> every&nbsp;day.</p>  <a rel='nofollow'>Are you smashing, too?&nbsp;→</a></div>                   </div>            <div>                <div>    </div>                <p>For UX designers and design teams, research with stakeholders and users is critical. However, accessing research participants isn’t as easy as it sounds. For both professional and amateur researchers finding people to participate in studies can be an elusive task. We often hear about studies and their findings, but we don’t hear as often how researchers recruit study participants.</p><p>Researchers can choose from a variety ways to find participants. Many factors determine the best method to use. This includes resources such as time and money, the research method you’re using, the type or characteristics of participants you want to recruit, and the accessibility of these types of participants. In this post, I’ll remove some of the mystery and provide guidance to those interested in recruiting participants for qualitative UX studies.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1ab7156e-b4b5-44c8-9436-9ea8b0fb9546/finding-research-participants-g-recruiting.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        Potential research participants are everywhere, if you know what to look for.            <h4>Incentives</h4><p>You can use incentives to increase the likelihood of participation in any of these methods of recruitment. Use of incentives is usually a personal choice. Do you feel incentivized participants provide skewed or biased data? I don’t have any issues with providing incentives. An incentive can be a small token of appreciation ($5 gift card) or something more substantial ($200 or more depending on time needed and type of participant.</p><p>I’ve provided guidance for each method based on my experience with incentives.</p>      <div>      <div>        <p>          Is your pattern library up to date today? <em>Alla Kholmatova</em> has just finished a fully fledged book on <strong>Design Systems</strong> and how to get them right.

Particularly at the beginning of a project. This is a great opportunity to understand everyone’s role, what their vision and hopes are for a project or product, and how you might incorporate their experience into the rest of the project. You can increase buy-in and make people feel like part of the process by including stakeholder interviews in any project. I use the term internal stakeholder broadly to describe individuals who have a vested interest in a product or project who are connected to your organization or the product in some way. Many of these internal stakeholders might also be users of the product you are interviewing them about.</p><h5>When To Use It</h5><p>You can always look for opportunities to interview stakeholders and colleagues to learn more. This is especially useful at the beginning of a project. You can learn expectations for a product, background information on what led to the current status of the project, and goals and hopes for the future. Checking in with stakeholders throughout a project will keep them aware of how things are progressing and allow you to get their feedback. I’ve found this is helpful for building trust with stakeholders and making them feel included in the process.</p><h5>How You Might Do It</h5><p>You can often arrange interviews with key stakeholders yourself if they are internal to your company. You’ll identify who is relevant to your project, including project team members, and invite them to an interview. You can contact them to schedule a time, or look to schedule using your company’s shared calendar platform (e.g., Outlook or G Suite). You should know ahead of time how long you need to schedule and how you will interview the participant (in-person or remote) so you can share this information with them at scheduling.</p><p>Identifying and interviewing stakeholders becomes more complicated when you don’t have direct access to scheduling yourself. If your project team is part of a larger organization, you might need to ask colleagues in other departments to help identify and schedule stakeholders. If you are on a project team with outside partners or have external stakeholders, you will often need someone to facilitate identification and scheduling of interviews. I’ll cover some additional challenges for recruiting stakeholders and others through your clients in the identifying participants through a client section.</p><h5>Positive Aspects</h5><p>Gain insight into roles, backgrounds, and history of stakeholders’ involvement with a product or issue, potentially quick to schedule, low to no cost outside of time, can be done remote or in-person, talking to customer/user-facing stakeholders might provide some insight into what users think of a product.</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>Difficult to identify everyone you want to participate, might include people at high-levels who are hard to reach, scheduling if not doing it yourself, scaling down if resources are limited, does not replace research with users, many stakeholders are too close to their product to be objective.</p><h5>Incentives</h5><p>I typically don’t provide an incentive if internal stakeholders are participating during work hours.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I worked on a project with a bank that wanted to design an online onboarding experience for new customers. We needed to understand what the current (non-digital) onboarding experience was. We wanted to document available resources to pull into the onboarding experience. Lastly, we needed to build trust with partners who we were going to rely on to champion the experience we created.</p><p>We relied on word of mouth to learn who we needed to speak with. First, we interviewed the people we were closest to and asked them who else they considered necessary for us to speak with. We spoke with people in numerous US states, both remotely and in-person. We were able to speak with 30 people in three weeks (this was not a project we were dedicating full time). Occasionally, we spoke to people who were not relevant to our specific purpose. There were two key reasons we were given names of some folks who weren’t relevant:</p><ul><li>They were higher up executives with little knowledge of what we were exploring</li><li>The people referring them didn’t understand/effectively convey what we were trying to accomplish, so they volunteered to participate in something not aligned with their role</li></ul><p>We found our most common difficulties were in scheduling and getting people to reply to our initial emails. We were trying to schedule an hour to speak with people who spend most of their days traveling and in meetings. Many of them had personal assistants managing their calendars. Some didn’t have an opening to speak with us for weeks after our initial request. Most people did want to make the time to speak with us. They viewed our project as one with high strategic importance in the long-term health of their company. We also had many people reschedule due to unforeseen conflicts involving client needs arising.</p><p>We were able to paint a clearer picture of the bank’s onboarding experience and what resources were available. We were able to understand what (some) of the leadership viewed as the potential future for an onboarding experience with new customers and what their perceptions of shortcomings were for the current onboarding experience. We were able to identify gaps in knowledge that required additional future research and education. We made connections with critical internal advocates who walked away with a better understanding and appreciation of the experience we were creating. We would not have been able to achieve these outcomes through a survey or through other means of recruiting participants. Later, we were able to approach these same stakeholders to have them provide feedback on the designs for the onboarding experience we created.</p><h4>Identifying Participants Through A Client</h4><p>Many potential research participants are unavailable to the general public. You will find situations where you don’t have direct access to recruiting relevant participants. This is particularly true if you work for a design consultancy/studio, or as part of a shared services team within a large organization. For example, if your client is a widget manufacturer and their product is a widget warehouse product supply application, you will need to access their staff in order to understand their current pain points and needs. You won’t have an easy time finding relevant participants using the population you have access to. You want to conduct research and usability testing with participants who will become the end user of the application, which again means you’d need to access this population through your client.</p>  <div></div><h5>When To Use It</h5><p>In addition to the reasons given in the previous section for recruiting stakeholders, when you have to reach specific populations, need opinions from specific people, and want to make your client-stakeholders feel like part of the process. When you don’t have direct insight or access to critical research participants when you are looking to build relationships beyond the project team you are working with, when you want to include a diverse set of individuals covering relevant areas of the product you’re working on.</p><h5>How To Do It</h5><p>Work closely with your client or person you are collaborating with to identify the right people for the project you are on. Your project will dictate the exact specifications of roles you need. This includes Product Owners, VPs, Business Analysts, and Users. I often provide a script or email language for my clients to use for recruiting participants. I explain the purpose of the research, how you were made aware of the participant (e.g., Jane from accounting gave me your information) how long the conversation is expected to take, potential dates of availability, incentive (if any), prep work required (if any).</p><p>You should provide your client with a screener clearly stating:</p><ul><li>How many of each type of participant you want to participate</li><li>Details you want to know ahead of time (e.g., years using the product, industry)</li><li>Factors leading to disqualification from the study (e.g., less than one year of experience with the product)</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus</strong>: Many organizations keep data on their users. Your client might be able to screen their database and provide you research participants. However, when I’ve used this in the past, there are often many permissions required and processes to gain access to customers. This can add a significant amount of time to your project.</p><p>I am always clear to my clients that scheduling participants is one of the largest hurdles to a project’s timeline. Working with others’ schedules is complicated. You should make it clear to your clients how to recruit, and the need to start recruiting as soon as possible.</p><h5>Positive Aspects</h5><p>You get specific people close to a project or product, you learn about long-term and short-term goals directly from the people you work with, you are able to ask to follow up questions that might inform projects well beyond your current relationship, you learn the history of the product or organization, you can reach relevant people you don’t have direct access to, you gain insight into roles, backgrounds, and history of stakeholders’ and users’ involvement with an issue, you will find talking directly to the users of the product provides context and texture you wouldn’t find from someone without similar knowledge.</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>This can be time-consuming, requires a clear communication of purpose, you might end up talking to people less relevant if your client doesn’t screen effectively, less control over scheduling, lack of control over how information is shared with participants.</p><p>Incentives – I typically don’t provide an incentive if they are from the client and participating during work hours. I’d provide an incentive if they have recruited users who are coming in on an off day or outside of work hours. You might also have a larger incentive but only give it to a couple randomly selected participants.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I worked for a team looking at redesigning a digital report for a large mortgage lender. Many other banks and loan providers do business under the umbrella of this company. We needed to identify a specific type of user, one who: worked for a bank under the parent company and used the report as part of their daily tasks.</p><p>The client wanted us to interview 30 individuals with roles interacting with the report. They identified a handful of these individuals upfront, and then put out a call for participation to identify the remaining individuals. There were numerous layers of communication through relationship managers as well as permissions and disclosures the client needed to handle with each participant.</p><p>We were able to complete over 30 remote (over the phone) interviews in the month we were allotted to collect data. Our client arranged and scheduled each interview. Our most common difficulties were similar to those I gave in the previous case study, scheduling and relevancy of participants.  We were interviewing people who spend their entire workday running the report and using the data to inform their decisions; busy people with limited flexibility of daytime work hours. We made ourselves available at any time a participant had availability in order to solve this. This created drawbacks in scheduling other meetings unrelated to working on the project.</p><p>Some of our participants forwarded the invitation to others they thought should be on the interview as well. We would find this out when more than one person would join the call. We were initially caught off guard when we had a call intended for one person take place with four participants at once. We created a separate multi-participant protocol to account for this occurring on future calls, which it did. I recommend expecting this to happen regardless of who is recruiting your participants. It’s difficult to control what happens, once you send out an invitation to the wild.</p><p>We used data from our interviews to understand the current behaviors, frustrations, and needs of users. We also presented later participants with sample designs in order to get feedback on report layout and feature changes. We delivered a redesigned report that exceeded client expectations and became a reference piece in their quest to get further funding for research and design projects.</p><h4>Paying A Recruitment Firm (When You Have An Accessible Population)</h4><p>Recruitment firms offer services ranging from participant screening and recruitment, facilities to conduct research, recording your sessions, and much more. You can use a recruitment firm when you are conducting research with populations you believe you can reach through contact with the general public. For example, if you are conducting usability testing on an online banking application. You can expect most people familiar with banking transactions (e.g., making a deposit or bill pay) should successfully use your application. Even if they don’t currently use your bank.</p><p>I’ve used a number of firms over the past few years. Most of them offer similar services.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/baef2b30-1589-40e7-a2c0-741f54df2813/finding-research-participants-recruiter.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        Recruitment firms often provide facilities for interviews or usability testing.            <h5>When To Use It</h5><p>When you don’t have direct access to potential participants when you want to have a third party screen your participants, when your sample is available through the general public, when you want to have someone handle recruitment, scheduling, and day-of-research preparation.</p><h5>How To Do It</h5><p>You will need to create the screener the recruiter will use. You decide in advance how many of each type of participant you will want. You’ll want to include a number of “floaters” in your recruitment as well. Floaters are people who meet the requirements of the study and are willing to show up for participation in case some of the other participants don’t show up. Floaters are typically compensated at higher levels because they are committing to spend two or three hours sitting around in case they are needed.</p><p>You’ll also need to provide the screener with enough advance notice as the recruiter requires. I’ve found this is two weeks in advance for most studies, and three weeks in advance for more complex studies. All recruitment firms offer participants an incentive, usually cash, to participate in a study. You will have to be ok with the fact your participants are receiving money to participate. I haven’t found this to be problematic, but you should be prepared to defend why you don’t think this will add any additional bias to your data.</p><h5>Positive Aspects</h5><p>Very detailed screening, don’t have to find people, often have a facility you can use, will record audio and video as needed, will recruit additional participants in case some don’t show up.</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>Cost, the time needed in advance if you have a difficult to reach population, participants trying to game the system.</p><p>Incentives – Recruitment firms almost always compensate the people they recruit. You will pay the recruitment firm a set fee they pay to participants.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I worked for a team wanting to define the digital needs and behaviors of specific types of Financial Advisors. The client did not want to expose their brand during any of the research, so they did not want to facilitate the recruitment. The client wanted the interviews to pull participants from more than one major city in the US. We worked with a recruitment firm to identify and recruit participants, as well as to conduct the interview sessions.</p><p>We worked with the client to create a detailed screener with items meant to refine the population to the specific participants we wanted for the study. The recruitment firm asked for three weeks to find 15 participants for the first city in our study. The usual turn around when working with the firm was two weeks with less specialized participants. We were also advised to provide a higher incentive, over double what we typically offered, due to the probability we were asking participants to step away from work and the perceived value of their time.</p><p>We were able to interview 15 participants over the course of two days. We found a few of the participants didn’t actually meet the qualifications we’d screened for. They had manipulated their responses to qualify. Our client was unhappy with this. We were able to use the floaters to replace the participants who didn’t truly qualify. We were also able to get a refund on what we’d paid to recruit the unqualified participants.</p><p>Ultimately, we reached our goal of interviewing the right number of participants in the right amount of time, and produced a report on needs and behaviors for our client.</p><p>We would not have been able to access this population without the use of the recruitment firm. The client was unwilling to expose their brand and therefore unwilling to identify participants from their contact list. We would have spent more time and money than the project allowed if we were left to recruit participants. We don’t have contact lists or the ability to easily identify specialized populations through our own resources. We still experienced frustration with the lack of initial quality participants the recruitment firm provided. In general, we’ve had positive experiences with recruitment firms, but the more specialized the population, the more likely you will find some duds.</p><h4>Guerilla Recruiting (When You Want To Find People In The Wild)</h4><p>You can utilize public spaces to recruit potential study participants. Guerilla research is a term for quick and dirty research conducted with people as they go about their daily tasks (in the wild so to speak). The term is meant to reflect a context in which you are pressed for resources. However, you can benefit from using this method of recruiting even when you have resources for other methods. Sometimes collecting data from people when they are in specific settings is the most appropriate method.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3c7fc127-bdbd-4139-9fa6-20375696f603/finding-research-participants-clipboard.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        You can find plenty of potential users in the wild.            <p>You should determine a space you want to recruit participants for a logical reason. Let’s say you’re designing a smartphone application meant to help people track their workouts at the gym. You would want to recruit participants from that setting, entering or exiting the gym. If you wanted to test out a new form of electronic payment, you’d want to be present in a setting where transactions take place.</p><h5>When To Use It</h5><p>When you have little time or budget, when you have access to relevant populations, when you only want to get quick feedback from a few people, when you can spend 20 minutes or less per participant, when you have a product related to a specific physical space (e.g., an art museum tour application).</p><h5>How To Do It</h5><p>Find a location, get permission if needed, create a script. I’ve previously written a <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/the-art-of-the-intercept/' rel='nofollow'>detailed article</a> on the specifics of recruiting participants in public.</p><h5>Positive Aspects</h5><p>Quick execution, the potential for multiple locations if you have the resources, small or large sample sizes, accessing relevant populations, compatible with multiple research methods.</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>Little ability for screening, approaching people takes practice and skill, potentially inclement weather if outside, a lot of standing around.</p><h5>Incentives</h5><p>I’d base the incentive on the amount of time and type of activity. For example, I might give a product discount code for something taking a minute or less. A $5 gift card if you are taking a few minutes of their time.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I worked on a project examining the use of technology in library settings. Specifically, we wanted to understand the usability of a system for finding and locating materials within the library. We wanted to work with people who use a library. We needed to test inside of the library because the last part of testing involved physically locating the material.</p><p>We sent two researchers to spend multiple days at the library while it was open for patrons. We stood with clipboards at the entrance of the library. We asked patrons if they would spend a few minutes with us participating in our study. We then observed them using the system to search for an item and asked them to locate the material based on where the system told them it should be located.</p><p>Our biggest challenge was long periods of time where there were no new patrons coming into the library. We wanted to complete 30 to 40 sessions using three different scenarios. We had budgeted to spend one week onsite to get this many responses. We had to extend our timeline for the following week to reach our goal.</p><p>We were able to suggest improvements in the interface, terminology, and an explanation of where materials were located. We would not have had similar findings if we hadn’t been on location at a library and we might not have had as valuable insights if we used people who were not library patrons.</p><h4>Friends And Family (Low On Time And Budget)</h4><p>Sometimes, you might have very little opportunity to engage in research. There are many reasons for this, time, budget, or your working for a client who refuses to allow research as part of the project plan. The designers I’ve worked with still want to have some type of feedback to shape their thinking. You can still look to gather some meaningful data from those you have closest access to. Perhaps you are on a project where you are working on a product that is relevant to your coworkers or friends you have easy access to. You might ask a few of them to participate in interviews about the product.</p><p>Friends and family are the definition of a convenience sample, and should only be used when no other options exist. This is the most biased and least rigorous way of collecting data. However, you can still benefit from insights into experiences you might otherwise not get. You can use friends and family to participate in interviews or usability testing as a means of accessing informing your design. I strongly recommend conducting additional research, using one of the other methods of finding participants, as your design progresses.</p><h5>When To Use It</h5><p>As a last resort, when you have no budget, little time, yet you want to know something about the context or users you are designing for when you have access to relevant people to participate in the study. Background information of your participants.</p><h5>How To Do It</h5><p>Reach out to others you and your team know; you can include social media to distribute the call to participate, schedule a time to speak or send an email explaining what you’re asking participants to do (you can also distribute survey links this way)Positive – you will get some feedback, almost instant, low budget</p><h5>Negative Aspects</h5><p>Most limited pool of participants, possibly less reach, you’re are relying on favors, less ability to screen for specific characteristics, introducing a larger bias due to familiarity with participants.</p><h5>Incentives</h5><p>I would incentivize based on time and budget. A $25 gift card is much less expensive than what you’d pay for a participant from a recruitment firm, but friends and family might find this amount acceptable for up to an hour of time.</p><h4>Case Study</h4><p>I was part of a project team responding to a (paid) request for proposals (RFP) from a major vacation industry company. We had two weeks to turn around our response, including design concepts to show our thinking. Most of our team had no experience in using the services from this specific industry. We needed to find out more information to help inform our response. We didn’t have the resources to undertake our typical research process of finding and interviewing stakeholders or representative end users. Instead, we reached out to friends and family members who stated they’d had experience in this vacation activity within the past three years.</p><p>We emailed our staff and asked if anyone had friends or family members with this qualification who’d be willing to engage in brief phone conversations about their experience. We conducted interviews with seven people over the course of the next two days. Our designers were able to use the insights we gained to better understand the types of needs users might have while vacationing. Our concepts attempted to address some of the issues our participants stated existed when they had experienced while vacationing.</p><p>Although we didn’t win the long-term work, our team was able to place among the top candidates. We credited the participation of friends and family in our research as part of what helped our design stand out in a positive way.

Before writing any code, the engineer tagged to the product writes a blog post announcing it to the StackShare community. From there, they spec out the product in detail and get feedback from at least one other engineer. Once the initial version of the product is built they ship it to a small group of beta testers, gather feedback, and iterate. Once the product has shipped to production, this engineer is then responsible for monitoring the metrics that matter for this product and iterating to improve it. Since we're building a product for engineers, we believe in letting our engineers work on things that interest them and giving them ownership over these products.</p><p>Interview process:</p><p>Phone Screen -&gt; Technical Homework -&gt; Technical Interviews -&gt; Product Interviews -&gt; Offer!</p><p>Check out our careers page: <a href='https://stackshare.io/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://stackshare.io/careers</a> Apply via AngelList or email us at careers+HN@stackshare.io - if you're emailing us please include your resume and/or LinkedIn profile<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects while concurrently laying the foundation for a stand-alone product which will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We have an excellent four person team in place with Big-4 backend experience. We're looking to get one final person in place to help us define what a modern and maintainable front-end stack should look like and to help build our product. Hopefully that's you.</p><p>Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we aren't as familiar with. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.</p><p>We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.</p><p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]</p><p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.</p><p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.</p><p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].</p><p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href='https://www.noredink.com/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/jobs</a></p><p>[1] <a href='https://www.noredink.com/about/team' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/about/team</a></p><p>[2] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/</a></p><p>[3] <a href='https://github.com/NoRedInk/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/NoRedInk/</a></p><p>[4] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan</a></p><p>[5] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...</a></p><p>[6] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the TODAY Show, The View, and Good Morning America many times. We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 40 employees and $25M annual revenue over the past five years.</p><p>As a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. We believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we’re a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy -- it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.</p><p>We are seeking an ambitious and nice lead engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team’s growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you.</p><p>Learn more about this position and apply at <a href='https://grnh.se/qrifafaj2' rel='nofollow'>https://grnh.se/qrifafaj2</a></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United States</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>USA</p></dd>        </dl>",

We have a good sense of humor and actually manage to get a surprising amount of work done between cracking jokes and having a good time. </span></div><div><b></b></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>What do you even do?</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div></div><div><span>We're a startup (we were just 5 years old on 7th of January 2018) and we have been growing 40%-60% year on year and we’re profitable. We are the leading premium outsourcing platform for the WordPress market. Codeable is the platform that connects clients with WordPress Experts and you will be working on improving and maintaining that platform.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>At Codeable we are all about quality and we're well known for our awesome customer support. Just in case you don't believe us, here is a random quote from one of our customers: &quot;Great job by another very talented Codeable tech! I'll definitely be back.&quot;.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>We currently have around 12 full-time staff members (programmers, marketing, customer support...) and a few working for us part-time (UX, Design). That said, we are currently lacking power in the Frontend &nbsp;&quot;department&quot;. </span></div><div><b></b></div><div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><b>What am I going to do?</b></span></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span>The thing you do best. We believe that we can get the best out of our people if we focus on the things they do best. </span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>If chosen, you will have a month (or two) long testing period where we see how you fit in the team and how you perform at your work.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>A proactive approach is most wanted since we're not a big company. Meaning if you see something that should be fixed or made better and you can do it, then do it. </span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><span>If you know you can improve something, just do it.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Now to the real business... </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our frontend code needs a bit of a &quot;face-lift&quot; and some optimization and refactoring. At the same time, we would like to change a bit how we are building our application.&nbsp;</span>We're not aiming for the &quot;big rewrite&quot;. What we have in mind is a gradual approach to improving our code. An evolution of some kind.</div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><b></b></div><div><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><b>What do I need?</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li><span>Good grasp of JavaScript and AngularJS v1</span><br></li><li><span>Solid knowledge of SPA applications</span><br></li><li><span>Familiarity with continuous integration and continuous deployment and agile methodologies</span><br></li><li><span>Understanding of REST</span><br></li><li><span>Great relationship with Git</span><br></li><li><span>Previous experience with refactoring code (preferably not just your own)</span><br></li><li><span>Experience with writing tests (unit/integration/…) - we don’t have many but we’d like to have many more</span><br></li><li><span>Curious gene (you have to love testing new stuff and doubting and improving old)</span><br></li><li><span>A habit of QA-ing your own work locally and on staging environment before deployment (of course)</span><br></li><li><span>Openness to other platforms and approaches/methodologies.
