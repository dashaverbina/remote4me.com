Your work will empower over 8,000 businesses around the world to provide great customer service, and will support other senior engineers on your team.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Tools we use</h4></div><ul><li>PHP 7.x</li><li>Lumen, Laravel, and Symfony</li><li>Backbone.js, Marionette.js, and React.js</li><li>Node.js</li><li>RabbitMQ</li><li>Redis</li><li>Pusher</li><li>Java(APIs)</li><li>MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB</li></ul><div><h4>About the role</h4></div><ul><li>The engineering team currently has thirty-four talented engineers. &nbsp;You will be working on one of the Help Scout web app teams, which currently has 6 engineers (PHP, JavaScript). On a typical day you may help a customer with an issue, work on a new feature, create a third party integration or enhance back-end tools to support our growth team. On any given project, you will be communicating with internal APIs, integrating with 3rd party services, optimizing processes using Redis, RabbitMQ, various AWS services, and wrapping it all up in support of a Backbone/Marionette or React front end.</li><li>Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/agile-remote-teams/' rel='nofollow'>remote, agile development</a>. When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with test cases and tag your team for review (often over a video and screen-sharing session).&nbsp;</li><li>We have invested heavily in local Docker development and cloud-based continuous integration and delivery so you can get setup fast and your development branch can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our top-notch in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li></ul><div><h4>About you</h4></div><ul><li>You are very experienced with modern PHP development practices and open source frameworks. You’ve worked on these sorts of projects at scale and feel confident solving complex problems. You view “best practices” as a starting point for critical thinking, rather than a dogma to follow.&nbsp;</li><li>You have created a single page application using Backbone (or a similar framework) and can write JavaScript from scratch to implement a feature. Marionette and/or React experience is a bonus, but not required. We can help you pick it up.</li><li>Your code is not only reliable and performant for customers, but can be read, maintained and understood easily by other engineers on your team. The&nbsp;<a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/' rel='nofollow'>Zen of Python</a>&nbsp;resonates with you for any language.</li><li>You believe in writing unit and integration tests and have at least tried TDD. You like owning the quality of the code you write— QA doesn’t mean throwing it over the wall for someone else to test. You understand that some things are too costly to automate and must be manually tested to get it right.&nbsp;</li><li>You take pride in your work and ownership of the solutions you build. When a team member or customer is in need, you feel a sense of urgency to understand their pain and thoughtfully help.</li><li>You are curious and constantly learning. Believing that “a rising tide lifts all ships,” you make everyone around you better sharing what you have learned and looking for ways to improve both yourself and the team. &nbsp;</li><li>You are a humble professional who wants to be challenged by the work and not the workload. You are willing to ask for help when necessary and unafraid to say “I don’t know.” At the same time, you have the confidence to take on complex and challenging problems.</li><li>You are proactive about solving problems and improving things. You take the initiative to build tools and processes that will help everyone. When working in the codebase, you leave things better than you found them.</li><li>You are an excellent communicator who can write and speak with empathy for our customers and team. You can easily communicate complex ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM- 6PM ET).</li></ul><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well. The formula we use to calculate all salaries is public to employees and is improved upon regularly.</li><li><span>Work anywhere</span>- We’ll fly you to Boston for a week of new employee on-boarding and buy your home office furniture or help you pay for a co-working space.

Vivoom adds super-high-end branded video effects \nand assets. Consumers share broadly. Their friends and followers watch it, like \nit, and are a look-alike audience. Brands republish. It's user-generated \nadvertising that works incredibly well and everyone feels good about it. Vivoom \nwants infrastructure developers with cloud and/or video experience.\n\n\n ENVIRONMENT\n\n You'll wear lots of hats. As a startup, we believe all developers should \nunderstand operations and all &quot;ops&quot; should be software engineers. As a company, \nwe want everyone to shape our product.\n\n Vivoom is looking for experienced engineers near its Flemington, NJ and/or \nBoston, MA offices. We live with video conferencing and Slack. Telecommuting is \navailable for candidates, but we believe it's good to mix it up in person too. \nYou will report directly to Vivoom's co-founder and CTO.\n\n\n PROJECTS (CHOOSE 2)\n\n * Infrastructure Development for Video Effects and Assembly\n * Cloud-based DevOps Automation\n * Self-Serve Client Platform Development\n\n\n THINGS YOU'LL USE\n\n * Languages (Python, Java, shells)\n * Platforms (Linux, Apache, nginx, MySQL, MongoDB, EC2, S3, Docker)\n * Workflow (Git, JIRA, SCRUM)\n\n\n BONUS SKILLS\n\n * Old School (threads, forks, named pipes, daemons, message queues, etc.)\n * Dev Ops (AWS autoscale, AMIs, ELBs, DNS, CDNs, VPCs, NFS, monitoring, \nalarms)\n * Lighter Side (JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, REST, Social APIs, SQL, CMSs)\n * Heavier Side (ffmpeg, neural networks, video concepts, audio concepts)\n * Troubleshooting\n\n\n ABOUT VIVOOM\n\n Vivoom is a cutting-edge, fast growing technology company that is disrupting \nthe way brands reach consumers. From the perspective of today's consumer, if \nyour product doesn't seamlessly enable consumer sharing, it's broken. Products \nthat enable sharing are gaining market share and emerging as market leaders.\n\n Vivoom powers the always-on consumer sharing capabilities that let clients \nfurther improve the product experience for the consumer and further monetize \ntheir brand IP. Vivoom's white-labeled consumer sharing experience can be \ndropped into brand's digital or physical products and channels to provide \nseamless sharing right from the brand's products with fun branded filters for \ntheir consumers to share across any and all social and messaging platforms.\n\n Vivoom's platform provides the brand-safety and control, the republishing and \nthe analytics capabilities needed to ensure consumer created content is safe, \non-brand and delivering engagement results that dramatically outperform paid \ninterruptive ads.\n\n Vivoom is driven by highly proprietary IP and is led by executives with \nproven track records as pioneers in media, advertising, and technology.\n\n Vivoom is powering the in-product sharing capabilities for world-class \ncompanies including Microsoft, Capital One, Johnson & Johnson, Boston Celtics, \nUnivision and more.\n\n\n HOW TO APPLY\n\n Click reply and include your resume and something about yourself. \n * Principals only.

Our software allows healthcare providers and patients to make better decisions faster. We're looking for talented software engineers to join our team in solving some of the most difficult problems in HIE.</p><p>CareEvolution's stack has been selected as the technical infrastructure for seven statewide exchanges in the US. We also have other large public and private exchange networks, as well as health plan exchanges in active deployment.</p><p>Our team is quite small, but all of us are technical people. We maintain a strong start-up/hacker culture. CareEvolution has partnered with a few large companies with relationships in all 50 states - and beyond - to supply a large portion of our sales and marketing efforts. &nbsp;Our stack is recognized by leading HIE industry analysts as the most technologically sophisticated HIE on the market - by a significant margin. &nbsp;Mention the word sesquipedalian in your employment application to have it processed quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>We are focused and execute very quickly. But we also have a lot of fun - biweekly visits to the bar, daily ping pong/foosball/darts games in the office, hackathons every eight weeks for pet projects, biannual company-wide get-togethers, board game nights, rock climbing nights, disc golf days... etc. We are also a very family-friendly organization.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75K-100K (Mid-Level) and $100-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates within a 3 hour drive of Louisville, KY are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

The thought of solving a problem in an entirely new programming language, one you have never even heard of before, excites you.</li><li><strong>Technical Diversity</strong>: while we all have our preferences when it comes to programming languages or operating systems, you should be willing to work with anything, in any language, if that’s what it takes to get the job done. If you are easily lead into a “______ rocks, everything else sucks” mentality, this isn’t the job for you.</li><li><strong>Flexible</strong>: we are small, things change.

We're Scripto, the software company that The New Yorker recently called &quot;<a href='https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-scripto-the-app-that-stephen-colbert-helped-build-became-a-fixture-of-late-night-comedy-news' rel='nofollow'>a fixture of late-night comedy news</a>.&quot; It was a great start to the year, but we have even bigger plans, and we hope you'll apply to join us as a Developer. You'll be working on Showrunner, our next-generation product for screenwriters, sketch groups, sitcoms, and films.</p><p>We're looking for someone who enjoys the challenge of connecting users to APIs in an elegant and friendly way; you should be excited at the prospect of architecting and then implementing new mission-critical features that play well with our existing systems. Here's a partial list of the technologies we use every day: Choo, Nanocomponent, Codemirror, Bankai, Take-Five, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, CommonJS, and Node (6, moving to 8). You don't have to know all of those cold, even our CTO picked up (or&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/scriptoLLC/take-five' rel='nofollow'>created</a>!) some of them here at Scripto. What we'd like to see from you is 3-5 years of production JS experience, with a record of shipping software and learning on the fly. You should easily be able to point to complete projects you've devised and built, like features of a large package, or whole apps if they’re on the smaller side. Your work doesn't have to be open-source or public, but it should have real users and stakes.</p><p>We are a proudly remote company with flexible hours and health, dental, and vision benefits. We hire inclusively and value diversity. It should be noted, this position is only open to candidates in the USA. To apply, please&nbsp;submit a résumé and cover letter&nbsp;– we can't wait to hear from you.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Scripto            </h2>            <div><p>Scripto began in the early 2010s at the Colbert Report, when writer (and CEO) <a href='https://twitter.com/robdubbin' rel='nofollow'>Rob Dubbin</a> thought there&nbsp;should be a better way for the dozens of people who made&nbsp;the show every day to collaborate. It is now&nbsp;a&nbsp;thriving enterprise product whose clients have won the last&nbsp;six consecutive Emmys for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Writing_for_a_Variety_Series' rel='nofollow'>Outstanding Writing in a Comedy/Variety Series</a>.

Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a>&nbsp;with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel&nbsp;way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d&nbsp;<a href='https://cl.ly/2i0V3z453H2K' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use&nbsp;the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. Here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Micro-service backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a true full-stack developer that can build a features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile). Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Trajectory </strong></p><p>The main thing we care about is shipping great products that have an impact on education. But we hire for skills and attitude over experience, so we wanted to share our thoughts on <a href='https://cl.ly/0k062R1T1R3V' rel='nofollow'>the path you’ll have within Aula</a>. This framework will also form the basis of your one-on-ones. The timeline is just indicative: for experienced developers it might be much, much quicker - either way, we’ll support you to get there as fast as humanly possible.</p><p><strong>Benefits </strong></p><p>We hope you’ll join us for the mission, the work and the people. But hey… </p><p><strong> Work on hard and important problems </strong>with people who care.</p><p><strong>  &nbsp;Focus on your trajectory, not just your role. </strong>Dedicate 3 hours a week to building the skills and connections you’ll need for your dream position at Aula in 3 years.</p><p> &nbsp;<strong>Shared ownership: </strong>Joining the Aula journey means you will own part of the company.</p><p><strong> &nbsp;Learning &amp; Development stipend: </strong>Receive a small stipend for any training you would like to do in your spare time.</p><p><strong> &nbsp;Work remotely: </strong>Our developers have full flexibility to live and work wherever they please.</p><p><strong> &nbsp;Technology: </strong>Get hooked up with the technology to do your best work.</p><p> &nbsp;<strong>Free books:</strong> We’re all about books. We’ll send you as many as you can read.</p><p> &nbsp;<strong>Family Leave:</strong> If your family grows while at Aula, we recommend taking 1-3 months off - regardless of when you joined.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>You have both front-end&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;back-end experience</li><li>You have experience with React - unless you have significant Javascript experience with other libraries, so that you’ll be able to pick it up quickly</li><li>You have experience creating and iterating on products from end-to-end: we think there are certain things that freelance and agency work doesn’t teach you such working end-to-end (full feature) on an entire system.</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.</li></ul><p>We’re open to people at different experience levels as long as you feel this description captures you well.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role.

A typical building contains thousands of pieces of equipment, sensors, and interconnections. Gridium makes software that helps people run their buildings better, at lower cost and with less energy.</div><div><br></div><div>We're looking for a US-based engineer to design, develop, and scale our backend services. At Gridium we manage quite a bit of data, pouring in daily from hundreds of thousands of electricity meters. We need help gathering data from a variety of sources and connecting it to our web applications. That’s where you come in.</div><div><br></div><div><b>ABOUT GRIDIUM</b></div><div>--------------</div><div>Gridium is a growing, venture-backed SaaS software provider for buildings. Our products help commercial property owners manage all aspects of their buildings, from energy to work orders. We serve buildings of every shape and size, deploying a range of statistical and machine learning techniques to help develop energy efficiency strategies, streamline operations, and delight tenants.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a distributed company, so all employees work remotely. Remote work allows us to find great people wherever they happen to be, and it allows you to structure your day flexibly and with minimal interruption so that you can get stuff done in the style that makes most sense for you.</div><div><br></div><div><b>U.S.-based applicants only please. We are not currently hiring overseas (or over borders)</b></div><div><br></div><div>Of course, spending time face-to-face is important, so once a quarter we pick a city and meet up for several days of highly productive and highly fun planning and doing (and eating and recreating). Past trips include Austin, Breckenridge, Chicago, New Orleans, San Diego, and more.</div><div><br></div><div>We have a casual work environment where everyone's ideas and opinions matter. We are committed to work-life balance and offer everyone opportunities to learn, experiment, and grow. Since creative, enthusiastic employees are the basis for our success, we take great care and pride in how we attract, hire, and support our employees.</div><div><br></div><div><b>ABOUT THE JOB</b></div><div>--------------</div><div>Without Gridium, our customers’ valuable energy data is trapped on clunky, outdated utility websites. You will be responsible for figuring out how to reliably and efficiently pull in large amounts of data from a variety of sources. You'll write web scrapers with headless browsers, configure OAuth API calls, receive webhooks, and more. You'll design, develop, and scale internal APIs to work seamlessly within a modern web application framework.</div><div><br></div><div>Our stack lives on AWS and includes Docker, Postgres, Java, Python, and Ember.js. You don't need to be an expert in any of these; we're more interested in your ability to solve problems effectively with whatever tools make the most sense.</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Are you comfortable working in a remote environment?<br></li><li>Are you passionate about writing testable code?<br></li><li>Do you enjoy connecting the dots between APIs?<br></li><li>Does freeing data from a clunky external website sound like a fun challenge?<br></li><li>Are you a wizard at debugging services with lots of moving parts?<br></li><li>Are you familiar with Amazon cloud services?<br></li><li>Are you obsessed with data?<br></li><li>Do you want to truly own the systems you work on?</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If so, Gridium is the place for you.</div><div><br></div><div><b>BENEFITS</b></div><div>--------</div><div>The position comes with salary, stock options, 401(k) match, a great health plan, vision, dental, generous parental leave, and a flexible vacation policy — we want you to take the time off you need so that you are happy and productive.</div><div><br></div><div><b>AND OF COURSE</b></div><div>--------------</div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</a></p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

We appreciate that we've built a reasonably-sized, high-powered team so far (61 employees including 29 engineers) and are always striving to be the best place to work we can be.</p><p>If this sings to you, come join us!<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

    "title": "Logikcull: Senior Back-End Engineer",
    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Senior Back-End Engineer</h2>      <h4>Posted Feb  1</h4>    <h3>      <span>Logikcull</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: San Francisco (Open to Remote) </span><br>        <a href='https://logikcull.com/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://logikcull.com/jobs/</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>You’ve of course heard of Dropbox. You probably use it or a similar service on a daily basis. Now imagine a service where users upload entire email databases, zip files, images, hard drives of content, and pretty much anything they need to search through. Simple enough. That’s what S3 is for, right? But here’s the catch, unlike Dropbox and similar services, Logikcull’s job is to rip the data apart, analyze the hell out of it, and then organize it into logical search buckets so that legal teams around the world can easily and quickly sift through it.</div><div><br></div><div>This of course requires massive computing, massive storage, and an ever expanding infrastructure to support them all. Our challenges are a unique mix of broad and deep because the data we need to get at is always mixed up with other data. Emails have attachments, word documents wrap human-readable content in data structures and almost anything can be printed to PDF. Our system has to be smart enough to recognize everything in order to unpack it properly, graceful enough to remember complex relationships between documents and fast enough to rip through gigabytes concurrently at scale.</div><div><br></div><div>And all of this needs to happen at scale, for all of our customers (in 34 different countries and growing),&nbsp;<strong>within minutes or hours from the first upload</strong>. Insane, right?</div><div><br></div><div>It’s controlled chaos at scale and we love it. And here’s why:</div><div><br></div><div>The technical challenges are staggering. And that’s usually enough to keep a top engineer happy for quite some time. But it’s the impact Logikcull is having on our society that is even more rewarding. For instance, governments can now turn around open records requests (i.e. FOIA), within days by using Logikcull. Prior to Logikcull, this process used to take weeks, months, and, we’re not kidding, years, to complete. Blocking government information to citizens lawfully requesting that information is counter to a healthy democracy.</div><div><br></div><div>Another example where Logikcull is having an impact on our society is litigation. To us, litigation can be a means to affect positive change (<a href='http://logikcull.com/blog/into-the-wild-earthjustice-amanda-sharp/' rel='nofollow'>see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves, not a joke</a>) and it allows people of all means to get access to justice. But getting access to justice also means being able to afford litigation. And one of the biggest costs to litigation is sifting through data (i.e. discovery or e-discovery). Logikcull makes it easy, fast, and affordable for anyone to sift through data for litigation, which means that citizens and businesses can not only get access to justice, but also save a ton of money - in some cases, millions of dollars are saved by using Logikcull. For a business, the cost savings can be pumped back into the business for growth, employee benefits, and more.</div><div><br></div><div>This is why we do what we do. And the positive team-focused engineering culture at Logikcull makes working on these massive problems even more rewarding. If this is something you would like to be a part of, we’d love to hear from you.</div><div><br></div><div>Our current stack includes: Rails, Backbone + Marionette, MySQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch, all running in AWS.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Job Responsibilities</strong><br></div><ul><li>You will take ownership within our codebase, writing, maintaining clean, modular code.</li><li>You are able to take a design/proposal and carry it through to a thoughtful and polished end result with good test coverage.</li><li>You will support our amazing Customer Success team in helping diagnose/explain user-reported bugs and fix existing bugs.</li><li>You will review code written by other engineers and provide useful and honest feedback.</li><li>You will help with architecting solutions to scale our proprietary data processing platform for 10x, 100x, and beyond. &nbsp;</li><li>You will participate in on-call rotations and work effectively and collaboratively during site outages.</li></ul><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Job Requirements</strong><br></div><ul><li>You have 4+ years of experience in the Ruby language in a production environment.</li><li>You have a good understanding of highly distributed processing systems.</li><li>You are comfortable navigating through complex data structures and algorithms, and have a strong desire to produce optimal code for speed and efficiency.</li><li>You are familiar with the basics of scalable software design and architecture.</li><li>[Bonus] You have experience with Elasticsearch and/or other search technologies.</li><li>[Bonus] You have experience with MongoDB and/or other NoSQL technologies.</li><li>[Bonus] You have a solid understanding of file formats, particularly document formats, e.g. (MS Word, Excel, Outlook, Acrobat, Etc...).</li><li>You have excellent communication skills and the willingness to share your expertise.</li><li>You are pragmatic and sensible in your approach to problem solving.</li><li>You are able to think critically and gather data to constructively support your position.</li></ul><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Our Culture&nbsp;</strong><br></div><ul><li>Engineers at Logikcull are highly technical, independent, and self organized.

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</a></p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

Some of our products that are of broad general use are included in an open source RexDB (<a href='https://rexdb.org' rel='nofollow'>https://rexdb.org</a>) platform.</p><p>As a remote-first team, we value collaborative developers who excel at written communication, enjoy working with product users, and are self-directed.

Proficiency with full-stack implementations and security standards (<a href='https://owasp.org' rel='nofollow'>https://owasp.org</a>) is important.</p><p>In this position, you'll be expected to drive key parts of our medical research registry product.  This involves looking at various client solutions, abstracting out shared functionality, documenting/implementing shared works, and helping our custom development team with transition.  You'll be working with FHIR, an emerging HL7 standard for medical data sharing.</p><p>This year we'll be branching out to use Julia for backend data analytics and ReasonML/OCaml for our front end development.

We envision a world where everyone can access the internet affordably, free of interference or censorship and with full privacy.</p><p>Our goal—always—is to build tech-enhanced campaigns that resonate with millions of people, enabling them to consolidate their power and win historic changes thought to be impossible. In 2012 we organized the largest online protest in history, an internet-wide strike against web censorship which defeated the SOPA and PIPA bills. More recently, our Battle for the Net campaign drove nearly four million people to contact the FCC resulting in the game-changing passage of net neutrality rules (a “First Amendment” for the Internet). <a href='https://www.battleforthenet.com/how-we-won/' rel='nofollow'>Here’s exactly how we did it.</a> Our Reset the Net campaign organized around protecting the privacy of hundreds of million of internet users.</p><p>Our accomplishments are testament to the notion that with the right approach and creative activism, the public interest can prevail—even over some of the most entrenched political forces in the world.

The platform is currently in use by over 130 customers, and security operations centers that are 24x7.</p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>We prefer candidates local to the Plano, TX area. We are open to the right candidate even if you are remote. If you are remote and believe you are the right person for the job - send us some code, change our mind!</p><p><strong>The Traits Our Backend Developers Have</strong></p><ol><li>Fluent in Django/Python.</li><li>Passion for front end development. In some cases this is mobile app development, in other cases, it's integration with other products that need to consume our APIs, or web development with AngularJS. This helps build better backends when you are the consumer.</li><li>Possess strongly held beliefs and aren't afraid to voice them. Opinions are usually based on something very specific related either to past experiences or to the platform, and very rarely theoretical.</li><li>At least one specific area of excellence in the skills mentioned below - you know this cold!</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills You'll Need </strong></p><ol><li>Python/Django - We use lots of it.&nbsp;</li><li>Docker, AWS - specifically the following services - ECS, S3, SQS.</li><li>PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana - Core of the platform.</li><li>RabbitMQ, Terraform and other ancillary services that we offer.</li><li>Front End - Pick one: React Native, Angular, Swift, Android.</li></ol><p><strong>The Interview Process </strong></p><ol><li>If you like what you've heard so far and want to come work for us, please send us your resume along with some code samples!</li><li>Give us three (3) days to review and respond. We'll try to respond to everyone who appears to be a good fit.</li><li>A hands-on coding challenge.</li><li>A 60-minute technical conversation about the coding challenge and your resume.</li><li>An in-person interview at our offices.</li><li>A finalized job offer.</li></ol>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Advanced Threat Analytics, Inc.            </h2>            <div><p>Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) is helping MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers) and enterprises finally break free of “alert tyranny” – a state when the volume of security alerts grows so out of control – it dictates staffing levels and operational business models. Traditional SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and incident orchestration solutions try to address the issue by reducing the time it takes to investigate each incident. They do not address the volume issue. ATA takes a different approach – we attack the problem by dramatically slashing the total number of incidents you need to investigate – freeing you from alert overload. This enables you to take a more efficient, effective, and strategic approach to security operations.</p><p><strong>Why Us?</strong></p><ol><li>We are incredibly fast-paced. You must be able to get on board with our pace.</li><li>We turn on a dime - something that sounds like a good idea today, doesn't mean it is - we are fine with that. We like to experiment.</li><li>We are growing at 150% YOY, which means a lot more demands from customers - we like to delight them all!</li><li>Equity and work culture is fantastic! We love what we do and it shows in our work.</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Flexible Hours, Work from anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 401k                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid Holidays, Vacation, and Sick Time                            </div>                            <div>                                 Competitive Salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 Strong Partnerships                            </div>                            <div>                                 Talented coworkers                            </div>                    ",
