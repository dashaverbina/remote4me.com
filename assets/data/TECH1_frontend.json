Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for.

The platform is currently in use by over 130 customers, and security operations centers that are 24x7.</p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>We prefer candidates local to the Plano, TX area. We are open to the right candidate even if you are remote. If you are remote and believe you are the right person for the job - send us some code, change our mind!</p><p><strong>The Traits Our Backend Developers Have</strong></p><ol><li>Fluent in Django/Python.</li><li>Passion for front end development. In some cases this is mobile app development, in other cases, it's integration with other products that need to consume our APIs, or web development with AngularJS. This helps build better backends when you are the consumer.</li><li>Possess strongly held beliefs and aren't afraid to voice them. Opinions are usually based on something very specific related either to past experiences or to the platform, and very rarely theoretical.</li><li>At least one specific area of excellence in the skills mentioned below - you know this cold!</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills You'll Need </strong></p><ol><li>Python/Django - We use lots of it.&nbsp;</li><li>Docker, AWS - specifically the following services - ECS, S3, SQS.</li><li>PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana - Core of the platform.</li><li>RabbitMQ, Terraform and other ancillary services that we offer.</li><li>Front End - Pick one: React Native, Angular, Swift, Android.</li></ol><p><strong>The Interview Process </strong></p><ol><li>If you like what you've heard so far and want to come work for us, please send us your resume along with some code samples!</li><li>Give us three (3) days to review and respond. We'll try to respond to everyone who appears to be a good fit.</li><li>A hands-on coding challenge.</li><li>A 60-minute technical conversation about the coding challenge and your resume.</li><li>An in-person interview at our offices.</li><li>A finalized job offer.</li></ol>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Advanced Threat Analytics, Inc.            </h2>            <div><p>Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) is helping MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers) and enterprises finally break free of “alert tyranny” – a state when the volume of security alerts grows so out of control – it dictates staffing levels and operational business models. Traditional SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and incident orchestration solutions try to address the issue by reducing the time it takes to investigate each incident. They do not address the volume issue. ATA takes a different approach – we attack the problem by dramatically slashing the total number of incidents you need to investigate – freeing you from alert overload. This enables you to take a more efficient, effective, and strategic approach to security operations.</p><p><strong>Why Us?</strong></p><ol><li>We are incredibly fast-paced. You must be able to get on board with our pace.</li><li>We turn on a dime - something that sounds like a good idea today, doesn't mean it is - we are fine with that. We like to experiment.</li><li>We are growing at 150% YOY, which means a lot more demands from customers - we like to delight them all!</li><li>Equity and work culture is fantastic! We love what we do and it shows in our work.</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Flexible Hours, Work from anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 401k                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid Holidays, Vacation, and Sick Time                            </div>                            <div>                                 Competitive Salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 Strong Partnerships                            </div>                            <div>                                 Talented coworkers                            </div>                    ",

We employ creative problem solvers to work in our office and to work remotely from anywhere around the world.</p><p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p><p>There are many problems current IoT devices on the market face that we wish to solve. Using our own blockchain technology helps us achieve this.</p><p>Above all else, we value our customer’s privacy and security because a home is the most intimate place a person can be. We are a hardware company, looking to develop and sell hardware. This means that we don’t collect or store data about our customers. Our devices are designed to operate without storing customer data on our servers.</p><p>We believe that we can succeed without harvesting our customer’s data because our hardware will succeed.

We are looking for someone with a breadth of knowledge including best practices in front and back end coding, systems architecture, and web design to lead us into the near future. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The Barnes is fully rethinking all aspects of visitor facing technology. As such, you will have the opportunity to build our new technology stack—from the web server all the way to frontend libraries—from a blank slate in the way you think will work best for maintainability, scalability, security, and reliability.&nbsp; While some early decisions have been made, you’ll be working to analyze those choices while thinking about the best past forward for a number of forward-thinking projects. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In addition to working on new digital projects, you will be responsible for creating technology standards and guidelines designed to foster maintainable coding practices and system design while ensuring these standards are implemented across all consultant projects. You will be responsible for conducting code reviews, security audits and any other inspections necessary to ensure projects meet the standards you will help establish. Projects under your supervision will need to be integrated into our new cloud infrastructure. This may include the creation of continuous integration infrastructure to handle the deployment of these projects as they are developed and maintained, as well as a means of managing the security concerns and many software dependencies these projects will introduce. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In this role, you may be coding projects onsite or overseeing consultant teams across multiple cities acting as a project liaison. As projects launch, you’ll be responsible for server maintenance and maintenance automation, including backups, disaster planning, patching and upgrading.

We’re an adtech company empowering publishers and advertisers to connect more efficiently.</p><p>Don’t let the “adtech” part scare you away: our mission is to help publishers better monetize their sites so they can spend their time focusing on what they care about (their content!) rather than selling ads. We leverage tech to help broker these sales, and attempt to distance ourselves from the shady world of advertising that existed before.</p><p>StackOverflow, CodingHorror.com, NPR, and The Atlantic are just some of the sites who we’re able to help make more money - connecting them with advertisers like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Braintree, and Atlassian who are all able to expand their reach through us.</p><p>We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 30 some-odd people spread out across 30+ cities in 5 countries (please note that right now we are requiring a large overlap with Eastern Time, however). We use PHP, Go, Rails, and React, but seek to hire developers who are language agnostic and are more interested in shipping quality code than bikeshedding it.</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p><p>We’re looking for developers at any level (junior, intermediate, senior) to help us build out our platform. Regardless of level, everyone on our dev team makes meaningful contributions that positively impact our team and our customers every day - you will likely ship code on your very first day at BSA.</p><p>Ideally, we’re looking for someone who is:</p><ul><li>Comfortable across the full stack of the development cycle: frontend, backend, database stuff, as well as following through with testing and shipping.</li><li>A self-starter: remote teams carry lots of autonomy. There’s no micromanaging here.</li><li>A great communicator: we’re big on teaching, learning, debating, and explaining, and these things require clear, deliberate communication.</li><li>Wary of bullet lists with more than 3 items in job postings: we aren’t heavily process-oriented or believe in tons of structure, and if your eyes have glazed over while reading this list, you might just fit right in.</li></ul><p>You’re likely more awesome than you think, so please apply even if you only check a few of these boxes.</p><p><strong>Interested?</strong></p><p>Woohoo! To apply, send us a blurb about who you are and what you’re into to devjob_q4_2017@buysellads.com. If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on what you like to build, things you’ve built in the past that you’re proud of, and what you’d like to be building now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</p><p>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straight-forward: we do an initial meet-and-greet phone screen, a live pair-coding session over Slack (our primary mode of communication), and a take-home coding test. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess. (For reference, in our last hiring round in the summer we responded to 100% of direct applicants and the average response time to an applicant was under 24 hours. The average time from initial contact to us extending an offer was 11 days.)</p><p>And if we are the right fit for each other? Awesome! Come build a platform to help fix advertising with us.</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> 100% remote team, high-impact role on a strong engineering team</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

We don't have a Michelin star chef to serve your lunch but we do have an established working from home policy so you can spend more time with your family. We also don't have a barista on-site to serve your almond milk latte, but we are flexible - you can start your day in the office at any time providing you make it for our daily standup (because it is important! and yes, we do have a very good coffee machine).<br /><br />This time we are looking for a Senior Fullstack engineer to take ownership and guide our multi-skilled development team. You will be working alongside management and the backend lead to deliver applications for a new retail platform using the very latest JavaScript technologies and Frameworks.<br /><br />We are constantly building new applications for our clients - Marks and Spencer, GAP and many more. Working on a real-time collaboration software is challenging - you will have to learn new technologies and prototype new apps at a speed of light, but not because it is a high-pressure environment, simply because you like to see your code working in production. That said, we don't tolerate sloppy coding - for every single line of code we write, there is almost always a line of unit-testing code.<br /><br />If you're a frontend lead right now or a driven senior engineer with a burning desire for a career progression and a skillset to match - get in touch!<br /><br />Skills &amp; Requirements<br /><br />Must have<br />* Strong experience developing web apps and mobile-first websites<br />* 5+ years experience in development using modern stacks / frameworks / technologies<br />* An expert understanding of Javascript (ES6) <br />* Experience with OO and MVC design patterns<br />* Understanding of functional programming<br />* Solid experience with React/Redux/Redux-saga<br />* Solid experience with Node.js<br />* Knowledge of when and how to apply design patterns<br />* Good grasp of functional programming and SOLID principles<br />* TDD/Unit testing<br />* Clean code is your second nature<br />* Experience with testing frameworks such as jest, mocha, chai etc...<br />* Experience developing SaaS products<br />* Previous experience of managing, mentoring and coaching teams of engineers<br />* Worked previously in an international environment<br />* Links to existing work or projects on Git<br />* Experience with AWS<br /><br />Nice to have<br />* Other programming languages (Go, Rust)<br />* Experience designing APIs from scratch<br />* Kubernetes/Docker<br />* Exposure to event-sourcing architecture<br />* Experience with CQRS",

It’s People Powered Data that allows them to understand not only “what” is happening, but “why.” SurveyMonkey’s 700+ employees throughout North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are dedicated to powering the curious.</p><p><strong>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</strong></p><p>SurveyMonkey’s platform is used for a myriad of purposes across a broad spectrum of industries.

    "content": "*Full Stack Software Engineer (Go/Javascript/HTML/CSS)*<br /><br />To us, being a Full Stack engineer is a mindset, you need to be competent in your core skills and excited to learn and try new things as and when you see a fit or need.  No one wants to spread themselves too thinly and that is why we have carefully selected our few core technologies but we are not afraid of trying anything new that may be right for the job.  If you agree with this then read on, it should hopefully mean that you are someone that likes to self improve.<br />This role is to be the first tech hire alongside Nub’s founder.  You will be a key hire and valued highly if you can work hard as a team towards the aims of the company.  Your judgement will be valued as we work towards engineering a unique multi-platform application with a web app based UI and a Go based back end.<br /><br />*About you:*<br />- You are a dedicated and resourceful engineer<br />- 2+ years of professional Full Stack Software Engineering Experience<br />- Proven experience of completing HTML/CSS/Javascript deliverables (web app development not brochure style websites)<br />- Competence in Go (Golang) but if you have experience delivering software with another language (such as Python) and are keen to learn Go that may work.<br />- Competence writing SQL<br />- Happy to work with Node.js, Electron, ES6, Babel, Webpack.<br />- Exposure to Vuejs or similar (e.g. react)<br />- You love staying on top of the latest developments in software development <br />- Must be authorized to work in the UK<br />- Happy to work from home but meet in London for regular meetings.<br /><br />*About Nub:*<br />Lego for written comms. Modular utility, ubiquity and unique accessibility.<br /><br />Nub makes sending beautiful and personalised emails, invoices, forms, itineraries, receipts etc as easy as building with lego.  Comprised of an engine and codeless tools to automate data capture, data manipulation and subsequent output primarily via email, pdf, print, data, or api.  Triggered by any system, language or data and achieved without the need to be a programmer.<br /><br />This kit will mean everyone can create cool customer communications on a new, automated, intuitive and scalable platform.  It will allow anyone to handle data transformation and create automated output such as print, pdf or email.  Have control over branding, designs customisation and personalisation.<br /><br />Developers will love this because it removes a complex distraction from their applications. Companies large and small will love this because it will allow custom communications from any system to their employees or clients.<br />Anyone looking to automate data transformation from one format to the other will love this because  they will find it a breeze to achieve.<br /><br />*Why work for us?*<br />Nub is a new startup, the plan is to grow and become something every developer wants to use and every company choses to use...   The CEO has a proven track record in this field and a forensic knowledge of the current technology and a clear vision of its potential. <br /><br />You’ll get to work from home and help define our culture as the company grows.  The plan is for a London office when the time is right.  The CEO has a family, likes coffee, tech, would love a dog, used to race cars and loves sport.<br /><br />You may want to exit the corporate world and enter into an exciting journey with an early stage startup.  You may be bored of coding to someone else's spec, getting stuck in meetings and not being able to be creative with your code.  Work at Nub and that will change.<br />Perhaps you are a brilliant coder looking for a great idea – this is it!",

Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller. &nbsp;We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

No, backbone.js is not this week's hottest JS framework, but that's because these apps have been used and enhanced over the last 3 years in production. They've stood the test of time. But we are using the latest tooling alongside - ES6, webpack, less, nightwatch.js etc to make development as clean as possible.</p><p>Are you passionate about efficient client-side performance and robust, scalable platforms? Do you understand the underlying principles of JS (and haven't just built a simple Angular app)? We're adding to our team to build out our Javascript clients for our API-driven microservice retail platform of 18 loosely coupled services. It’s in production, supporting multiple brands and driving millions of dollars of revenue every month from US sales.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with a globally distributed team of 65. We’re proud of the way we get great work done. Our clients love working with us and partner with us on long-term projects.</p><p><strong>What do we offer?</strong></p><ul><li>Work as part of a talented, globally distributed, successful&nbsp;team</li><li>A focussed adherence to our agile/scrum processes (we really believe it helps getting good work done)</li><li>Hard problems to solve (you won't find all the answers on Stack Overflow) - and the opportunity to own the solutions</li><li>A great working atmosphere where you can share and learn with other smart people</li><li>The best-in-class toolsets: Slack, CI/CD with Docker etc</li><li>Meetups in our Barcelona offices for our remote folks</li><li>Competitive rates</li><li>A long term working relationship</li></ul><p><strong>You'll be:</strong></p><ul><li>Building complex Javascript (mainly ES6, webpack) presentation layers to consume RESTful APIs in a performant way.</li><li>Extracting re-usable components to share across multiple SPAs</li><li>Working on ecommerce and back-office direct sales functionality to support hundreds of thousands of customers.</li><li>Helping the backend engineers in designing, specifying and implementing services to decouple functionality</li><li>Occasionally going full stack and diving in the Rails services to add a new endpoint or modify behavior (and we can help you learn here too)</li><li>Working within&nbsp;a fast moving team (working 11am - 8pm Central European time)</li><li>Identifying bottlenecks, using tools to diagnose and refactor code for scale</li><li>Ensuring the robustness, performance and failure characteristics of the system.</li><li>Writing well tested, defect free code with CI/CD</li><li>Taking ownership of production applications - managing issues, releases and ensuring quality</li></ul><p>Good English verbal and written communication skills are essential. As is production experience of React/Vue/Angular/Backbone framework applications.</p><p>This is a contract position with a long term outlook (12 months+&nbsp;full-time project) for the right candidate.

Sure, we can list the latest set of technologies that we use, but that is a given. What's more interesting is how they are used - the design, the architecture, the approach to solving business problems. And we do that across multiple clients - each and every one we're excited to work with.</p><p>Because we believe in constant learning and exploring - whether that’s a new skill, a new role, or a new way of seeing.&nbsp; And because we've found that we learn the most when we take on new challenges as a team.&nbsp; We’re proud that people love working with us (and still have lives outside of work).

We&nbsp;communicate using Slack, frequent video calls, and occasional in-person&nbsp;meet-ups (3-4 times per year). We're proud of both the team we’ve created and what we’ve achieved so far. We’re punching above our weight and are expanding our team to achieve even more.</p><p>We’re still a relatively small team. We’re all good at what we do and enjoy working together. You’ll have autonomy and respect from day one. No regulations or hierarchy, just a lot of interesting and challenging work to get done. You’ll work on our React Native mobile apps, so we’re looking for people who have extensive experience of Javascript and React. If you know React but not React Native, we think you’ll pick it up pretty quickly. Knowledge of Redux, Flow, GraphQL, native modules, C++ is a bonus.</p><p>The most important skill to us is being able to pick up new concepts and technologies rapidly. Ideally, you're the sort of person who has been programming from an early age, thrives on new challenges, is passionate about technology, takes pride in finding elegant solutions to difficult problems, and has a record of open source project involvement.&nbsp;We hope to find individuals full of energy and enthusiasm, with an eye for detail &amp; good design.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the day-to-day realities of programming.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75K-95K (Mid-Level) and $95-115K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>I know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>If you are local, we do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights. The full job description for both positions are on our website and includes salary information, videos, and instructions on applying: <a href='https://level12.io/careers/' rel='nofollow'>https://level12.io/careers/</a></p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Character First</strong></p><p>Level 12 is <a href='https://www.level12.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>founded on biblical principles</a> and has biblically informed goals. Accordingly, the reputation of Level 12 and the character of our employees is of utmost importance. You <strong>do not</strong> need to share our leadership's religious convictions, but you will need to share our commitment to the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: honest, trustworthy, reliable, ethical. We have high moral standards and we expect our employees to share those standards. If you use pirated software or media, don’t mind “tweaking” the truth, or think `porn == entertainment`, this is not the job for you!</li><li><strong>Good work ethic</strong>: you work hard and like to work hard. You also work efficiently, seeking to make the best use of your time.</li><li><strong>Dedicated</strong>: you really desire to contribute to and improve our company; you are not just earning a paycheck. You demonstrate a high level of “ownership” for and initiative with projects that are assigned to you.</li><li><strong>Teachable</strong>: you have a willingness and desire for feedback/correction. You are always looking to improve. You are willing to ask for help even if it makes you “look bad.”</li><li><strong>Resourceful</strong>: you know how to solve problems or are at least able to explain that the problem is not solvable with the requirements given. You use all resources at your disposal in an efficient manner to troubleshoot. You know when to ask someone for help and when more effort is needed on your part.</li><li><strong>Technical Prowess</strong>: you just “get” programming, computers, technology.

You can check in with our Director or Engineering to organize any priorities or make sure that your product story is being done right in regards to long-term scalability.

We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything in this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!</p><p>As a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry. You will help us shape the digital guest experience for restaurant brands served by Olo. You will contribute to technology selection, architecture and user experience for our front-end applications.</p><p>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience building user interfaces that put users first and look and feel awesome to use</li><li>Deep knowledge of ES6/ES2015+ and one or more modern Javascript frameworks, with a preference for React or Ember</li><li>Demonstrable understanding of the full .NET web stack</li><li>Leadership experience that spans one or more aspects of technology selection, architecture and design oversight, and mentoring others</li><li>Superb problem solving skills with an emphasis on pragmatism, quality, and performance</li><li>Passion for learning new skills and technologies</li><li>Excellent collaboration skills</li><li>BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience</li><li>Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S.</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo reaches millions of consumers by powering mobile and online ordering for many of the country’s largest restaurant chains. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.</p><p>We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller.  We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!). Check out our culture map.</p><p>Olo is an equal opportunity employer and diversity is valued at our company. All applicants receive consideration for employment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United States</p></dd>        </dl>",
