Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developers who want to add to Kibana and X-Pack?

The platform is currently in use by over 130 customers, and security operations centers that are 24x7.</p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>We prefer candidates local to the Plano, TX area. We are open to the right candidate even if you are remote. If you are remote and believe you are the right person for the job - send us some code, change our mind!</p><p><strong>The Traits Our Backend Developers Have</strong></p><ol><li>Fluent in Django/Python.</li><li>Passion for front end development. In some cases this is mobile app development, in other cases, it's integration with other products that need to consume our APIs, or web development with AngularJS. This helps build better backends when you are the consumer.</li><li>Possess strongly held beliefs and aren't afraid to voice them. Opinions are usually based on something very specific related either to past experiences or to the platform, and very rarely theoretical.</li><li>At least one specific area of excellence in the skills mentioned below - you know this cold!</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills You'll Need </strong></p><ol><li>Python/Django - We use lots of it.&nbsp;</li><li>Docker, AWS - specifically the following services - ECS, S3, SQS.</li><li>PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana - Core of the platform.</li><li>RabbitMQ, Terraform and other ancillary services that we offer.</li><li>Front End - Pick one: React Native, Angular, Swift, Android.</li></ol><p><strong>The Interview Process </strong></p><ol><li>If you like what you've heard so far and want to come work for us, please send us your resume along with some code samples!</li><li>Give us three (3) days to review and respond. We'll try to respond to everyone who appears to be a good fit.</li><li>A hands-on coding challenge.</li><li>A 60-minute technical conversation about the coding challenge and your resume.</li><li>An in-person interview at our offices.</li><li>A finalized job offer.</li></ol>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Advanced Threat Analytics, Inc.            </h2>            <div><p>Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) is helping MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers) and enterprises finally break free of “alert tyranny” – a state when the volume of security alerts grows so out of control – it dictates staffing levels and operational business models. Traditional SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and incident orchestration solutions try to address the issue by reducing the time it takes to investigate each incident. They do not address the volume issue. ATA takes a different approach – we attack the problem by dramatically slashing the total number of incidents you need to investigate – freeing you from alert overload. This enables you to take a more efficient, effective, and strategic approach to security operations.</p><p><strong>Why Us?</strong></p><ol><li>We are incredibly fast-paced. You must be able to get on board with our pace.</li><li>We turn on a dime - something that sounds like a good idea today, doesn't mean it is - we are fine with that. We like to experiment.</li><li>We are growing at 150% YOY, which means a lot more demands from customers - we like to delight them all!</li><li>Equity and work culture is fantastic! We love what we do and it shows in our work.</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Flexible Hours, Work from anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 401k                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid Holidays, Vacation, and Sick Time                            </div>                            <div>                                 Competitive Salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 Strong Partnerships                            </div>                            <div>                                 Talented coworkers                            </div>                    ",

    "content": "<p>Part-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><p>Kin is seeking a UI engineer to join our small, distributed team for on a contract basis for 25-30 hours per week. The position begins immediately and you’re welcome to work remotely so long as you’re in the US and eligible to work here.</p><p>As a UI Engineer, you’re responsible for the entire technical lifecycle of Kin’s UI. That means working with our designer up front on interactions and best practices, then working closely with our back-end engineers to get your work wired into the application.</p><p><strong>About Kin</strong></p><p>Kin is focused on increasing mental health, well-being, engagement and retention within the workplace. We do this by using traditional HRIS features such as paid time-off management and new hire onboarding in reimagined ways that benefit both the employee and the bottom line. We launched in July of 2013, are completely bootstrapped, and we’re passionate about helping innovative companies grow, learn, and thrive.</p><p><strong>Why work at Kin?</strong></p><p>We’re a small, scrappy team. We’re constantly building, releasing, and improving the app, so you’ll see your work ship regularly. Though your primary role will be development, you will have influence on the direction of the product and plenty of transparency into how we run our business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who we’re looking for</strong></p><p>You are a front-end native. You speak clean, semantic, standards-compliant front-end code fluently. You have experience with dynamic CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS, and responsive UI isn’t a mountain you walk around.</p><p>You are absolutely solid with our technology set. Kin is built on Backbone,js, and you’ll be spending at least 50% of your time working directly in it. We use Handlebars for templating and Rivets for data binding. Our backend is built on C#/.NET. Though you don’t need to be fluent in C#, some experience with it is certainly a plus, as is experience with Wordpress. You will also need working knowledge and experience with consuming RESTful APIs.</p><p>You don’t want that job where you're told exactly what to do at every step. To succeed at Kin, you have to be interested in the product, interaction design, sales, and every other facet of the company. This isn't a job for someone who only wants to focus on what falls under a job title. If you’re looking for detailed specs and crisp corners, or are looking to be a cog in a big engine, this isn’t the gig for you.</p><p>You can succeed with a remote team. Our team isn’t huddled in a single location, so you need to be present, aware, and responsive with our distributed team. We use tools like Github, Basecamp, Slack, Google Hangouts, and DoneDone to keep both code and team synced. Constant communication and teamwork make the company tick.</p><p><strong>Additional Expectations</strong></p><ul><li>HTML, CSS, Backbone, Rivets, Handlebars, Javascript, JQuery and more is a plus</li><li>Experience with dynamic CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS</li><li>Experience working with Gulp and Webpack</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</li><li>Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think for yourself.</li><li>Dedication to testing your work</li><li>You are comfortable building templates that will be integrated with server-side code</li><li>You like to document your code as well as keep organized</li><li>Experience working with the Bootstrap framework</li><li>Familiarity working in an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio</li><li>Experience using Litmus to verify that your email templates look as good as possible in different email clients</li><li>Experience using Browserstack or another multi browser testing platform</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

We leverage tech to help broker these sales, and attempt to distance ourselves from the shady world of advertising that existed before.</p><p>StackOverflow, CodingHorror.com, NPR, and The Atlantic are just some of the sites who we’re able to help make more money - connecting them with advertisers like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Braintree, and Atlassian who are all able to expand their reach through us.</p><p>We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 30 some-odd people spread out across 30+ cities in 5 countries (please note that right now we are requiring a large overlap with Eastern Time, however).

There’s no micromanaging here.</li><li>A great communicator: we’re big on teaching, learning, debating, and explaining, and these things require clear, deliberate communication.</li><li>Wary of bullet lists with more than 3 items in job postings: we aren’t heavily process-oriented or believe in tons of structure, and if your eyes have glazed over while reading this list, you might just fit right in.</li></ul><p>You’re likely more awesome than you think, so please apply even if you only check a few of these boxes.</p><p><strong>Interested?</strong></p><p>Woohoo!

If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on what you like to build, things you’ve built in the past that you’re proud of, and what you’d like to be building now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</p><p>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straight-forward: we do an initial meet-and-greet phone screen, a live pair-coding session over Slack (our primary mode of communication), and a take-home coding test. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess. (For reference, in our last hiring round in the summer we responded to 100% of direct applicants and the average response time to an applicant was under 24 hours. The average time from initial contact to us extending an offer was 11 days.)</p><p>And if we are the right fit for each other? Awesome!

How about branching out to VR and AR? Do you like to work in a fast-paced environment with a fantastic product team? Do you feel like your current job is just a job and you have to fight for flexible hours, ability to work from home, and your innovation time is reduced to an occasional hackathon? Are you tired of various business stakeholders treating you like a waiter in a fast-food restaurant? If the answer is yes, then read on and hit that 'Apply Now' button, because we are different!<br /><br />At Concrete we work hard to create a perfect environment for our engineers. We don't have a Michelin star chef to serve your lunch but we do have an established working from home policy so you can spend more time with your family.

Working on a real-time collaboration software is challenging - you will have to learn new technologies and prototype new apps at a speed of light, but not because it is a high-pressure environment, simply because you like to see your code working in production. That said, we don't tolerate sloppy coding - for every single line of code we write, there is almost always a line of unit-testing code.<br /><br />If you're a frontend lead right now or a driven senior engineer with a burning desire for a career progression and a skillset to match - get in touch!<br /><br />Skills &amp; Requirements<br /><br />Must have<br />* Strong experience developing web apps and mobile-first websites<br />* 5+ years experience in development using modern stacks / frameworks / technologies<br />* An expert understanding of Javascript (ES6) <br />* Experience with OO and MVC design patterns<br />* Understanding of functional programming<br />* Solid experience with React/Redux/Redux-saga<br />* Solid experience with Node.js<br />* Knowledge of when and how to apply design patterns<br />* Good grasp of functional programming and SOLID principles<br />* TDD/Unit testing<br />* Clean code is your second nature<br />* Experience with testing frameworks such as jest, mocha, chai etc...<br />* Experience developing SaaS products<br />* Previous experience of managing, mentoring and coaching teams of engineers<br />* Worked previously in an international environment<br />* Links to existing work or projects on Git<br />* Experience with AWS<br /><br />Nice to have<br />* Other programming languages (Go, Rust)<br />* Experience designing APIs from scratch<br />* Kubernetes/Docker<br />* Exposure to event-sourcing architecture<br />* Experience with CQRS",

We’re searching for an <b>Advertising Manager</b> to help our our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can <b>set your own hours</b>, <b>take holidays as you see fit</b>, <b>work remotely</b> from home, and <b>help medical research succeed</b>, then please read on. </div><div><br></div><div><span>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research. </span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Our clients</b> – medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials. </div><div><br></div><div><b>Our company</b> – Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>We’re looking for someone who can:</span></h3><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Advertise</b></span><span>—You’ll need to create, manage and optimize our Facebook advertising campaigns and funnels. This includes strategy, persona creation, and complete ownership of the landing pages and multi-page forms we use to collect patient data.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Optimize</b></span><span>—You’ll be managing our campaigns from end to end, and expected to continuously run experiments and evaluate new strategies, processes and technologies to continuously improve performance and CPA. You’ll be expected to contribute to ongoing process and systems improvement, to support reliable campaign performance forecasting, efficient campaign setup, and CPA improvement.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Learn</b></span><span>—We’re looking for someone who’s driven to constantly update their advertising and marketing knowledge with the latest strategies and techniques. In addition to developing an in-depth understanding of clinical trials you’ll need to be able to rapidly develop a thorough understanding of each of our client’s clinical trials, their concerns, and then use that knowledge to create advertising collateral. If you’re intimidated by medical jargon then you need not apply.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Collaborate</b></span><span>—We’re looking for someone who will provide leadership in our advertising process, works well with the rest of our operations team, and is not afraid of picking up the phone, calling a client, brainstorming and working towards a solution. An important part of this role is to ensure that our successful advertising campaigns are resulting in our client’s success - our advertising funnel is just the first step, and it’s critical that our clients are able to convert the patients we’re providing.</span></div><div><h3><span>What’s in it for you:</span></h3></div><div><span><b>Autonomy</b></span><span>— We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a holiday policy (you can take your holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our team is remote (we communicate via Slack and Google Hangouts). We set our own hours based on what works for us and our clients. As long as you have a good internet connection and can overlap with our clients’ working hours, you can work from wherever you choose. You will need some flexibility to overlap some of your working hours with our team and clients. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Innovation</b></span><span>— We’re the first and only company in our industry to guarantee our results. We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g., our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews) that provide predictability and certainty in a volatile industry, and we’re constantly improving our service.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We apply the same innovative approach to our patient advertising and recruitment process. We’re focused on streamlining client onboarding, client education, and gathering feedback from our clients, and we're always interested in what improvements we can gain from the latest and greatest software tools and technology.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Impact</b></span><span>— Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clients—researchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practices—work hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are the only company that solves recruitment problems in a predictable and reliable way—our consistent, results-driven process makes us the only recruitment company that provides a money-back guarantee.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Growth</b></span><span>— As a member of a small, entrepreneurial team you'll be exposed to many areas of the business. You'll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You'll be continuously testing and implementing new advertising and marketing strategies.

We’re searching for an <b>Advertising Manager</b> to help our our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can <b>set your own hours</b>, <b>take holidays as you see fit</b>, <b>work remotely</b> from home, and <b>help medical research succeed</b>, then please read on. </div><div><br></div><div><span>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research. </span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Our clients</b> – medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials. </div><div><br></div><div><b>Our company</b> – Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Advertise</b></span><span>—You’ll need to create, manage and optimize our Facebook advertising campaigns and funnels. This includes strategy, persona creation, and complete ownership of the landing pages and multi-page forms we use to collect patient data.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Optimize</b></span><span>—You’ll be managing our campaigns from end to end, and expected to continuously run experiments and evaluate new strategies, processes and technologies to continuously improve performance and CPA. You’ll be expected to contribute to ongoing process and systems improvement, to support reliable campaign performance forecasting, efficient campaign setup, and CPA improvement.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Learn</b></span><span>—We’re looking for someone who’s driven to constantly update their advertising and marketing knowledge with the latest strategies and techniques. In addition to developing an in-depth understanding of clinical trials you’ll need to be able to rapidly develop a thorough understanding of each of our client’s clinical trials, their concerns, and then use that knowledge to create advertising collateral. If you’re intimidated by medical jargon then you need not apply.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Collaborate</b></span><span>—We’re looking for someone who will provide leadership in our advertising process, works well with the rest of our operations team, and is not afraid of picking up the phone, calling a client, brainstorming and working towards a solution. An important part of this role is to ensure that our successful advertising campaigns are resulting in our client’s success - our advertising funnel is just the first step, and it’s critical that our clients are able to convert the patients we’re providing.</span></div><div></div><div><span><b>Autonomy</b></span><span>— We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a holiday policy (you can take your holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our team is remote (we communicate via Slack and Google Hangouts). We set our own hours based on what works for us and our clients. As long as you have a good internet connection and can overlap with our clients’ working hours, you can work from wherever you choose. You will need some flexibility to overlap some of your working hours with our team and clients. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Innovation</b></span><span>— We’re the first and only company in our industry to guarantee our results. We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g., our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews) that provide predictability and certainty in a volatile industry, and we’re constantly improving our service.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We apply the same innovative approach to our patient advertising and recruitment process. We’re focused on streamlining client onboarding, client education, and gathering feedback from our clients, and we're always interested in what improvements we can gain from the latest and greatest software tools and technology.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Impact</b></span><span>— Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clients—researchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practices—work hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are the only company that solves recruitment problems in a predictable and reliable way—our consistent, results-driven process makes us the only recruitment company that provides a money-back guarantee.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Growth</b></span><span>— As a member of a small, entrepreneurial team you'll be exposed to many areas of the business. You'll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You'll be continuously testing and implementing new advertising and marketing strategies. You'll have access to courses, books and training programs paid for by Trialfacts.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Opportunity</b></span><span>— We’re a rapidly growing company, 100% year-on-year via organic growth through repeat business, referrals and new clients.

    "content": "*Full Stack Software Engineer (Go/Javascript/HTML/CSS)*<br /><br />To us, being a Full Stack engineer is a mindset, you need to be competent in your core skills and excited to learn and try new things as and when you see a fit or need.  No one wants to spread themselves too thinly and that is why we have carefully selected our few core technologies but we are not afraid of trying anything new that may be right for the job.  If you agree with this then read on, it should hopefully mean that you are someone that likes to self improve.<br />This role is to be the first tech hire alongside Nub’s founder.  You will be a key hire and valued highly if you can work hard as a team towards the aims of the company.  Your judgement will be valued as we work towards engineering a unique multi-platform application with a web app based UI and a Go based back end.<br /><br />*About you:*<br />- You are a dedicated and resourceful engineer<br />- 2+ years of professional Full Stack Software Engineering Experience<br />- Proven experience of completing HTML/CSS/Javascript deliverables (web app development not brochure style websites)<br />- Competence in Go (Golang) but if you have experience delivering software with another language (such as Python) and are keen to learn Go that may work.<br />- Competence writing SQL<br />- Happy to work with Node.js, Electron, ES6, Babel, Webpack.<br />- Exposure to Vuejs or similar (e.g. react)<br />- You love staying on top of the latest developments in software development <br />- Must be authorized to work in the UK<br />- Happy to work from home but meet in London for regular meetings.<br /><br />*About Nub:*<br />Lego for written comms. Modular utility, ubiquity and unique accessibility.<br /><br />Nub makes sending beautiful and personalised emails, invoices, forms, itineraries, receipts etc as easy as building with lego.  Comprised of an engine and codeless tools to automate data capture, data manipulation and subsequent output primarily via email, pdf, print, data, or api.  Triggered by any system, language or data and achieved without the need to be a programmer.<br /><br />This kit will mean everyone can create cool customer communications on a new, automated, intuitive and scalable platform.  It will allow anyone to handle data transformation and create automated output such as print, pdf or email.  Have control over branding, designs customisation and personalisation.<br /><br />Developers will love this because it removes a complex distraction from their applications. Companies large and small will love this because it will allow custom communications from any system to their employees or clients.<br />Anyone looking to automate data transformation from one format to the other will love this because  they will find it a breeze to achieve.<br /><br />*Why work for us?*<br />Nub is a new startup, the plan is to grow and become something every developer wants to use and every company choses to use...   The CEO has a proven track record in this field and a forensic knowledge of the current technology and a clear vision of its potential. <br /><br />You’ll get to work from home and help define our culture as the company grows.  The plan is for a London office when the time is right.  The CEO has a family, likes coffee, tech, would love a dog, used to race cars and loves sport.<br /><br />You may want to exit the corporate world and enter into an exciting journey with an early stage startup.  You may be bored of coding to someone else's spec, getting stuck in meetings and not being able to be creative with your code.  Work at Nub and that will change.<br />Perhaps you are a brilliant coder looking for a great idea – this is it!",

The business strategy we have employed encourages the company to innovate in multiple areas and offers protection from competitors - *Plus we have robots!!!* <br /><br />*How far have we come?*<br /><br />We have just finished our live pilot with great success and are looking to take the platform to the next level rolling this out to more towns and cities. <br /><br />We currently have an online platform which provides consumers with an on-demand grocery delivery experience from local stores in your area, to buy your everyday necessities at the stores low prices and receive them within the hour. We also offer a merchant platform for your local shopkeeper with the ability to offer its product online with very little hassle and cost to the store, adding value and convenience to the consumer, increasing its exposure, and most importantly increase the store's revenue. <br /><br />*So where do you come in?*<br /><br />With a team of developers currently working predominantly on the back-end, we need an experienced/forward thinking designer to help give the consumers a fast and fluid UX to match our speedy delivery offering.

No, backbone.js is not this week's hottest JS framework, but that's because these apps have been used and enhanced over the last 3 years in production. They've stood the test of time. But we are using the latest tooling alongside - ES6, webpack, less, nightwatch.js etc to make development as clean as possible.</p><p>Are you passionate about efficient client-side performance and robust, scalable platforms? Do you understand the underlying principles of JS (and haven't just built a simple Angular app)? We're adding to our team to build out our Javascript clients for our API-driven microservice retail platform of 18 loosely coupled services. It’s in production, supporting multiple brands and driving millions of dollars of revenue every month from US sales.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with a globally distributed team of 65. We’re proud of the way we get great work done. Our clients love working with us and partner with us on long-term projects.</p><p><strong>What do we offer?</strong></p><ul><li>Work as part of a talented, globally distributed, successful&nbsp;team</li><li>A focussed adherence to our agile/scrum processes (we really believe it helps getting good work done)</li><li>Hard problems to solve (you won't find all the answers on Stack Overflow) - and the opportunity to own the solutions</li><li>A great working atmosphere where you can share and learn with other smart people</li><li>The best-in-class toolsets: Slack, CI/CD with Docker etc</li><li>Meetups in our Barcelona offices for our remote folks</li><li>Competitive rates</li><li>A long term working relationship</li></ul><p><strong>You'll be:</strong></p><ul><li>Building complex Javascript (mainly ES6, webpack) presentation layers to consume RESTful APIs in a performant way.</li><li>Extracting re-usable components to share across multiple SPAs</li><li>Working on ecommerce and back-office direct sales functionality to support hundreds of thousands of customers.</li><li>Helping the backend engineers in designing, specifying and implementing services to decouple functionality</li><li>Occasionally going full stack and diving in the Rails services to add a new endpoint or modify behavior (and we can help you learn here too)</li><li>Working within&nbsp;a fast moving team (working 11am - 8pm Central European time)</li><li>Identifying bottlenecks, using tools to diagnose and refactor code for scale</li><li>Ensuring the robustness, performance and failure characteristics of the system.</li><li>Writing well tested, defect free code with CI/CD</li><li>Taking ownership of production applications - managing issues, releases and ensuring quality</li></ul><p>Good English verbal and written communication skills are essential. As is production experience of React/Vue/Angular/Backbone framework applications.</p><p>This is a contract position with a long term outlook (12 months+&nbsp;full-time project) for the right candidate.

Sure, we can list the latest set of technologies that we use, but that is a given. What's more interesting is how they are used - the design, the architecture, the approach to solving business problems. And we do that across multiple clients - each and every one we're excited to work with.</p><p>Because we believe in constant learning and exploring - whether that’s a new skill, a new role, or a new way of seeing.&nbsp; And because we've found that we learn the most when we take on new challenges as a team.&nbsp; We’re proud that people love working with us (and still have lives outside of work).

Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We Practice Holacracy</strong></p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of&nbsp;<a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong>&nbsp;As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE<span>→</span></a></p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that&nbsp;<strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</p><p><strong>Design Skills We’re Looking For</strong></p><p>This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.</p><p><strong>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) design</li><li>Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles</li><li>Solid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).</li><li>Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.</li><li>History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li></ul><p><strong>Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history</strong>&nbsp;of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.</p><p>We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.</p><p><strong>Some of Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><p><strong>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills.</strong>&nbsp;We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.</p><p><strong>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire.</strong>&nbsp;We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</p><p><strong>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work.</strong>&nbsp;Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.&nbsp;<a href='https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb' rel='nofollow'>Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</a></p><p><strong>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</p><p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p><p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs' rel='nofollow'>READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p><p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p><p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p><p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Ready To Apply?</strong></p><p>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you,&nbsp;<strong>please apply</strong>.</p><p>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?</li><li>How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs? Is there anything you would add or change?</li><li>Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?</li><li>Are you familiar with Holacracy? Any questions or concerns?</li><li>What’s lacking in your current work arrangement that we could improve?</li><li>What are your philosophies on design?</li><li>What does designing great software look like?</li></ul><p>We look forward to reading your letter!</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully Remote Company!

Had enough of strict work practices, outmoded coding standards, and draconian time management? Frustrated by your daily commute, or not seeing your awesome ideas adopted? We hate these things, too.</p><p>Axsy is passionate about creating outstanding software which delights its users. We’re revolutionising the apps which are used by both large enterprises and small businesses around the world. We’ve operated as a remote-working team since we founded the company and are looking for talented&nbsp;self-starters to join us. You can work from home or a shared workspace of your choosing.&nbsp;</p><p>Our team is mainly based in the UK and we're&nbsp;ideally looking for applicants who can also work from here.&nbsp;If you need to fit work hours around other commitments,&nbsp;that’s ok, and we trust that you can manage your own&nbsp;time effectively. We&nbsp;communicate using Slack, frequent video calls, and occasional in-person&nbsp;meet-ups (3-4 times per year). We're proud of both the team we’ve created and what we’ve achieved so far. We’re punching above our weight and are expanding our team to achieve even more.</p><p>We’re still a relatively small team. We’re all good at what we do and enjoy working together. You’ll have autonomy and respect from day one. No regulations or hierarchy, just a lot of interesting and challenging work to get done. You’ll work on our React Native mobile apps, so we’re looking for people who have extensive experience of Javascript and React. If you know React but not React Native, we think you’ll pick it up pretty quickly. Knowledge of Redux, Flow, GraphQL, native modules, C++ is a bonus.</p><p>The most important skill to us is being able to pick up new concepts and technologies rapidly. Ideally, you're the sort of person who has been programming from an early age, thrives on new challenges, is passionate about technology, takes pride in finding elegant solutions to difficult problems, and has a record of open source project involvement.&nbsp;We hope to find individuals full of energy and enthusiasm, with an eye for detail &amp; good design. We’re very open to new ideas, and our most recent joiners have already introduced new tools &amp; techniques&nbsp;to the team.</p><p>Axsy is well-funded&nbsp;and has a great opportunity to grow &amp; succeed. We’re giving you the chance to be part of our success and we offer share options in addition to other benefits.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Axsy            </h2>            <div><p>Axsy&nbsp;is organised as a remote-working team. We set up the company to operate this way and it's been a big success for us so far. Thanks to modern technology, our team is able to be productive from all over the UK &amp; abroad, achieving a better work-life balance along the way.&nbsp;</p><p>We work with globally-recognised brands, delivering solutions which complement their services, and are well-positioned for future success. Our team is talented &amp; motivated, but with a relaxed &amp; friendly culture&nbsp;that welcomes new recruits.</p><p>We are an&nbsp;equal opportunity&nbsp;employer and&nbsp;value diversity&nbsp;at our company.

Do you feel at home nurturing the success of dynamic, wold class engineers? Are you a top Software Engineering Managers who want to support and lead engineers on Kibana and X-Pack, robust tools which allow visual exploration, real-time data analysis in addition to other powerful features, all while working on core frontend applications? Than we want to meet you.</p><p>If you read this far and think, “that's me!” then you probably won't need to read any further and we should have a conversation. But if you are in any doubt the type of experiences we expect you to have then the following should help clarify;</p><p><em><strong>Please include a short note as to wire you are a fit for Elastic and this role </strong></em></p><p><strong>Kibana is the window into the Stack</strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on absolutely anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong>What you will be doing:</strong></p><ul><li>Day to day management of 10-15 engineers</li><li>Hiring and recruiting of new staff</li><li>Performance management, reviews and quarterly feedback for the team</li><li>Expense management and approval</li><li>Vacation and time off management and approval</li><li>Project management and prioritization support for the team</li><li>Management of roadmaps and requirements against release targets</li></ul><p><strong>What you've done:</strong></p><ul><li>3+ years of software engineering management</li><li>Recent experience leading teams producing complex interactive web experiences</li><li>An engineering background with a B.S. or equivalent in a Software Engineering related domain</li><li>Experience leading distributed teams</li><li>Experience leading an open source product team</li><li>Familiarity with JavaScript and one or more UI framework: AngularJS, React, Node.js etc...</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Elastic            </h2>            <div><p>Elastic is the world's leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security, and analytics use cases.

While these are required as foundational languages, being the first and primary developer for the projects you will be working on, you can enjoy the flexibility of working with any framework. We’re flexible, so even if you primarily work with C# or any other languages, but have experience developing web applications, send us your CV! :)</p><p>Although based in Australia, Avant8 has presence in the US and leverages it to deal with domestic brands and investors, specializing in turning around their distressed digital assets. Our team creates innovative solutions that work well under pressure allowing for new business models to tested rapidly in any market.</p><p>We’re looking for A-players, and part of that involves autonomy. You will be assigned tasks, both small and large, and a general time frame, but given the autonomy and freedom to schedule your own daily tasks as long as you complete what needs to get done. We understand and respect that you know development better than we do and it’s not our place to call unnecessarily strict or irrational deadlines and ways of completing tasks. This may be a good place to add that you should, when applying, mention in the cover letter your favorite food and, if you’re feeling ambitious, include a picture: this is to weed out applicants who mindlessly apply en masse to listings.</p><p>Given the above mentioned autonomy and freedom, you will be expected to debrief with a daily summary of what was accomplished, problems you ran into, what’s planned for the coming days, and maybe a joke or two. :)</p><p>We are a fun, friendly, and closely knit team, and although geographically distant, we have a strong work ethos and communicate regularly allowing for a very friendly and efficient work environment. Being a part of a new division within an established company, you get the best of both worlds in terms of job security and company culture. We work hard and expect the same from all of our team members.</p><p>We work hard, but we also play hard. You should come with a great sense of humor and a smile on your face, because you’ll have a few laughs and enjoy your time working with us. We reward hard work with a variety of perks incorporated in our flexible working environment.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Avant8 Pty Ltd            </h2>            <div><p>We are Australia-based Avant8 Pty Ltd. and we are looking for a motivated full-stack developer to join a new sector in our company that focuses on building digital assets in high trafficked industries, including but not limited to medical (health, wellness), finance, and social.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote working                            </div>                    ",

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the day-to-day realities of programming.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75K-95K (Mid-Level) and $95-115K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>I know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>If you are local, we do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights. The full job description for both positions are on our website and includes salary information, videos, and instructions on applying: <a href='https://level12.io/careers/' rel='nofollow'>https://level12.io/careers/</a></p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Character First</strong></p><p>Level 12 is <a href='https://www.level12.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>founded on biblical principles</a> and has biblically informed goals. Accordingly, the reputation of Level 12 and the character of our employees is of utmost importance. You <strong>do not</strong> need to share our leadership's religious convictions, but you will need to share our commitment to the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: honest, trustworthy, reliable, ethical. We have high moral standards and we expect our employees to share those standards. If you use pirated software or media, don’t mind “tweaking” the truth, or think `porn == entertainment`, this is not the job for you!</li><li><strong>Good work ethic</strong>: you work hard and like to work hard. You also work efficiently, seeking to make the best use of your time.</li><li><strong>Dedicated</strong>: you really desire to contribute to and improve our company; you are not just earning a paycheck. You demonstrate a high level of “ownership” for and initiative with projects that are assigned to you.</li><li><strong>Teachable</strong>: you have a willingness and desire for feedback/correction. You are always looking to improve. You are willing to ask for help even if it makes you “look bad.”</li><li><strong>Resourceful</strong>: you know how to solve problems or are at least able to explain that the problem is not solvable with the requirements given. You use all resources at your disposal in an efficient manner to troubleshoot. You know when to ask someone for help and when more effort is needed on your part.</li><li><strong>Technical Prowess</strong>: you just “get” programming, computers, technology.

We’re excited to add a new Senior Full Stack Engineer to our team, but not just any engineer.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>We're looking for that someone special (yes, we're hoping that's you... keep reading to see </span><span></span><span>).</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Someone that shares our same vision. Someone that is willing to join us on our journey to change the way that businesses communicate, market, and sell online. Someone that is process-oriented and driven by seeing customers succeed.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>As a young start up (we're just coming up to our one year anniversary), we have tons of amazing users and are adding new great companies every single month.&nbsp; <b>A wonderful product experience is our primary focus here at Demio</b>... from the customer support, to the onboarding process, to the platform itself, we're working to hard to make it all a delightful experience. While the webinar, web-communication space has been around for a while and continues to grow, we believe that we’re creating an entirely new segment in the market and doing it in a simple way.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Demio is a simple but incredibly powerful webinar platform built for SaaS and Software companies</b>.&nbsp;With our platform, companies can generate leads, filter prospects, perform group demos, engaging sales presentations, integrate with their CRM, view advanced webinar reporting, track conversions, and more. It’s truly unlike any other product in the market.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Our team is small, but nimble. We love to employ great people, and we're hoping you might be the right addition to our amazing engineering team to join us on our big new initiatives and steps forward!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>However, we’re at the point now where we KNOW how pivotal it could be to find the right person to fill that role. We want someone to join our team who is hungry to make an impact, constantly striving to improve, highly responsible for their actions, focused on output and results, and understands that great companies are built one small step at a time.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>While we’re currently based in Tampa, FL, our entire team is remote, and we are happy to offer the ability to work remote with our team from&nbsp;ANYWHERE&nbsp;in the world through our systems in Slack (moving to Basecamp soon), Github, and Trello (yes, we use an Agile process). <b>We'll do everything we can to make a stress free, easy to navigate operation inside so your role is just as simple as our platform!</b></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Not only will you be remote, but we will offer a great starting salary while working with a small, agile team that is hungry and eager to make an impact. Your work will never go unnoticed. Your work will&nbsp;<b>ALWAYS</b>&nbsp;make large waves in the company.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>By joining now, you’ll be able to get in early on our company (But also the fun challenging product objectives) and help make some of the features/updates that will ultimately shape our product perfectly for our customers.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>We have a philosophy for our company that revolves around our team:&nbsp;<b>we ONLY work with A-Players</b>. A-Players, in our opinion, are people who cannot accept anything that is less than great.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>You’ll be able to work with a passionate, intelligent, and dedicated group of people that will allow you take your skills to the next level. You’ll always be challenged to be the best that you can be.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>But hey, we also like to have fun too </span><span></span><span>; we understand that building a company is quite the journey, and it can be incredibly hard, so we believe that it’s important to enjoy the moments along the way</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Skills and Requirements</b></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>What are we looking for from you? Well here’s a short list, but it will always be growing:<br></span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Developing scalable and reliable backend applications for our live webinar collaboration platform.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Excellent communication/english skills and ability to work well with remote teams (excellent verbal and written english skills)</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Follows coding best practices and develops appropriate testing and deployment scripts.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Monitors and develops standards for platform load/usage with recommendations for improving performance. (nothing is ever “perfect”)</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Takes ownership of problems and develops innovative solutions to solving them.</span></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>And the languages?&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>Well, you should have vast experience with a wide range of different programming languages, but at the same time, you should always be willing to learn &amp; grow more. Our ideal candidate has:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>At least 5 yrs of PHP experience (Phalcon PHP Framework would be plus, but not required)</span></li><li><span>At least 1 year of React.js experience</span></li><li><span>At least 5 years of JavaScript&nbsp;experience</span></li><li><span>At least 5 years of&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;experience</span></li><li><span>Experience with Amazon EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk usages is a plus</span></li><li>Have handled RESTful API connections and 3rd party API integrations via API</li><li>Working knowledge of MongoDB, and traditional SQL architectures.</li></ul><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Ok, now I know you're wondering... What's our stack built in? It’s pretty dang robust:&nbsp;</b></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><ul><li><span>Our Streaming platform is built in ReactJS, NodeJS, Socket.io, MongoDB, and WebRTC.<br></span></li><li><span>Our User platform is build in PhalconPHP, ReactJS, MySQL and a RESTful architecture.<br></span></li><li><span>Our iOS Mobile App is built in ReactNative and connects to WebRTC.&nbsp;<br></span></li></ul><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>What does the average day look like in Demio?&nbsp;Imagine this:&nbsp;</b></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Log in to our Slack (may be Basecamp soon) application when you login and high five the team already on </span><span></span><span>! Our team is all over the world, but we're always working together to innovate and move the company forward.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Review any development updates in Slack from your teammates on new code development, urgent tickets, new bug fixes, or what's new in the system for that day. Communication is always key here in a fast moving company!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Log into Trello and Github, review the sprint for that week and what the next tickets in that sprint on deck are. You can check in with our Director or Engineering to organize any priorities or make sure that your product story is being done right in regards to long-term scalability. You’ll want to commit those branches to Github and then launch them live on our Staging environment. <br></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Our QA lead can then head over and test the ticket in staging and make sure things are looking good. Move that ticket over, once approved, and we’re on to the next big win!</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>We're here to help our users as well, so that means sometimes taking a look at customer tickets coming in on priority and get those bug fixes moving quickly. Some days we’ll work on priority bugs and others on new tickets! (Most days a combination of both </span><span></span><span>.)</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>It'll be important that you keep communication with the team, QA, and support on what’s going on and where!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Then, you can high five your teammates again when you log off and update the team in Slack with your daily update!<span>&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Once a week, we'll review the sprint, goals, and any major issues plus we’ll meet month to look where to improve for better internal systems across the company. And if it’s a Friday, we might pop a few beers together (on Demio) and cheers to a great week!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>About Demio</b></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>At Demio, we are creating a culture of excitement and growth, driven by results.

So Richard set up Twickets as a service on Twitter, connecting<br />fans and allowing them to trade with each other at strictly no more than face value.<br />Today, Twickets is the largest fan-to-fan marketplace for face value tickets and connects fans<br />via both website and app (iOS and Android) across three continents.

We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything in this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!</p><p>As a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry. You will help us shape the digital guest experience for restaurant brands served by Olo. You will contribute to technology selection, architecture and user experience for our front-end applications.</p><p>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience building user interfaces that put users first and look and feel awesome to use</li><li>Deep knowledge of ES6/ES2015+ and one or more modern Javascript frameworks, with a preference for React or Ember</li><li>Demonstrable understanding of the full .NET web stack</li><li>Leadership experience that spans one or more aspects of technology selection, architecture and design oversight, and mentoring others</li><li>Superb problem solving skills with an emphasis on pragmatism, quality, and performance</li><li>Passion for learning new skills and technologies</li><li>Excellent collaboration skills</li><li>BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience</li><li>Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S.</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo reaches millions of consumers by powering mobile and online ordering for many of the country’s largest restaurant chains. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.</p><p>We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller.  We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!). Check out our culture map.</p><p>Olo is an equal opportunity employer and diversity is valued at our company. All applicants receive consideration for employment.
