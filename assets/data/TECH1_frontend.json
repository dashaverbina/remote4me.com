When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with tests and tag your team for review using video and screen-sharing as needed. We have invested heavily in local Docker development and cloud-based continuous integration and delivery so you can get setup fast and your development branch can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>You’ll work with five other full-time JavaScript / front-end engineers to maintain and improve JS / CSS standards and best practices across all of Help Scout. You’ll work with a design team with strong technical capabilities who are focused on creating scalable design systems and developing reusable interactive components across our projects. You will have the opportunity to contribute to these frameworks and other open source projects.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li><li>Since the Help Scout web app depends on PHP passthroughs between the APIs and front-end, you will have opportunities to write some PHP. Experience with PHP and/or other object-oriented languages will be necessary for you to do excellent work across our stack.</li><li>Everything is secondary to the&nbsp;<i>customer experience</i>. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability.</li><li>You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.</li><li>You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM - 6PM ET).</li></ul><div><h4>About you</h4></div><ul><li>You are experienced with modern JS development practices and frameworks including ES6 and React / Redux. You’ve worked on JS projects at scale and feel confident solving complex problems.</li><li>You are comfortable extending a large Backbone apps and have a solid understanding of the best practices.

We are pushing the envelope for what our industry has seen in regard to customer experience and service.

Your work will empower over 8,000 businesses around the world to provide great customer service, and will support other senior engineers on your team.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Tools we use</h4></div><ul><li>PHP 7.x</li><li>Lumen, Laravel, and Symfony</li><li>Backbone.js, Marionette.js, and React.js</li><li>Node.js</li><li>RabbitMQ</li><li>Redis</li><li>Pusher</li><li>Java(APIs)</li><li>MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB</li></ul><div><h4>About the role</h4></div><ul><li>The engineering team currently has thirty-four talented engineers. &nbsp;You will be working on one of the Help Scout web app teams, which currently has 6 engineers (PHP, JavaScript). On a typical day you may help a customer with an issue, work on a new feature, create a third party integration or enhance back-end tools to support our growth team. On any given project, you will be communicating with internal APIs, integrating with 3rd party services, optimizing processes using Redis, RabbitMQ, various AWS services, and wrapping it all up in support of a Backbone/Marionette or React front end.</li><li>Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/agile-remote-teams/' rel='nofollow'>remote, agile development</a>. When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with test cases and tag your team for review (often over a video and screen-sharing session).&nbsp;</li><li>We have invested heavily in local Docker development and cloud-based continuous integration and delivery so you can get setup fast and your development branch can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our top-notch in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li></ul><div><h4>About you</h4></div><ul><li>You are very experienced with modern PHP development practices and open source frameworks. You’ve worked on these sorts of projects at scale and feel confident solving complex problems. You view “best practices” as a starting point for critical thinking, rather than a dogma to follow.&nbsp;</li><li>You have created a single page application using Backbone (or a similar framework) and can write JavaScript from scratch to implement a feature. Marionette and/or React experience is a bonus, but not required. We can help you pick it up.</li><li>Your code is not only reliable and performant for customers, but can be read, maintained and understood easily by other engineers on your team. The&nbsp;<a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/' rel='nofollow'>Zen of Python</a>&nbsp;resonates with you for any language.</li><li>You believe in writing unit and integration tests and have at least tried TDD. You like owning the quality of the code you write— QA doesn’t mean throwing it over the wall for someone else to test. You understand that some things are too costly to automate and must be manually tested to get it right.&nbsp;</li><li>You take pride in your work and ownership of the solutions you build. When a team member or customer is in need, you feel a sense of urgency to understand their pain and thoughtfully help.</li><li>You are curious and constantly learning. Believing that “a rising tide lifts all ships,” you make everyone around you better sharing what you have learned and looking for ways to improve both yourself and the team. &nbsp;</li><li>You are a humble professional who wants to be challenged by the work and not the workload. You are willing to ask for help when necessary and unafraid to say “I don’t know.” At the same time, you have the confidence to take on complex and challenging problems.</li><li>You are proactive about solving problems and improving things. You take the initiative to build tools and processes that will help everyone. When working in the codebase, you leave things better than you found them.</li><li>You are an excellent communicator who can write and speak with empathy for our customers and team. You can easily communicate complex ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM- 6PM ET).</li></ul><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well. The formula we use to calculate all salaries is public to employees and is improved upon regularly.</li><li><span>Work anywhere</span>- We’ll fly you to Boston for a week of new employee on-boarding and buy your home office furniture or help you pay for a co-working space. You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM- 6PM ET).</li><li><span>Health and dental insurance</span>- We cover you and your family's health/dental insurance 100%. If you are based in the US, we'll cover you on our Aetna policy.</li><li><span>Long-term/Short-term Disability Insurance &amp; Life Insurance</span>- we cover 100% of the premiums for LT/ST Disability insurance and base Life Insurance. You also have the option to purchase supplementary life insurance through our provider.</li><li><span>International Benefit Stipend</span>- If you’re based outside the US, you’ll receive a monthly stipend that goes towards covering medical insurance, long and short-term disability, and accountant costs.</li><li><span>Flexible vacation</span>- Take time off when you need it, we trust you.</li><li><span>Paid parental leave, including adoption</span>- 12 weeks if you have or adopt a baby, 4 weeks if your partner has a baby.</li><li><span>401k with 1% match</span>- 1% Retirement Plan matching for both US and International Employees</li><li><span>Personal development stipend</span>- Up to $1,800 per year to improve your craft</li><li><span>Great tools</span>- Each employee receives a Mac laptop and 27'' display (or equivalent). We’ll also purchase any of the software or hardware you need.</li><li><span>Complete transparency</span>- Everyone has full access to business metrics and financial information about the company.</li></ul><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>About Us</span></div><div><br></div><div>Help Scout is made by roughly 70 people in 40+ cities around the world, all with a passion for excellence in their craft.</div><div><br></div><div>We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences.</div><div><br></div><div>Since launching in April of 2011, Help Scout now powers 8,000+ support teams in over 140 countries. Our&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/' rel='nofollow'>software</a>&nbsp;is used and trusted by businesses of every shape and size.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Designed to go the distance</span></div><div><br></div><div>Our mission is to foster the world’s customer-centric businesses by providing tools that serve customers in the most human, helpful way. While growth is important, team and values are paramount. We’re always striving to do impactful work we’re proud of in lieu of chasing overnight success.</div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re builders without borders</span></div><div><br></div><div>Our entire team is free to work remotely from wherever they choose. We overcome remote challenges through transparency, trust, and video conferencing. The reward is worth the effort—we’ll take talent, skill, and diverse perspectives over local geography any day.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all, we want Help Scout to be a place where passionate people can do their very best work. You won’t find any ping-pong tables or kegerators here. Instead, you’ll be surrounded by driven, supportive teammates who will push you to be better. We take work/life harmony seriously, too, as we want every career at Help Scout to be a long and satisfying one.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</span></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/diversity-inclusion/' rel='nofollow'>diversity and inclusion</a>.

Vivoom adds super-high-end branded video effects \nand assets. Consumers share broadly. Their friends and followers watch it, like \nit, and are a look-alike audience. Brands republish. It's user-generated \nadvertising that works incredibly well and everyone feels good about it. Vivoom \nwants infrastructure developers with cloud and/or video experience.\n\n\n ENVIRONMENT\n\n You'll wear lots of hats. As a startup, we believe all developers should \nunderstand operations and all &quot;ops&quot; should be software engineers. As a company, \nwe want everyone to shape our product.\n\n Vivoom is looking for experienced engineers near its Flemington, NJ and/or \nBoston, MA offices. We live with video conferencing and Slack.

From the perspective of today's consumer, if \nyour product doesn't seamlessly enable consumer sharing, it's broken. Products \nthat enable sharing are gaining market share and emerging as market leaders.\n\n Vivoom powers the always-on consumer sharing capabilities that let clients \nfurther improve the product experience for the consumer and further monetize \ntheir brand IP. Vivoom's white-labeled consumer sharing experience can be \ndropped into brand's digital or physical products and channels to provide \nseamless sharing right from the brand's products with fun branded filters for \ntheir consumers to share across any and all social and messaging platforms.\n\n Vivoom's platform provides the brand-safety and control, the republishing and \nthe analytics capabilities needed to ensure consumer created content is safe, \non-brand and delivering engagement results that dramatically outperform paid \ninterruptive ads.\n\n Vivoom is driven by highly proprietary IP and is led by executives with \nproven track records as pioneers in media, advertising, and technology.\n\n Vivoom is powering the in-product sharing capabilities for world-class \ncompanies including Microsoft, Capital One, Johnson & Johnson, Boston Celtics, \nUnivision and more.\n\n\n HOW TO APPLY\n\n Click reply and include your resume and something about yourself. \n * Principals only.

Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.</p><p><strong>Who We Need</strong></p><p>Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun. &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group. &nbsp;</li><li>Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Types of Roles</strong></p><p>We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. &nbsp;Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general &quot;gist&quot; of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast &quot;good enough&quot; approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in &quot;science experiment land&quot;</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>US Person based anywhere in the US (100% remote allowed but no off shore)</li><li>5 Years work experience as a programmer</li><li>Highly Comfortable with C# and Visual Studio</li><li>Experienced with Web Development &amp; JavaScript</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About MapLarge            </h2>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our platform powers high traffic website visualizations, data discovery, and business intelligence applications.

It doesn't need to be a something you spend more than a couple of minutes on - simply include a few sentence on why you find this position interesting, and why you think there's a good fit. we want to get an idea of how you communicate, and see you actually read the post. (We're getting a ton of applications, but sadly it seems a lot of people just hit &quot;apply&quot; even if there is no fit).</p><p>We try to be respectful of people who take the time to apply for this position, and invest just as much time as you did reviewing the post, in reviewing your application.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75K-100K (Mid-Level) and $100-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We provide a stipend to offset the cost of health insurance</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li>Telecommuting:<ul><li>Remote candidates within a 3 hour drive of Louisville, KY are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

Accordingly, the reputation of Level 12 and the character of our employees is of utmost importance. You <strong>do not</strong> need to share our leadership's religious convictions, but you will need to share our commitment to the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: honest, trustworthy, reliable, ethical. We have high moral standards and we expect our employees to share those standards.

The thought of solving a problem in an entirely new programming language, one you have never even heard of before, excites you.</li><li><strong>Technical Diversity</strong>: while we all have our preferences when it comes to programming languages or operating systems, you should be willing to work with anything, in any language, if that’s what it takes to get the job done. If you are easily lead into a “______ rocks, everything else sucks” mentality, this isn’t the job for you.</li><li><strong>Flexible</strong>: we are small, things change. You should be able to “roll with the punches.”</li><li><strong>Professional</strong>: at the end of the day, you like what you do, you take your job seriously, you do it extremely well, and you <strong>pay attention to the details</strong>!</li></ul><p><strong>Senior Developer<br></strong></p><p>The candidate for the Senior Developer position will usually have 6-10 years relevant experience and meet the following requirements:</p><ol><li>Technical Skills<ul><li>Are able to write modular, well-tested, and maintainable code</li><li>Know a software development domain really well and radiate that knowledge to our team and beyond</li><li>Are able to work on multiple projects as needed</li></ul></li><li>Leadership<ul><li>Leads the design for customer projects with feedback from other engineers</li><li>Proposes new ideas for improving the development team, customer projects, and/or our tech stack</li><li>Adheres to and promotes our <a href='https://level12.io/blog/development-mission-statement/' rel='nofollow'>development culture and mission</a></li><li>For Team Leads (see below): invests in other team members to see that they are growing as individuals and to facilitate productivity within our team.</li></ul></li><li>Code quality<ul><li>Leaves code in substantially better shape than before</li><li>Fixes bugs/regressions quickly</li><li>Monitors overall code quality/build failures</li><li>Creates tests religiously and makes sure the rest of the team is doing the same</li><li>Proactively identifies and reduces technical debt</li><li>Proactively defines and solves important architectural issues</li></ul></li><li>Communication<ul><li>Provides thorough and timely code feedback for peers</li><li>Able to communicate clearly on technical topics</li><li>Keeps issues up-to-date with progress</li><li>Helps guide other merge requests to completion</li><li>Helps with recruiting</li><li>Is able to manage conversations directly with customer contacts when needed.</li></ul></li><li>Performance &amp; Scalability<ul><li>Excellent at writing production-ready code with little assistance</li><li>Able to write complex code that can scale with a significant number of users</li><li>Avoids premature optimization</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Mid-Level Developer<br></strong></p><p>Mid-Level Developers usually have 3-6 years relevant experience and meet many but not all of the requirements listed above for the Senior position.</p><p><strong>Team Lead</strong></p><p>In addition to the leadership expectations noted above, some of our senior developers will also be involved in leading other developers and interacting with customers.

We're Scripto, the software company that The New Yorker recently called &quot;<a href='https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-scripto-the-app-that-stephen-colbert-helped-build-became-a-fixture-of-late-night-comedy-news' rel='nofollow'>a fixture of late-night comedy news</a>.&quot; It was a great start to the year, but we have even bigger plans, and we hope you'll apply to join us as a Developer. You'll be working on Showrunner, our next-generation product for screenwriters, sketch groups, sitcoms, and films.</p><p>We're looking for someone who enjoys the challenge of connecting users to APIs in an elegant and friendly way; you should be excited at the prospect of architecting and then implementing new mission-critical features that play well with our existing systems. Here's a partial list of the technologies we use every day: Choo, Nanocomponent, Codemirror, Bankai, Take-Five, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, CommonJS, and Node (6, moving to 8). You don't have to know all of those cold, even our CTO picked up (or&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/scriptoLLC/take-five' rel='nofollow'>created</a>!) some of them here at Scripto. What we'd like to see from you is 3-5 years of production JS experience, with a record of shipping software and learning on the fly. You should easily be able to point to complete projects you've devised and built, like features of a large package, or whole apps if they’re on the smaller side. Your work doesn't have to be open-source or public, but it should have real users and stakes.</p><p>We are a proudly remote company with flexible hours and health, dental, and vision benefits. We hire inclusively and value diversity. It should be noted, this position is only open to candidates in the USA. To apply, please&nbsp;submit a résumé and cover letter&nbsp;– we can't wait to hear from you.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Scripto            </h2>            <div><p>Scripto began in the early 2010s at the Colbert Report, when writer (and CEO) <a href='https://twitter.com/robdubbin' rel='nofollow'>Rob Dubbin</a> thought there&nbsp;should be a better way for the dozens of people who made&nbsp;the show every day to collaborate. It is now&nbsp;a&nbsp;thriving enterprise product whose clients have won the last&nbsp;six consecutive Emmys for <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Writing_for_a_Variety_Series' rel='nofollow'>Outstanding Writing in a Comedy/Variety Series</a>. We're a proudly&nbsp;remote company, our employees&nbsp;are leaders in their professional communities, and our&nbsp;culture emphasizes&nbsp;learning on the job and&nbsp;growing into new challenges.

Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.</p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and&nbsp;<a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement.</p><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a>&nbsp;with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel&nbsp;way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d&nbsp;<a href='https://cl.ly/2i0V3z453H2K' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use&nbsp;the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. Here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Micro-service backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a true full-stack developer that can build a features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile). Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Trajectory </strong></p><p>The main thing we care about is shipping great products that have an impact on education. But we hire for skills and attitude over experience, so we wanted to share our thoughts on <a href='https://cl.ly/0k062R1T1R3V' rel='nofollow'>the path you’ll have within Aula</a>. This framework will also form the basis of your one-on-ones. The timeline is just indicative: for experienced developers it might be much, much quicker - either way, we’ll support you to get there as fast as humanly possible.</p><p><strong>Benefits </strong></p><p>We hope you’ll join us for the mission, the work and the people. But hey… </p><p><strong> Work on hard and important problems </strong>with people who care.</p><p><strong>  &nbsp;Focus on your trajectory, not just your role. </strong>Dedicate 3 hours a week to building the skills and connections you’ll need for your dream position at Aula in 3 years.</p><p> &nbsp;<strong>Shared ownership: </strong>Joining the Aula journey means you will own part of the company.</p><p><strong> &nbsp;Learning &amp; Development stipend: </strong>Receive a small stipend for any training you would like to do in your spare time.</p><p><strong> &nbsp;Work remotely: </strong>Our developers have full flexibility to live and work wherever they please.</p><p><strong> &nbsp;Technology: </strong>Get hooked up with the technology to do your best work.</p><p> &nbsp;<strong>Free books:</strong> We’re all about books. We’ll send you as many as you can read.</p><p> &nbsp;<strong>Family Leave:</strong> If your family grows while at Aula, we recommend taking 1-3 months off - regardless of when you joined.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>You have both front-end&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;back-end experience</li><li>You have experience with React - unless you have significant Javascript experience with other libraries, so that you’ll be able to pick it up quickly</li><li>You have experience creating and iterating on products from end-to-end: we think there are certain things that freelance and agency work doesn’t teach you such working end-to-end (full feature) on an entire system.</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.</li></ul><p>We’re open to people at different experience levels as long as you feel this description captures you well.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role. Please start your application with the words ‘I breathe semicolons’ to show that you took your time to read all of this </p><p>Look forward to hearing from you,&nbsp;<br>The Aula team </p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Aula            </h2>            <div><p>Aula is a conversational platform for education.

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</a></p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

Now imagine a service where users upload entire email databases, zip files, images, hard drives of content, and pretty much anything they need to search through. Simple enough. That’s what S3 is for, right? But here’s the catch, unlike Dropbox and similar services, Logikcull’s job is to rip the data apart, analyze the hell out of it, and then organize it into logical search buckets so that legal teams around the world can easily and quickly sift through it.</div><div><br></div><div>This of course requires massive computing, massive storage, and an ever expanding infrastructure to support them all. Our challenges are a unique mix of broad and deep because the data we need to get at is always mixed up with other data. Emails have attachments, word documents wrap human-readable content in data structures and almost anything can be printed to PDF. Our system has to be smart enough to recognize everything in order to unpack it properly, graceful enough to remember complex relationships between documents and fast enough to rip through gigabytes concurrently at scale.</div><div><br></div><div>And all of this needs to happen at scale, for all of our customers (in 34 different countries and growing),&nbsp;<strong>within minutes or hours from the first upload</strong>. Insane, right?</div><div><br></div><div>It’s controlled chaos at scale and we love it. And here’s why:</div><div><br></div><div>The technical challenges are staggering. And that’s usually enough to keep a top engineer happy for quite some time. But it’s the impact Logikcull is having on our society that is even more rewarding. For instance, governments can now turn around open records requests (i.e. FOIA), within days by using Logikcull. Prior to Logikcull, this process used to take weeks, months, and, we’re not kidding, years, to complete. Blocking government information to citizens lawfully requesting that information is counter to a healthy democracy.</div><div><br></div><div>Another example where Logikcull is having an impact on our society is litigation. To us, litigation can be a means to affect positive change (<a href='http://logikcull.com/blog/into-the-wild-earthjustice-amanda-sharp/' rel='nofollow'>see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves, not a joke</a>) and it allows people of all means to get access to justice. But getting access to justice also means being able to afford litigation. And one of the biggest costs to litigation is sifting through data (i.e. discovery or e-discovery). Logikcull makes it easy, fast, and affordable for anyone to sift through data for litigation, which means that citizens and businesses can not only get access to justice, but also save a ton of money - in some cases, millions of dollars are saved by using Logikcull. For a business, the cost savings can be pumped back into the business for growth, employee benefits, and more.</div><div><br></div><div>This is why we do what we do. And the positive team-focused engineering culture at Logikcull makes working on these massive problems even more rewarding. If this is something you would like to be a part of, we’d love to hear from you.</div><div><br></div><div>Our current stack includes: Rails, Backbone + Marionette, MySQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch, all running in AWS.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Job Responsibilities</strong><br></div><ul><li>You will take ownership within our codebase, writing, maintaining clean, modular code.</li><li>You are able to take a design/proposal and carry it through to a thoughtful and polished end result with good test coverage.</li><li>You will support our amazing Customer Success team in helping diagnose/explain user-reported bugs and fix existing bugs.</li><li>You will review code written by other engineers and provide useful and honest feedback.</li><li>You will help with architecting solutions to scale our proprietary data processing platform for 10x, 100x, and beyond. &nbsp;</li><li>You will participate in on-call rotations and work effectively and collaboratively during site outages.</li></ul><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Job Requirements</strong><br></div><ul><li>You have 4+ years of experience in the Ruby language in a production environment.</li><li>You have a good understanding of highly distributed processing systems.</li><li>You are comfortable navigating through complex data structures and algorithms, and have a strong desire to produce optimal code for speed and efficiency.</li><li>You are familiar with the basics of scalable software design and architecture.</li><li>[Bonus] You have experience with Elasticsearch and/or other search technologies.</li><li>[Bonus] You have experience with MongoDB and/or other NoSQL technologies.</li><li>[Bonus] You have a solid understanding of file formats, particularly document formats, e.g. (MS Word, Excel, Outlook, Acrobat, Etc...).</li><li>You have excellent communication skills and the willingness to share your expertise.</li><li>You are pragmatic and sensible in your approach to problem solving.</li><li>You are able to think critically and gather data to constructively support your position.</li></ul><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Our Culture&nbsp;</strong><br></div><ul><li>Engineers at Logikcull are highly technical, independent, and self organized.

A typical building contains thousands of pieces of equipment, sensors, and interconnections. Gridium makes software that helps people run their buildings better, at lower cost and with less energy.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for a US-based full stack engineer to design, develop, and scale our services. At Gridium we manage quite a bit of data, pouring in daily from hundreds of thousands of electricity meters. We need help connecting new data sources and growing our web applications to support ever-greater volumes of data. That’s where you come in.</div><div><br></div><div><b>ABOUT GRIDIUM</b></div><div>--------------</div><div>Gridium is a growing, venture-backed SaaS software provider for buildings. Our products help commercial property owners manage all aspects of their buildings, from energy to work orders. We serve buildings of every shape and size, deploying a range of statistical and machine learning techniques to help develop energy efficiency strategies, streamline operations, and delight tenants.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a distributed company, so all employees work remotely.

You don’t need to be an expert in any of these; we’re more interested in your ability to solve problems effectively with whatever tools make the most sense.</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Are you comfortable working in a remote environment?<br></li><li>Are you passionate about writing testable code?<br></li><li>Do you enjoy working in all layers of a web application stack?<br></li><li>Are you a wizard at debugging services with lots of moving parts?<br></li><li>Are you familiar with Amazon cloud services?<br></li><li>Are you obsessed with data and excited about making it come alive in advanced visualization?<br></li><li>Do you love creating beautiful web applications that delight users?<br></li><li>Do you want to truly own the systems you work on?</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If so, Gridium is the place for you.</div><div><br></div><div><b>BENEFITS</b></div><div>-------</div><div>The position comes with salary, stock options, 401(k) match, a great health plan, vision, dental, generous parental leave, and a flexible vacation policy — we want you to take the time off you need so that you are happy and productive.</div><div><br></div><div><b>AND OF COURSE</b></div><div>--------------</div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Indianapolis, IN)</strong> </p><p>We’re on the hunt for an experienced Web Developer who is passionate about building fast, accessible, modular and responsive websites—whether that’s using HTML, CSS or JavaScript. We’re searching for a bright, energetic person who can work closely with our creative and development teams to bring complex websites to life—all while being mindful of the latest development trends and keeping both the client’s goals and the end user in mind.</p><p>Please note that we will consider remote applicants for this position, but you’ll get bonus points from us if you live in the Indianapolis area.</p><h2>Here’s a snapshot (but not all) of your technical responsibilities:</h2><p>We assume that a person with your experience has handled a website launch or two in your life, but just to clarify, here are some things we keep in mind when reviewing your application:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Ample experience.</strong> What does this mean? While we won’t put a requirement on the amount of years, we do want to see your portfolio of web work. We also want to know that you’re familiar with the tools and thinking we apply to our work:<ul><li>HTML, CSS and JavaScript</li><li>Front-end patterns, such as BEM, Atomic Design and object-oriented CSS</li><li>Frameworks, such as React, Vue.js and Angular</li><li>Templating tools, such as Twig and Handlebars</li><li>Module bundlers, such as Webpack, Browserify and rollup.js</li><li>LAMP-based CMS platforms, such as Craft, ExpressionEngine and Wordpress</li><li>Git and GitHub</li><li>Writing and debugging PHP</li></ul></li><li><strong>Get with the program.</strong> While our solid team of UI/UX designers design things that people will gush over, the more you have a basic understanding of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator and/or Sketch, the better. From time to time, we might ask you to provide technical insight to our web team.</li><li><strong>Nerd out with data and process.</strong> Know how to scale websites as they increase in traffic and complexity, and understand the importance of progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.</li><li><strong>Be a catalyst.</strong> Be vigilant about web standards, performance, accessibility and usability by researching and providing recommendations on services/technologies for various projects. We’ll also want you to be cognizant of site performance and speed, including best practices for reducing HTTP requests, browser repaints and mobile overhead.</li><li><strong>Juggling master.</strong> You should be able to handle multiple projects and deadlines while also being focused enough to remain committed to those that span multiple months.</li><li><strong>Stunning interactions.</strong> You should be able to show how you think in development as it relates to UI/UX. Show us what you’ve been working on!</li><li><strong>Troubleshooting skills.</strong> Yeah, we want you to be able to figure it out, whatever “it” is.</li><li><strong>Taste matters.</strong> Our clients come to us because we care about making them look amazing in their customers' eyes. Show us that you know what people like.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Start to finish.</strong> You can go from brainstorming with the team to delivering thoughtful mock-ups for all digital platforms. You can see a project through to completion, no matter what obstacles stand in your way. Stick to budget. Not only are you wise with our clients’ money, you also know how to accurately quote your work.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Don’t procrastinate.</strong> Initiate. You know how to suggest and spearhead development. Here, your ideas matter. We expect you to put them into action when you see an unfulfilled need.</li><li><strong>Play on a team.</strong> Participate in internal meetings on behalf of client accounts—and be willing to jump into the fray when help is needed. We expect you to follow our standards while working in the pipeline with other team members, including the UI/UX team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>If you have a great personality, enjoy cracking difficult problems and are an all-around team superstar, you’ll go far with our agency. If you're wondering what makes TrendyMinds a great place to work, <a href='https://trendyminds.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>check out some of the perks here</a>. Join us!</p><h2>Here’s what you’ll need:</h2><ul><li>At least three years of professional, post-collegiate experience</li><li>A B.S., B.F.A. or equivalent work experience</li><li>Must be a U.S. resident. Bonus points if you live in Indianapolis.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> New equipment, Ongoing Education, Snacks, Happy Hour, Health Insurance, 401k, Training, Swag, Bike Racks and Showers, Philanthropy, Paid Time Off, Parties, Lunch and Learns, Coffee/Tea/Soda, Flexible Schedules, Rooftop with a Grill and Outdoor Kitchen, Modern Environment</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> If this sounds like a fit for you, please send us your resume, link to your web portfolio and explain how you can contribute to our team.

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</a></p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

We believe in the transformative power of learning, and are passionate about social justice and breaking down barriers that prevent people from reaching their full potential.</p><p>We started 4 years ago with KA Lite (<a href='https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/' rel='nofollow'>https://learningequality.org/ka-lite/</a>), an offline-installable platform bundling Khan Academy content and our own student tracking tools, which is being used in nearly 200 countries and territories.</p><p>We're now in the process of releasing our second-generation platform, Kolibri (<a href='https://learningequality.org/kolibri/' rel='nofollow'>https://learningequality.org/kolibri/</a>), which empowers users to create, curate, share, and learn from diverse forms of openly licensed content, both online and offline. We're building tools for authoring videos and exercises, an app ecosystem for embedding and distributing HTML5 educational bundles, features for discovering and communicating with other devices peer-to-peer over a local network, interfaces and web-based visualizations for exploring student data, and systems for motivating, engaging, and guiding learners. On the backend, we use Python/Django, and on the frontend we use Vue.js and (in one project) Backbone.js.</p><p>We recently received significant funding from Google.org to support our work (<a href='https://www.google.org/our-work/education/learning-equality/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.google.org/our-work/education/learning-equality/</a>), and our team has doubled from 10 to 20 full-time staff in the past year. We're now building out further to support new initiatives, including a project for refugee education with UNHCR, and to continue to build towards our longer-term vision. It's an exciting period of growth, both for our team and for our impact, and there are lots of ways you could make a difference!</p><p># Who you are</p><p>You care deeply about making the world a better place, believe in the power of learning, strive to promote equality, and resonate with our statement of core values (<a href='https://learningequality.org/about/values/' rel='nofollow'>https://learningequality.org/about/values/</a>).

We seek to expand the internet's transformative power for good, to preserve and enhance its capacity to enrich and empower. We envision a world where everyone can access the internet affordably, free of interference or censorship and with full privacy.</p><p>Our goal—always—is to build tech-enhanced campaigns that resonate with millions of people, enabling them to consolidate their power and win historic changes thought to be impossible. In 2012 we organized the largest online protest in history, an internet-wide strike against web censorship which defeated the SOPA and PIPA bills. More recently, our Battle for the Net campaign drove nearly four million people to contact the FCC resulting in the game-changing passage of net neutrality rules (a “First Amendment” for the Internet). <a href='https://www.battleforthenet.com/how-we-won/' rel='nofollow'>Here’s exactly how we did it.</a> Our Reset the Net campaign organized around protecting the privacy of hundreds of million of internet users.</p><p>Our accomplishments are testament to the notion that with the right approach and creative activism, the public interest can prevail—even over some of the most entrenched political forces in the world. For more details on these and other accomplishments, <a href='http://www.fightforthefuture.org/timeline/' rel='nofollow'>check out a timeline of the events leading up to and immediately after the SOPA strike.</a></p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote positions                            </div>                            <div>                                 Full health and dental benefits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Training and mentorship from FFTF staff                            </div>                    ",

We visited cities that are buzzing with life and met people who share our passion for the web. Our mission: To <strong>get up close with the Southeast Asian web community</strong>. We wanted to learn how different local communities are compared to Europe and the US. What can we learn from them? And what feels familiar?</p><p>These two weeks were incredibly intense and jam-packed with meetups, great food, and many interesting encounters with our fellow web dev friends there. So here’s a little recap of our journey to the Southeast Asian web community and some things we learned along the way.</p><div><h5>World Wide Web, Not Wealthy Western Web</h5><p>Many of the developing economies are growing extraordinarily fast, with a rapidly expanding middle class that has increasing disposable income.

The World Economic Forum ranks Singapore on the first place of the <a href='https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/07/countries-best-prepared-for-the-new-digital-economy/' rel='nofollow'>top ten countries harnessing information technology</a>, and its government is considered to be the most tech-savvy one, too.</p>      <div>      <div>    <p><em>“You must unlearn what you have learned!”</em> Meet the <strong>brand new episode</strong> of <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/events/san-francisco-2018/' rel='nofollow'>SmashingConf San Francisco</a> with smart front-end tricks and UX techniques.

To the point where attendees sometimes have to pick between the meet-ups they want to attend because they happen to fall on the same night. However, the audience is still relatively reserved, preferring to consume knowledge over sharing their own experiences and opinions.</p><p></p><p>Companies often foster that culture, expecting employees to learn in their free-time instead of during working hours. In fact, that’s why conferences usually take place over the weekends as it proves to be very difficult for employees to get a green light during workdays. Many companies don’t provide training budgets for their employees at all, and attending conferences isn’t common. That might explain why there is only a handful of conferences taking place in Singapore, even though Singapore is recognized as the center of web development in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Approximately 50% of developers in Singapore are expats from India, Pakistan, Malaysia, European countries, and the US. Although there are startups that offer perks typical of what the western world is familiar with, such as providing complimentary food and doing team activities, a typical developer's work life in Singapore is rather tied to traditional office spaces and very long working hours, especially if they are working in agencies or corporate offices. The market itself is quite closed, and methodologies such as design sprints, iterative design and agile aren’t practiced on a day-to-day basis in those workplaces. A good ol’ hand-off of Photoshop mock-ups to front-end developers still quite a common practice.</p> <p>As we were told, there are almost no clients from overseas working with agencies in Singapore, mainly because Singapore has the same pricing level like countries in Europe or the US, so that outsourcing work to Singapore wouldn’t bring any noticeable cost advantages.</p><h4>Ho Chi Minh City: Don’t Let Limits Stop You</h4><p>Our next stop took us to Ho Chi Minh City, also informally known as Saigon. The city is, alongside Da Nang City, one of Vietnam’s tech hubs — although much smaller as what we got to know in Singapore.</p><p>Vietnam is one of the common destinations for outsourcing in Asia. Unlike in Singapore, companies often have close ties with international clients, <em>including</em> companies from Singapore.</p><p>What makes the development scene so attractive is that they don’t feel like they are on the boundaries, and are <strong>steadily pushing forward</strong>. In conversations with locals, it’s interesting to observe how the industry in Vietnam leapfrogged some technologies. Some developers writing React apps have never used jQuery, and some developers never had to deal with quirks of legacy Internet Explorer. While many websites feel remarkably slow and bloated, a good number of websites is snappy and fast, as they are heavily optimized for unstable connections in Vietnam.</p><p>Ho Chi Minh City has only a couple of small and occasional meetups, often attended by no more than 20 people. However, amongst this small community, there’s a <strong>strong sense of sharing</strong>.</p>            Developers attending the Mozilla Roadshow in Ho Chi Minh City    <p>A senior web developer in Ho Chi Minh City can make up to USD 1,000 a month, a salary which is considered a really solid income in the city (and in Vietnam). However, that doesn’t leave much budget for sending a developer to conferences and workshops in, e.g. Singapore, and developers often have to spend their free time to keep up with the newest developments.</p><p>Half of the developers we spoke to prefer to work on a freelance-base, and many developers are trying to move to Singapore as salaries are much higher there. The language barrier is quite high so that many Vietnamese developers have problems with spoken English, which doesn’t make it easier to communicate abroad. In fact, many companies who are outsourcing their work to Vietnam do employ a foreigner who acts as a mediator between clients and co-workers. </p><p>It felt that local developers take on every project coming their way, and then figure out how to get things done — learning and experimenting over nights and weekends if necessary. They take what’s out there, soaking in anything that can help them learn something new. The web industry has experienced a huge boom in the last five years, and success stories as the one of the game Flappybird which was developed by a Vietnamese developer brought a gold-rush mood also to Ho Chi Minh City.</p><h4>Penang and Kuala Lumpur: Feel The Startup Vibes</h4><p>Although George Town, the old city of Penang, Malaysia, is a mainly touristy city, it also hosts a rich startup culture with a great variety of companies. The <strong>startup scene</strong> is mainly driven by locals, and the Malaysian government has launched a couple of programs to support startups throughout the country. The local startup scene in Penang is being complemented by a few expats from Europe and the US who have chosen Penang as their home base to work with clients from overseas. Not only is Penang an affordable city to live in, but also because English is a commonly spoken and written language in Malaysia, so that communication is not a problem for foreigners.</p><p>The Malaysian government also has introduced PHP as a mandatory part of training at many high schools. Getting started with PHP and Wordpress hence is the main entry point for developers to become a full-stack developer and do pretty much anything from Wordpress templates and a bit of design work to deploys, backend optimization, and SEO.</p><p>Many developers also have already experimented with service workers and CSS Grid layout, and they try to keep track of what’s going on in React community as well as what they need to know in the wide field of web performance.</p><p>Also noticeable is that the Penang community is making efforts to support women getting started with their own businesses. The startup hub and <a href='http://acatpenang.com/coworking-space/' rel='nofollow'>co-working space @CAT</a>, for instance, has a dedicated space for female founders.</p><h4>Hong Kong: Think Big</h4><p>Hong Kong greeted us with its bustling city life where modern skyscrapers and blinking neon signs meet narrow streets which have conserved their unique character from earlier days. Being a major international financial center, it’s not surprising that many developers work in the <strong>financial industry</strong> — for big banks like Credit Suisse, HSBC, or Merril Lynch, and others. Many of them are expats from Europe, particularly the UK, but also from Japan. Some of these banks host huge development departments — having more than 200 people working in a department isn’t unusual.</p><p>Sure thing, Hong Kong is thinking big, but there are also a lot of small design agencies based there. But since designing websites is often just one part of the design work they do, agencies tend to work with freelance web developers quite often. One thing of the trends we’ve seen in other Southeast Asian countries seemed to be really strong in HongKong: not only do web developers earn much more than designers; they also seem to have a much better reputation and place in the society.</p><p>Hongkong’s meetups culture is mainly driven by expeats, and they gain a lot of attendance and interest from local designers and developers. Some meetups such as <a href='https://www.meetup.com/HarbourFrontHK/' rel='nofollow'>Harbour Front</a> are inviting the big names if they happen to be in town. While meetups normally consist of various speakers giving a short talk, the Harbour Front meetup is hosting only one speaker at a time, and the meetup sessions often evolve into interactive sessions rather than being just “talks.”</p>      <div>      <div>        <p>          Is your pattern library up to date today? <em>Alla Kholmatova</em> has just finished a fully fledged book on <strong>Design Systems</strong> and how to get them right.

But even when we’re stuck in our routines and deeply rooted in our local communities, we should remember to <strong>take a look around</strong> every once in a while. Nothing could be more inspiring as seeing how others work on that big playground that the web is. After all, we all share a common goal, no matter where in the world we might be coding, prototyping, designing and tinkering: to make the web a little better place every day.</p><p><em>Thanks to <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/cosima-mielke/' rel='nofollow'>Cosima Mielke</a> for helping to prepare this article.</em></p></div><div>    <span>(cm, vf, il)</span></div>            </div>        </div>                 <div>            <div>                                                </div>        </div>                    <div></div>                </div>     <div>        <div>            <div>    <h5>Browse All Smashing Magazine Topics</h5>    <ul>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Accessibility</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Android</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Animation</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Apps</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>CSS</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Design</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Design Patterns</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Design Systems</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>E-Commerce</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Freebies</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Graphics</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>HTML</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Illustrator</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Inspiration</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>iOS</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>JavaScript</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Mobile</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Pattern Libraries</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Performance</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Photoshop</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Plugins</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>React</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Responsive Web Design</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Service Workers</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Sketch</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Typography</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>UI</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Usability</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>User Experience</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Wallpapers</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Web Design</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>WordPress</a>        </li>              <li>            <a rel='nofollow'>Workflow</a>        </li>          </ul></div>        </div>        <div>            <div>                <p>With a commitment to quality content for the design community.</p>                <p>Founded by Vitaly Friedman and Sven Lennartz. <span>2006–2018</span>.</p>                <p>Smashing is proudly running on <a href='http://www.netlify.com/?utm_source=smashing&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=footer' rel='nofollow'>Netlify</a>.</p>                <p>Fonts by <a href='http://latinotype.com/' rel='nofollow'>Latinotype</a>.</p>            </div>            <ul>                <li>✎ <a rel='nofollow'>Write for us</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>Contact us</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>About us (Impressum)</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>Privacy policy</a></li>                <li><a rel='nofollow'>Membership login</a></li>                <li><a href='mailto:markus.seyfferth@smashingmagazine.com?subject=Let’s talk about advertising' rel='nofollow'>Advertise</a></li>            </ul>        </div>    </div>    <div>    <a title=&quot;Back to top&quot; rel='nofollow'>                    Back to top                                    </a></div>    <div></div>  <div></div>                  ",

We are open to the right candidate even if you are remote. If you are remote and believe you are the right person for the job - send us some code, change our mind!</p><p><strong>The Traits Our Backend Developers Have</strong></p><ol><li>Fluent in Django/Python.</li><li>Passion for front end development. In some cases this is mobile app development, in other cases, it's integration with other products that need to consume our APIs, or web development with AngularJS. This helps build better backends when you are the consumer.</li><li>Possess strongly held beliefs and aren't afraid to voice them. Opinions are usually based on something very specific related either to past experiences or to the platform, and very rarely theoretical.</li><li>At least one specific area of excellence in the skills mentioned below - you know this cold!</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions. Exceptions aren't the norm.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills You'll Need </strong></p><ol><li>Python/Django - We use lots of it.&nbsp;</li><li>Docker, AWS - specifically the following services - ECS, S3, SQS.</li><li>PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana - Core of the platform.</li><li>RabbitMQ, Terraform and other ancillary services that we offer.</li><li>Front End - Pick one: React Native, Angular, Swift, Android.</li></ol><p><strong>The Interview Process </strong></p><ol><li>If you like what you've heard so far and want to come work for us, please send us your resume along with some code samples!</li><li>Give us three (3) days to review and respond. We'll try to respond to everyone who appears to be a good fit.</li><li>A hands-on coding challenge.</li><li>A 60-minute technical conversation about the coding challenge and your resume.</li><li>An in-person interview at our offices.</li><li>A finalized job offer.</li></ol>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Advanced Threat Analytics, Inc.            </h2>            <div><p>Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) is helping MSSPs (Managed Security Service Providers) and enterprises finally break free of “alert tyranny” – a state when the volume of security alerts grows so out of control – it dictates staffing levels and operational business models. Traditional SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and incident orchestration solutions try to address the issue by reducing the time it takes to investigate each incident. They do not address the volume issue. ATA takes a different approach – we attack the problem by dramatically slashing the total number of incidents you need to investigate – freeing you from alert overload. This enables you to take a more efficient, effective, and strategic approach to security operations.</p><p><strong>Why Us?</strong></p><ol><li>We are incredibly fast-paced. You must be able to get on board with our pace.</li><li>We turn on a dime - something that sounds like a good idea today, doesn't mean it is - we are fine with that. We like to experiment.</li><li>We are growing at 150% YOY, which means a lot more demands from customers - we like to delight them all!</li><li>Equity and work culture is fantastic! We love what we do and it shows in our work.</li><li>Reasonable work/life balance barring bursts which are exceptions.
