We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia.

Developers in this team will focus on writing logic for various backend components related to the cryptocurrency realm. Core Data uses a 24/7 development model where projects are actively worked on in shifts in a continuous cycle, and thus positions are available for qualified applicants in all time zones. Candidates selected for this position will work under a full-time independent contractor relationship with our EU-based division.&nbsp; While efforts are made to ensure the most comfortable work schedule for each candidate possible, many candidates will be asked to work&nbsp;a Tuesday through Saturday or a Wednesday through Sunday schedule (8 hours per day, 5 days per week).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of product lines which applicants may work on include: a from-scratch cryptocurrency exchange, a cryptocurrency mining pool, and creation of an entirely new cryptocurrency which provides new features not currently satisfied by existing tokens.</p><p>For this position, emphasis is placed on the applicant's ability to produce solutions with minimal outside help. As this is a senior-level position, all applicants are expected to be able to write the required applications from start to finish, including design of any database queries or tables. Design specifications will be provided for each project prior to commencement. While actual programming ability is one of the key requirements of this position, applicants for this senior-level posting are expected to show initiative and take a practical approach towards solving real-world problems.</p><p><strong>Examples of technologies we commonly use:</strong></p><ul><li>C++14</li><li>MongoDB</li><li>ZeroMQ and RabbitMQ</li><li>NodeJS</li><li>Boost</li><li>WebSockets</li></ul><p>Applicants with work experience in one or more of the following areas will be given priority:</p><ul><li>Any type of programming work on cryptocurrencies or blockchain</li><li>Network programming (TCP and/or UDP)</li><li>Low latency messaging systems</li><li>Messaging queues</li><li>Creation of an interpreted or scripting language</li><li>Experience with MongoDB (time-series data experience a plus)</li></ul><p><strong>As a pre-screening question, please explain in your cover letter / email</strong>&nbsp;what the 'virtual' keyword does in C++ and what the difference would be if a class function/method is declared with and without it.
