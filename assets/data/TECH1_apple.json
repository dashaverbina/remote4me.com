We do this by keeping the Wikimedia projects fast, secure, and available to all, protecting the values and policies that allow free knowledge projects like Wikipedia to thrive, building new features and tools to make it easy to read, edit, and share from the Wikimedia sites, and by supporting the communities of volunteers who make the projects possible.</p><p>At the Foundation, we build technology to help people everywhere access Wikipedia, across devices and in nearly 300 languages. We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia. Roughly a quarter of our budget goes to supporting the community that make the site possible, including through&nbsp;grantmaking programs&nbsp;that enable volunteers and enrich the information on the sites.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage people with a diverse range of backgrounds to apply.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully paid premiums for medical, dental &amp; vision insurance premiums                            </div>                            <div>                                 401(k) with 4% matching contribution                            </div>                            <div>                                 7-12 weeks parental leave with 100% pay + lactation room                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wellness Program ($1800 annual) to promote wellness &amp; personal growth                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pre-tax savings plans for Transportation &amp; Parking                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible work schedules and remote working options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pet Friendly office                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commitment to diversity &amp; inclusion throughout the employee lifecycle                            </div>                            <div>                                 12 days vacation, 19 days holiday, 2 days volunteer work and more!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Lean more at https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Work_with_us                            </div>                    ",

Developers in this team will focus on writing logic for various backend components related to the cryptocurrency realm. Core Data uses a 24/7 development model where projects are actively worked on in shifts in a continuous cycle, and thus positions are available for qualified applicants in all time zones. Candidates selected for this position will work under a full-time independent contractor relationship with our EU-based division.&nbsp; While efforts are made to ensure the most comfortable work schedule for each candidate possible, many candidates will be asked to work&nbsp;a Tuesday through Saturday or a Wednesday through Sunday schedule (8 hours per day, 5 days per week).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of product lines which applicants may work on include: a from-scratch cryptocurrency exchange, a cryptocurrency mining pool, and creation of an entirely new cryptocurrency which provides new features not currently satisfied by existing tokens.</p><p>For this position, emphasis is placed on the applicant's ability to produce solutions with minimal outside help. As this is a senior-level position, all applicants are expected to be able to write the required applications from start to finish, including design of any database queries or tables. Design specifications will be provided for each project prior to commencement. While actual programming ability is one of the key requirements of this position, applicants for this senior-level posting are expected to show initiative and take a practical approach towards solving real-world problems.</p><p><strong>Examples of technologies we commonly use:</strong></p><ul><li>C++14</li><li>MongoDB</li><li>ZeroMQ and RabbitMQ</li><li>NodeJS</li><li>Boost</li><li>WebSockets</li></ul><p>Applicants with work experience in one or more of the following areas will be given priority:</p><ul><li>Any type of programming work on cryptocurrencies or blockchain</li><li>Network programming (TCP and/or UDP)</li><li>Low latency messaging systems</li><li>Messaging queues</li><li>Creation of an interpreted or scripting language</li><li>Experience with MongoDB (time-series data experience a plus)</li></ul><p><strong>As a pre-screening question, please explain in your cover letter / email</strong>&nbsp;what the 'virtual' keyword does in C++ and what the difference would be if a class function/method is declared with and without it.

Our vision is to decentralize banking and bring the power of financial services to everyone in the world, including the nearly 2 billion adults that to this day remain unbanked.</p><p><strong>iOS at Bread</strong></p><p>Bread started out on iOS so the Apple ecosystem is in our blood. Originally, our entire Bitcoin stack was written from scratch in Objective-C. We've since evolved our business and product significantly, however iOS remains core to our ability to execute on our vision. We're not a mobile-first company, we're mobile-only. Our mobile apps are the only way our customers interact with Bread, so we take great pride in our apps.</p><p>The Bread app on iOS is responsible for securing billions of USD worth of digital assets, and that number continues to grow every day. We're growing our iOS team so we can expand our product portfolio and support our rapidly growing iOS customer base.</p><p><strong>What we're doing at Bread</strong></p><p>Bread is at the heart of a financial revolution. We're building the missing piece of infrastructure that ties together the essential functionality of a bank, but where individuals retain complete control over their assets. As a a financial infrastructure company, our mission is unlikely to ever be complete. We need continually strive to bring the power of our apps to new regions of the world, some of which have never had wide access to banking functionality.</p><p>Our approach to this problem heavily focuses on several core tenants. For one, we will never have direct control or visibility over customer funds. It is not our job to interfere in the personal financial lives of our customers. This is accomplished by using digital assets like Bitcoin, and a mobile app like ours which manages its assets on-device.</p><p>The second tenant of our approach is to provide integration with the traditional financial system. Regardless of the currency, people still need to get paid, pay their bills, pay for goods at merchants, and send money to their family and friends. We are building infrastructure that integrates with local financial businesses that tie in with local currencies and adhere to local laws.</p><p>Finally, we need to fight for a quality consumer experience. This is why we try to retain control over every moment of our customer's interaction with our products. We relentlessly design, redesign, test, and experiment to ensure our customers have a positive, safe experience.</p><p><strong>What it's like to work here</strong></p><p>We've built a lively remote work culture that emphasizes regular personal interaction. At Bread, we started as a remote team and have built our workflows around it. This allows us to hire people who want to work with us, regardless of where they've decided to settle (or roam). </p><p>Work-life balance is important to everyone at Bread, and we strive to ensure everyone has enough time for family, exercise, and mental health. In our opinion, a happy and healthy team is an essential ingredient to finding creative solutions to the hard problems we're trying to solve.</p><p>We're more operationally transparent than you may be used to. The entire Bread team has access to a variety of dashboards that help our distributed team make better decisions. If you have a question that can't be answered by a dashboard or an easy query, let's see if we can fix that.</p><p>Bread is committed to building an actively inclusive work environment that makes our team an excellent home for everyone—regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, race, education, age, or other personal characteristics.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p>There are no hard requirements, so if you see something listed here that you're unsure about, please don't hesitate to ask!</p><ul><li>5+ years of software engineering experience</li><li>Confidence working in the iOS ecosystem: Xcode, debugging</li><li>Some experience with Swift</li><li>Ability to write unit tests, integration tests</li><li>Knowledge of web technologies: APIs, HTTP, JSON, etc</li><li>A desire to learn and grow your skills</li><li>You value your attention to detail</li></ul><p>Nice to haves:</p><ul><li>Experience with C and embedded development is a big plus</li><li>Crypto currency experience will help you get up to speed quicker</li><li>Graphics programming and animations</li></ul><p>You should include these in your application:</p><ul><li>Resume and LinkedIn profile</li><li>Links to code samples on Github, Gitlab, etc</li></ul></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere*</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>USA/Canada/Mexico</p></dd>        </dl>",
