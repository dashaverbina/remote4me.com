    "content": "About TINT:<br />TINT’s vision is to help brands humanize their marketing across their customer journey. Why? Because traditional brand marketing is not working effectively anymore. Consumers are constantly bombarded with unengaging and irrelevant ads on the daily, leading to ads being blocked and trust diminishing.<br /><br />To solve this, our belief is that a brand’s customers are often its best marketers, and the explosion of social media sharing on smartphones has substantially scaled word of mouth marketing for organizations.<br /><br />TINT’s software platform empowers B2C marketers to find, curate, and display their most effective customer-generated content from social media onto their websites, digital screens, emails, social ads, and jumbotrons. That way they can increase engagement and trust with consumers, which leads to increasing marketing performance and decreasing content creation costs.<br /><br />Our company is a 4.5 year, profitable, bootstrapped startup with 30 team members headquartered in San Francisco with a distributed team across the globe (US, London, Dubai, India, Canada, Brazil). Our team has overcome many odds, including achieving profitability within 5 months of launch, growing to $1m ARR within 1 year, scaling to over $6m in revenue/year without VC funding, and served over 5000+ clients across 172 countries.<br /><br />Many of our employees joined and continually grow with TINT due to our radically transparent and fair culture. We believe that everyone at TINT deserves the opportunity to reach their potential, and TINT is a perfect vehicle to do so.
