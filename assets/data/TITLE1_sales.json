Our useful funding products, which we believe will change the landscape of Government funding allows us to network with people at the forefront of software technology in the UK. We're excited to start our hunt for the talent who will grow and maintain our network of satisfied partners.<br /><br />Are you the self-motivated, entrepreneurial Partnerships Manager we're looking for?<br /><br />GrantTree was founded 7 years ago and employs 33 people. In our self-managing culture everyone has the freedom, power and trust to do great work. We call this open culture. It’s been successful for us so far, a rewarding and somewhat unusual working experience for self-motivated individuals (we suggest you check out our GlassDoor reviews). This is the ideal environment for creative, independent people who are open to developing through challenging work.<br /><br />Our Sales team is...<br /><br />High-reaching.<br />Brilliant at conversion.<br />Formed of talented individuals each with their own creative way of building effective relationships.<br /><br />Could you see yourself in this team?<br /><br />A significant amount of GrantTree's success is a direct result from collaboration with our partners. We work with fantastic organisations and it's important to us to continue to strengthen our relationships with each of our existing and newly on-boarded partners.<br /><br />You will work closely with the Partnership Director as a member of the wider Sales team to implement new partnership plans and to grow the deal flow from our existing Partnership base. Drawing on your prior Business Development experience you'll capitalise on your expert relationship building techniques to thrive within the Partnership space.<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />- You have professional experience in independent lead generation (within software/tech would be a plus).<br />- You're confident negotiating contracts and closing new business where necessary.<br />- You know how to generate and manage pipelines.<br />- You have the ability to implement partnership delivery plans.<br />- You enjoy working towards targets.<br />- Running workshops, roundtables, existing delivery plans and attending events are key activities for you.<br />- You're innovative, and think creatively about how to add further value to partnerships.<br />- You pride yourself on your brilliant communications skills.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />We believe that people should be rewarded fairly for the work they do. At GrantTree there is no secrecy over salaries and the way we work them out. For this role, this is likely to lie between £28k-£35k depending on experience. We don't have a commission structure here, and ask you to consider, &quot;is important to you?&quot;<br /><br />While we understand an environment without commission won't work for everyone, if you join our team at GrantTree you can enjoy the unlimited access to paid training we offer, access to health insurance, our cycle to work scheme, and an annual discretionary bonus which all contribute to the overall package.<br /><br />Aside from money, we offer a place where you can be yourself. We want you to develop your skills and fulfil your potential. We have a flexible approach to working, and some of our staff work remotely most of the time. Our office near Old Street is bright and airy, with a fab roof terrace. You can take up to 6 weeks as holiday each year.<br /><br />Equal Opportunities<br /><br />Teams are stronger when they have a diverse range of people. Applications are accepted from everyone, regardless of the categories they put themselves in. We also encourage talented ‘square pegs’, who don’t neatly fit into the person specification, to apply.<br /><br />How to Apply<br /><br />Please use the email address provided and let us know you saw this job on &quot;Work in Startups&quot;.",

    "content": "About TINT:<br />TINT’s vision is to help brands humanize their marketing across their customer journey. Why? Because traditional brand marketing is not working effectively anymore. Consumers are constantly bombarded with unengaging and irrelevant ads on the daily, leading to ads being blocked and trust diminishing.<br /><br />To solve this, our belief is that a brand’s customers are often its best marketers, and the explosion of social media sharing on smartphones has substantially scaled word of mouth marketing for organizations.<br /><br />TINT’s software platform empowers B2C marketers to find, curate, and display their most effective customer-generated content from social media onto their websites, digital screens, emails, social ads, and jumbotrons. That way they can increase engagement and trust with consumers, which leads to increasing marketing performance and decreasing content creation costs.<br /><br />Our company is a 4.5 year, profitable, bootstrapped startup with 30 team members headquartered in San Francisco with a distributed team across the globe (US, London, Dubai, India, Canada, Brazil). Our team has overcome many odds, including achieving profitability within 5 months of launch, growing to $1m ARR within 1 year, scaling to over $6m in revenue/year without VC funding, and served over 5000+ clients across 172 countries.<br /><br />Many of our employees joined and continually grow with TINT due to our radically transparent and fair culture.
