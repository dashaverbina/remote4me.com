This is currently built mainly from Terraform, Puppet, AWS and Ruby.</p><p><strong>Teams</strong></p><p>Our <em>Platform Engineering</em> team works on ReadyScale, adding features, fixing bugs, and deploying it to our customers.</p><p>Our <em>Customer Engineering</em> team supports and maintains deployed ReadyScale platforms for our customers, rolling out security patches and deploying platform improvements as well as keeping on top of support queries.</p><p>We're hiring for both teams right now, and if you're not sure where you'd fit best, that's fine -&nbsp;we rotate people through the teams from time to time. Everyone takes part in the out-of-hours on call rota, even the directors!</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Attitude, flexibility, and the ability to learn new technologies quickly, are all more important than years of experience.

As dictated by client requirements, we work with a number of different language environments&nbsp;and application frameworks. We even have one customer still running COBOL.</p><p>Honestly, if you're not sure if you have the relevant experience for this job, get in touch anyway and we'll figure it out together.</p><p><strong>Other</strong></p><p>The salary range listed here is indicative - we'll make you an offer based on your location and experience.</p><p>We're not looking to work with&nbsp;recruiters&nbsp;to fill this role.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About The Scale Factory            </h2>            <div><p>The Scale Factory is a growing London-based consultancy.

That said, client visits (mostly London, but sometimes further afield) will occasionally be necessary, and some client engagements will influence the hours you'll need to be available - but most are pretty flexible around this too.</p><p>As well as monthly co-working days (one in London, one in Manchester), we bring the whole team together every couple of months for planning sessions, hack days, and socialising. We try to ensure that our social time is balanced and inclusive: we'll sometimes play board games in the office instead of just defaulting to&nbsp;a visit to the pub (though we do that from time to time too!)</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 25 days holiday per year                            </div>                            <div>                                 High spec Macbook or Thinkpad                            </div>                            <div>                                 Budget for conference attendance (incl. international travel)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Culture of inclusivity                            </div>                            <div>                                 Group life protection &amp; critical illness cover scheme                            </div>                            <div>                                 Mixture of on-site and remote work                            </div>                            <div>                                 Friendly colleagues, with a wealth of experience to share                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible working hours to suit you                            </div>                            <div>                                 Training and development opportunities                            </div>                    ",

This role is responsible for Fastly’s overall hardware architecture vision, strategy, and roadmap. As Director of Hardware Systems Engineering you will be required to recruit, hire, and retain a top notch, globally distributed team of infrastructure architects and test/lab engineers. Expect that your team will be presented with unreleased hardware for testing, evaluation, and integration into our stack. Know in advance that there will be many unknowns, most often a lack of documentation and drivers, but that is OK because such situations excite you. In this role, you will be expected to latch onto complex problems and drive the team towards success.</p><p>Your team of architects are people who are comfortable laying out a datacenter, building up rack elevations, and know the three-phase power equation. They are comfortable picking the right Intel Scalable Xeon Processor to replace the current line of E5-2697v4s in use today. And they will ruthlessly reason about DIMM power density and heat output versus cooling fan velocity. They will aggressively complain about poor driver implementations and then make suggestions on how to improve them. They will debate the merits of using CDWM passive multiplexing systems for short haul 10GE extensions over the aggregation services into 100GE circuits because colored lasers are neat.</p><p>You are responsible for organizing cross functional hardware projects at Fastly because we all know high performing hardware needs deep software integration. You’ll integrate with leaders in our kernel, driver, and caching teams to help ensure efficient use of our hardware. As Director you will bring harmony to the chaos of the hardware supply chain. You’ll work to ensure seamless technical integrations with Fastly’s stack while ensuring upstream availability of goods from manufacturers. You should have a mind for the business details so that you know when you are paying too much for NAND.</p><p><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><ul><li>Recruits, retains, and manages globally distributed infrastructure architects and hardware systems engineers.</li><li>Develops and iterates on system hardware strategies to optimize for performance and cost.</li><li>Engages with key supply chain partners to understand roadmaps, future product release, and long term strategic benefits to Fastly.</li><li>Works with business functions (finance, legal, and compliance) to ensure objectives on budget, risk, and compliance are adhered to and met.</li></ul><p><strong>PRIOR EXPERIENCE</strong></p><ul><li>Prior leadership experience in engineering, systems, and/or IT.</li><li>5+ years of direct experience designing large server environments.</li></ul><p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>B.S. level credentials in Engineering and/or Computer Science.</li><li>Must be a capable leader with experience in running distributed teams.</li><li>Must be a strong communicator, verbally and in documentation.</li><li>Capable of designing metrics, iterating on measurement, and driving change.</li><li>Comfortable with Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, bonus for any of SQL, R, Python.</li></ul><p><em>Fastly provides equal employment opportunity without regard to an applicant’s race, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, medical condition, religion, marital status or veteran status.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Applicants with disabilities may be entitled to reasonable accommodation under the terms of the Americans with Disabilities Act and certain state or local laws.

The web service is not part of our &quot;core product&quot; and thus has lower uptime requirements.</li></ul><p><br>See <strong><a href='https://goo.gl/cDUirr' rel='nofollow'>https://goo.gl/cDUirr</a></strong>&nbsp;and <strong><a href='https://goo.gl/XDpmBi' rel='nofollow'>https://goo.gl/XDpmBi</a></strong>&nbsp;for a taster on the lengths we go to at each layer in the stack to ensure 100% service uptime.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Day to day you can expect to be working on:</strong></p><ul><li>Writing Ruby code for our infrastructure automation, orchestration, configuration and continuous integration testing of our infrastructure.</li><li>Writing Go code for our core routing, workers and infrastructure services.</li><li>Making extensive use of a wide range of AWS services. Whilst we primarily use AWS for our infrastructure, in time we expect that to change as we span other cloud services.</li><li>Managing and developing out our continuous integration services that test every aspect of the service, from infrastructure tools, to our health servers, routers, realtime services, protocol adaptors and client libraries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our CI environment is mature, yet we would like to continue to evolve our CI environments to help improve the robustness of the platform and reduce risk of regressions.</li><li>Being exposed to our other development environments such as Node.js and Elixir, both used extensively in our realtime services.</li><li>Working with the realtime engineering team to ensure our infrastructure supports the ever changing networking, security and processing requirements.</li><li>Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.</li><li>Diagnosing and fixing bugs in all areas of our platform. &nbsp;You will often be working at very low levels in the network stack to help diagnose difficult to identify distributed problems.</li><li>Work with the engineering team to enable them to take responsibility for the complete lifecycle of the features and code they deliver i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments. We are strong believers in all developers being responsible for deploying their own code.</li><li>Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products. &nbsp;All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.</li><li>Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.</li><li>Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.</li><li>Suggestions for new features or improvements to <strong><a href='https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/' rel='nofollow'>our protocol and API specifications</a></strong>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;<br><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Salary range: €40k to €85k.</li><li>Employee options: Yes, negotiable.</li><li>Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays.</li><li>This role can be remote or on-site in our London office. However, if you are working remotely, you will need to be in a European timezone so that we can communicate effectively during business hours, and you will need to be close enough to visit our office in London occasionally. &nbsp;Our preference is to have a team member near enough to commute to our London office when necessary. You will benefit from a flexible working environment in which working from home and managing your own working hours sensibly is the norm.&nbsp;</li><li>Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about.&nbsp;</li><li>Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.</li><li>Work with genuinely nice and smart people who care about code quality and enjoying their jobs.</li></ul><p><br><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience: A minimum of a three years of professional experience with Go as Go is used in all our routing and infrastructure services.&nbsp; Our infrastructure automation and orchestration layer requires you to be proficient in Ruby. You should have experience using both statically and dynamically typed languages. Experience with Node.js and Elixir/Erlang is beneficial. You must have solid experience managing infrastructure and CI environments, and any distributed or large scale infrastructure management is preferred. <strong><a href='https://blog.ably.io/what-is-a-distributed-systems-engineer-f6c1d921acf8' rel='nofollow'>Understanding of distributed systems</a></strong>&nbsp;is beneficial.</li><li>Pragmatic: A problem solver excited by the prospect of automating your job away and working autonomously to solve problems and bring solutions to the team.</li><li>Fast Learner: We’re looking for software engineers who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies. &nbsp;Our stack is diverse, and we expect it to continue to grow.</li><li>Testing: Experience using testing frameworks and adoption of test driven development where applicable.</li><li>Communication: We use tools such as Slack throughout the day to communicate, however we believe in voice conversations to discuss and solve problems.

The calibre of the code we produce is what excites us each day and motivates us each. &nbsp;If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably. &nbsp;Our team is made up of a strong remote contingent, however our base is in London and growing. We are strong believers in face-to-face communication where possible. Whilst this is a remote working role, being able to practically travel to London occasionally is highly preferable and working on a similar time zone is a must.</p><p>Day to day you can expect to be working on:</p><ul><li>  The &quot;core&quot; realtime platform which is largely Node.js and Go. You will also be required to work on the various services and routing layers of the platform which are built in Go and Elixir (we would expect you to be comfortable in either Go or Elixir, both would be a big win). As an aside, we use Ruby for all infrastructure automation and orchestration and occasionally write lower-level native code where necessary (such as native modules for Node). We're always revisiting the technologies we use and are always open to using new technologies where suitable.</li><li>  Working within the realtime platform and solving distributed programming problems.</li><li>  Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.</li><li>  Diagnosing and fixing bugs in our platform using distributed tracing techniques.</li><li>  Adding suitable test coverage to new features as well as existing functionality, conducting load tests using our frameworks, and generally helping to address platform stability and regression prevention.</li><li>  Be responsible for the complete lifecycle of your features and code i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments with ownership of any issues that arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are strong believers in all developers being involved in the system operations as well.</li><li>  Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products. &nbsp;All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.</li><li>  Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.</li><li>  Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.</li><li>  Suggestions for new features or improvements to&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/' rel='nofollow'>our protocol and API specifications</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>  Salary range:&nbsp;€40k to €85k. Depends entirely on skills and experience.</li><li>  Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays. Can be negotiated.</li><li>  Benefit from a truly flexible working environment in which remote working and managing your own working time is the norm.</li><li>  Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about.&nbsp;</li><li>  Skills development is intrinsic in the job.

Go and/or Elixir experience is very beneficial. You must have experience using both statically and dynamically typed languages, ideally in at least one other language. Any exposure to realtime and distributed systems is a real advantage. An understanding of Ruby is beneficial in regards to infrastructure automation and tooling, but not necessary.</li><li>  Pragmatic: A problem solver excited by the prospect of working autonomously solve problems and bring solutions to the team.</li><li>  Fast Learner: We're looking for software engineers who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies. &nbsp;Our stack is diverse, and we expect it to continue to grow.</li><li>  Testing: Experience using testing frameworks and adoption of test driven development where applicable.</li><li>  Infrastructure: Experience with infrastructure and distributed systems is beneficial.</li><li>  Communication: We use tools such as Slack throughout the day to communicate, however we believe in voice conversations to discuss and solve problems. You must be proficient in spoken and written English, be eager to collaborate with the engineering team and constructively welcome code reviews.</li><li>  Customers: Comfortable talking to customers and assisting them with their technical issues and integration.</li><li>  Open source:&nbsp;We prefer developers who have contributed back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small.</li></ul><h4>****** NO AGENCIES PLEASE ******</h4></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United Kingdom</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>EU only, preferred in the UK</p></dd>        </dl>",
