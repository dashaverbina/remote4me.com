    "title": "Infrastructure Engineer at Geckoboard",
    "content": "As a Geckoboard Infrastructure Engineer, you will be on the team who are continually improving our infrastructure and software systems. As we continue to grow, the projects you work on and changes you make will enable Geckoboard and the team to deliver better products to market and improve the way we work. In short, you’ll make the working lives of our customers and colleagues easier.<br /><br />Based from our London office, you'll be joining a friendly team with brilliant people in an environment with empowered engineers, flexible working conditions, and a focus on skill development (see &quot;Life at Geckoboard&quot;).<br /><br />Our Infrastructure Engineers:<br />- Enjoy thinking about how systems work, how they scale, and how they fail.<br />- Break down large pieces of work into smaller pieces that can be shipped separately.<br />- Write code in a high-level programming language (e.g. Go, Ruby, Python).<br />- Enjoy helping their colleagues and end-users, and when designing solutions always consider their needs.<br />- Are comfortable using a Linux shell.<br /> <br /><br />Projects our Infrastructure Engineers work on:<br />Our system handles thousands of requests per second, so the work we do has a tangible impact on the reliability and performance of our application, and the experiences our customers have using Geckoboard. We also recognise that our customers are trusting us with some of their most sensitive data, so we constantly work to ensure the security of that data. Some of the work we’ve done in the past few months:<br /><br />- Built a CI pipeline to test our Chef configuration against EC2 spot instances on every commit.<br />- Put our deployment tooling behind an API.<br />- Made it possible for anybody at Geckoboard to easily QA a pull request of our front-end app on our production site.<br />- Implemented distributed request tracing to help Engineers visualise calls between our microservices.<br /><br />You might find yourself working on some of these projects:<br /><br />- Migrating the services we run on AWS EC2 Classic to VPC. We’d like you to look at our systems holistically and help us re-design and improve them in the process.<br />- Helping our engineers understand what their apps are doing in production through implementation of better instrumentation, metrics, monitoring and visualisation.<br />- Increasing the frequency and velocity of our deployments. Our engineers currently deploy to production 12 times a day, but we believe we can make it easier.<br />- You'll also be regularly involved in planning, prioritisation and evaluation of our work; your experience and suggestions will help drive the projects we work on.<br /> <br />Day to day you can expect to be exposed to, and work with technologies including: Chef Solo, Test Kitchen, Terraform, Vagrant, Consul, HashiCorp’s Vault, AWS, Librato, Lightstep.<br /><br />We're not expecting that you’ll have worked in all of these areas before. More than anything, we value people who are passionate about picking up new skills and sharing what they’ve learned with the rest of the team and a diversity of backgrounds.<br /><br />Right now you may be in a similar role, or perhaps you’ve worked as a Software Engineer for a few years and would like to move into operations/managing infrastructure. Our first Infrastructure Engineer started at Geckoboard as a Software Engineer. You may even be in an operations role and are looking to have a broader and long-lasting company impact.<br /><br />If you’ve managed applications running in a “production” environment, preferably using a configuration management tool (e.g. Puppet, Ansible, Chef), we’d love to hear from you.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Life at Geckoboard<br /><br />We’re constantly striving to ensure that we offer the most encouraging, inclusive, and efficient environment possible.<br /><br />We don't just pay lip service to work-life balance, we actively and strongly encourage it.

Whilst we primarily use AWS for our infrastructure, in time we expect that to change as we span other cloud services.</li><li>Managing and developing out our continuous integration services that test every aspect of the service, from infrastructure tools, to our health servers, routers, realtime services, protocol adaptors and client libraries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our CI environment is mature, yet we would like to continue to evolve our CI environments to help improve the robustness of the platform and reduce risk of regressions.</li><li>Being exposed to our other development environments such as Node.js and Elixir, both used extensively in our realtime services.</li><li>Working with the realtime engineering team to ensure our infrastructure supports the ever changing networking, security and processing requirements.</li><li>Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.</li><li>Diagnosing and fixing bugs in all areas of our platform. &nbsp;You will often be working at very low levels in the network stack to help diagnose difficult to identify distributed problems.</li><li>Work with the engineering team to enable them to take responsibility for the complete lifecycle of the features and code they deliver i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments. We are strong believers in all developers being responsible for deploying their own code.</li><li>Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products. &nbsp;All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.</li><li>Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.</li><li>Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.</li><li>Suggestions for new features or improvements to <strong><a href='https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/' rel='nofollow'>our protocol and API specifications</a></strong>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;<br><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Salary range: €40k to €85k.</li><li>Employee options: Yes, negotiable.</li><li>Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays.</li><li>This role can be remote or on-site in our London office. However, if you are working remotely, you will need to be in a European timezone so that we can communicate effectively during business hours, and you will need to be close enough to visit our office in London occasionally. &nbsp;Our preference is to have a team member near enough to commute to our London office when necessary. You will benefit from a flexible working environment in which working from home and managing your own working hours sensibly is the norm.&nbsp;</li><li>Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about.&nbsp;</li><li>Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.</li><li>Work with genuinely nice and smart people who care about code quality and enjoying their jobs.</li></ul><p><br><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience: A minimum of a three years of professional experience with Go as Go is used in all our routing and infrastructure services.&nbsp; Our infrastructure automation and orchestration layer requires you to be proficient in Ruby. You should have experience using both statically and dynamically typed languages. Experience with Node.js and Elixir/Erlang is beneficial. You must have solid experience managing infrastructure and CI environments, and any distributed or large scale infrastructure management is preferred. <strong><a href='https://blog.ably.io/what-is-a-distributed-systems-engineer-f6c1d921acf8' rel='nofollow'>Understanding of distributed systems</a></strong>&nbsp;is beneficial.</li><li>Pragmatic: A problem solver excited by the prospect of automating your job away and working autonomously to solve problems and bring solutions to the team.</li><li>Fast Learner: We’re looking for software engineers who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies. &nbsp;Our stack is diverse, and we expect it to continue to grow.</li><li>Testing: Experience using testing frameworks and adoption of test driven development where applicable.</li><li>Communication: We use tools such as Slack throughout the day to communicate, however we believe in voice conversations to discuss and solve problems. You must be proficient in spoken and written English, be eager to collaborate with the engineering team and constructively welcome code reviews.</li><li>Customers: Comfortable talking to customers and assisting them with their technical issues and integration.</li><li>Open source:&nbsp;We prefer developers who have contributed back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Are you up for the challenge?</strong><br>Apply now via the <strong><a href='https://ltpx.nl/DY67OuB' rel='nofollow'>application form</a></strong>.

Ones which are live rather than static, where data is in motion rather than at rest.\\Things like live chat, realtime location tracking, live document collaboration, gaming and elearning. One of our customers even uses Ably for their air traffic control system for drones.\\Working at Ably means you are working on a cutting-edge truly distributed product that is helping build the future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What we can offer you -- in brief</strong></p><p>You will learn with the best. You will have autonomy and freedom to experiment and improve. You will be part of a dynamic team and a business that is taking off. &nbsp;We have just&nbsp;<a href='http://www.eu-startups.com/2017/07/london-based-ably-raises-1-million-to-deliver-next-generation-realtime-digital-experiences/' rel='nofollow'>completed a $1m financing round to fuel our growth</a>. We have the best technology, and the&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ably.io/about/team' rel='nofollow'>best people</a>&nbsp;in the industry. &nbsp;</p><p>Join us now and you'll be early in at a business going places, you'll learn a lot, you'll work with the founding team, and you'll have fun.\\<strong>What we want in return -- in brief</strong>\\We want someone smart, ambitious, curious and motivated. Someone is prepared to do their best and work their arse off to do great work and become outstanding at what they do.</p><p><strong>Job description</strong></p><p>You'll be working with a deeply technical engineering team who collectively bring a wealth of experience and broad technology skills. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites us each day and motivates us each. &nbsp;If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably. &nbsp;Our team is made up of a strong remote contingent, however our base is in London and growing. We are strong believers in face-to-face communication where possible. Whilst this is a remote working role, being able to practically travel to London occasionally is highly preferable and working on a similar time zone is a must.</p><p>Day to day you can expect to be working on:</p><ul><li>  The &quot;core&quot; realtime platform which is largely Node.js and Go.
