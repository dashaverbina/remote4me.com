We are looking for folks with a background in systems administration, operations engineering, and who enjoy building and operating production infrastructure.This could be the right opportunity for you if you want to help design, build, and operate the services that are at the core of how Travis CI runs continuous integration and deployment services for our many thousands of open source and commercial users.As an infrastructure operations engineer, you will be responsible for building scalable, testable, and repeatable infrastructure through automation. YouÃ¢Â Â ll help us with the infrastructure components and services that can be relied on and scale to running hundreds of thousands of CI jobs. YouÃ¢Â Â ll participate in a 24x7 on-call rotation that is composed of folks from across all of TravisÃ¢Â Â s engineering teams.You should be proficient with written and asynchronous communication, and value building working relationships with Builders in remote locations. You have an excellent track record of writing and maintaining great documentation.You value and are comfortable with contributing to open source software as part of your day to day work.You will be part of an environment that is spread across time zones and where communication happens primarily using text and video chat. We value empathy and clear communication, and the importance of building a diverse and vibrant workplace.You can expect to help us continue growing our engineering and people culture in a way thatÃ¢Â Â s healthy and vibrant.----__REQUIREMENTS__Desired Skills &amp; ExperienceThe requirements and experience below outlines what we need to help us manage and grow our production build infrastructure. Ideally youÃ¢Â Â ll have experience with several of these, but more important than the specific technologies, languages, and tools is that youÃ¢Â Â re interested in helping us in building our culture. While we donÃ¢Â Â t apply DevOps as a label to any particular team or area of our week, we do feel our engineering and operations embody the things that DevOps represents. We emphasise shared trust and responsibility, building automated and repeatable processes, continuous learning and improvement, blameless incident handling and postmortems, a strong belief in people over technology, empathy, and infrastructure as code.* You should be familiar with the practices and principles of building modern distributed software systems.* You are comfortable with creating automation tooling.* You have a background and interest in working with Ruby or Go.* You have experience designing, building, and operating production infrastructure that often combines both hosted and in-house services.* YouÃ¢Â Â re comfortable discussing the tradeoffs of building vs buying with regard to things like monitoring, metrics, logging, compute resources, etc.* You have built and maintained production systems running on cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services, VMware, or Google Cloud Platform. ItÃ¢Â Â s more important to us that you have an understanding of how and where these kinds of services are used than requiring you to have deep knowledge of them.* You have a good understanding of containerization tools like Docker, the benefits and tradeoffs of using them, and you are interested in implementing and operating infrastructure that incorporates them.* You have experience with Chef, Puppet, Ansible, or other modern configuration management tooling.* You are familiar with Terraform, Packer, or other tools that support the values of infrastructure as code.* You have experience with automating one or more cloud platforms through their APIs and SDKs. Familiarity with the vSphere API and SDK is a huge bonus.* You have a demonstrated desire and ability to learn.Tools and Technologies We UseWe have a pretty diverse set of technologies that make up our stack.

The role deserves a bright individual with a spark of creative problem solving, paired with a sensible approach to risk.<br /><br /><br />New Challenges<br />Recently funded, we’re now in a position to launch a range of new products; this is a significant task that requires a re-think of some key architectural decisions we made in our live platform. You’ll be working closely with the CEO and CTO to figure this out and launch a solution by the Autumn.<br /><br />We are constantly striving to improve Popsa, from UX, to customer support, to platform architecture, so to help us improve even faster, we have set a goal to migrate from our existing large APIs written using Laravel framework (PHP) towards HTTP micro services and server-less functions (AWS Lambda) in Node.js – you’ll take charge of this effort.<br /><br />Popsa runs entirely on Amazon AWS services, so please only apply if you’re familiar with EC2, Simple Queue Service, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB and API Gateway.<br /><br />We’re also looking for someone who is up for a challenge, there’s a lot of responsibility here, and we want someone who pushes themselves to constantly improve. Do you have pet projects? Contribute to open-source communities? Are you a regular at AWS Summit? You could be the right person for the job.<br /><br /> <br />Education & Experience<br />Education is everything, but we recognise there are many ways to get it.

We don’t discrimnate on education, it’s the results that matter.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Expertise<br />    RESTful APIs – you’ll be designing and building new APIs for our mobile and web clients, and integrating with new partners and suppliers<br />    PHP and Laravel – a large chunk of our platform is built with these technologies<br />    Object-oriented JavaScript and Node.js — this is where we’re headed<br />    Structuring code for scalability and performance<br />    AWS Services – EC2, AutoScaling, RDS, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, CodeDeploy, VPC, CloudFront, Route53, CloudWatch, SQS, SNS, SES<br />    SQL – writing queries should be second nature<br />    Package managers, like Composer and NPM<br />    Testing frameworks<br />    Git – we’re big on branching workflows, pull requests and code reviews<br />    Automated Code Deployment – with tools like Jenkins or AWS CodeDeploy<br />    Terminal – your shell choice says a lot about you<br />    Professional IDEs like PHPStorm or WebStorm<br />    Linux – you should be very comfortable with Unix-style operating systems<br /><br />If you have a few years of commercial experience under your belt (freelance or employed) that’s a definite bonus. Make sure you tell us about it when you apply.<br /><br />Ideally<br />    Documenting code and processes comes easy to you<br />    You have a working knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3<br />    Together we will evangelise the benefits of automated workflows<br /><br /> Expectations<br />    We’re a close and hard-working team; happy to share workloads and work late at crunch time, you’ll need to be a team-player.<br />    We’re sticklers for neat, maintainable, well-documented code that follows the conventions for the language or framework you’re working with. We’ll expect you to feel the same way.<br />    We work in an Agile team with quick iterations, regular deployments, weekly sprints; it helps if you’ve experienced these working patterns.<br />    We’re driving towards increased automation so we expect everyone to contribute to this DevOps culture with high-visibility of application performance.<br />    You’ll be responsible for API development (architecture, programming, testing, documentation, and deployment), internal apps (such as our bespoke PDF generators and our customer support CMS) and platform stability/security (ensuring Popsa stays up and running whilst protecting our customer’s data).<br /><br />Rewards<br />You’ll receive a competitive salary, but most importantly, you will also get to own part of the business.<br />Popsa has an share options scheme that is open to all employees.<br />We’ll tell you all about it as part of the interview process.",
