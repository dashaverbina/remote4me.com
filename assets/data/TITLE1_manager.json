Personal career journeys are firmly aligned to the corporate roadmap. Big company ambitions with a small company feel. Consultants are fiercely loyal to the company and this is borne out by a very low attrition rate.<br /><br />*WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THE ROLE?*<br /><br />In many ways you will feel like your own boss. You will need to be independent, flexible and able to travel extensively throughout Europe and across the globe. The role will bring lots of autonomy including a significant opportunity for remote working.<br /><br />*WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES?*<br /><br />If you enjoy the formal structure of a corporate environment then this is not for you. You will need be self-motivated and versatile enough to wear multiple hats i.e. consultant, project manager, business analyst, technician, mentor, adviser. You will have a network of consultants to support you in the early days but thereafter you will be expected to stand on your own two feet.<br /><br />*WHAT'S MY BACKGROUND?*<br /><br />You come from a technical hands-on development (.NET, Java, C# or similar) environment and be looking to move (or have recently moved) into a more strategic, consultative, client-facing role such as business analysis or project management.<br /><br />*PROGRESSION?*<br /><br />This is a fantastic opportunity to be part of an exciting success story and to grow with a company that has world-class ambitions. In many ways progression will be what you make it.<br /><br />*WHAT ARE THE NUMBERS?*<br /><br />Up to EUR 85,000 + excellent benefits + share options.",

As the market leader for field service supply chain solutions in the UK, we rely on our software team to innovate and build new solutions, as well as developing our existing systems, keeping ByBox ahead of the competition and reinforcing our position as a successful innovator within UK field support.</p><p>We are also successfully re-positioning ourselves as a global technology provider for locker delivery solutions, predominantly focussing on the field service supply chain. This is an exciting departure from the previous market position as a distribution company with a strong technology capability. This change of position is allowing us to operate a different revenue model, through software subscriptions and licensing, rather than through logistics services.</p><p>To support this, the software development department must deliver the correct short and long-term projects to enable that re-positioning.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>As a Software Development Manager at ByBox your duties include:</p><p>Leadership. Lead, motivate and influence a team of expert software developers to deliver value for ByBox while ensuring software quality. Ensure the developers have all the tools they need, be it hardware, software, or training, to do their job to the required level.</p><p>Relationships. Work closely with colleagues in the software development department to ensure the development team are aligned to business priorities and strategy. Develop strong relationships with internal customers to understand their perspectives and to positively influence the reputation of software development.</p><p>Recruitment. Take a highly pro-active role in the recruitment of software developers. Work with the ByBox recruitment team to ensure the highest-quality candidates are identified and engaged effectively. Also, engage with external organisations to seek the right talent and to promote ByBox as a forward-thinking employer of software developers.</p><p>Resourcing. Work closely with the Business Interface Manager and Project Managers to ensure the right developers are available at the right time for delivering the Software Development Pipeline. Where necessary, own the relationship with outsourced-development teams and the process for bringing on additional software developers on a temporary-contract basis. Ensure the software developers are appropriately assigned to projects, and given opportunities to work on other projects as required and fairly. Respond to business needs through the appropriate deployment of developers, while protecting long-term contingency in capacity so we can quickly respond to opportunities.</p><p>People development. Develop and retain our people by fostering a positive environment for personal and professional development through continuously engaging with developers, appraisals, objectives and training plans. Provide a platform for developers to raise concerns or offer new ideas, support one another, and resolve conflict, and where necessary manage performance or disciplinary concerns. Promote and develop the key values from our Ways of Working, including innovation, trust and openness.</p><p>Continuous improvement. Drive continuous improvement and adoption of best practices within the software development team to optimize the performance of the team. By pragmatically weighing the business need for delivery with the need to keeping technology current, help to ensure the team is producing the right solution at the right time.</p><p>Documentation. Define and own the good practice for technical documentation, demos, and handovers amongst the team for the benefit of colleagues, and customers requiring technical API documentation.</p><p>Technology. Support your team in ensuring they are abreast of the latest developments in technologies, and they have the tools they need to adopt appropriate technology. Be familiar with the current technologies in your team, and be aware of upcoming technologies. You do not need to be the technology expert within your team, but must be able to articulate the pros and cons of competing technologies and justify investment to senior management.</p><p>Quality Assurance. Work very closely with the Quality Assurance Manager to ensure QA practices are aligned across the department, particularly in the adoption of Test Automation and the Test Automation Engineers reporting to the QA Manager.</p><p>Workload. Manage your own objectives and priorities effectively and without close supervision. Although you won't be directly managing the work of your direct reports (this will be done by Software Project Managers), a good awareness of their current work will be crucial in making good decisions. You will be able to escalate issues to the Head of R&amp;D and will also be required to make recommendations. You will also be involved in the technology strategy by supporting the Head of R&amp;D with departmental planning activities as required.</p><p><strong>The Person</strong></p><p>The Software Development manager does not need to be currently active in writing code, and the role does not entail any code-writing, but there is room for a successful candidate to define the level of their technical involvement, based on their knowledge. The ideal candidate will:</p><ul><li>Have a passion for Technology and good understanding of trends in Software Development.</li><li>Have a strong technical foundation in Software Development.</li><li>Embrace a cross-functional approach to team management and appreciate the challenges therein.</li><li>Foster an open, collaborative environment, and balance people's needs with company objectives.</li><li>Appreciate the challenges of managing a team of home-workers, and home-working yourself.</li><li>Understand how to lead and manage a team of highly talented, distributed Software Developers.</li></ul><p><strong>Essential qualifications and experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Team Leadership or Management, particularly teams of Software Developers</li><li>Technical background.</li><li>Worked with home-working or distributed teams.</li><li>Management of outsourced development partners.</li><li>Excellent command of written and spoken English.</li></ul><p><strong>Desirable qualifications and experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience working in a team of primarily .Net &amp; JavaScript developers.</li><li>Experience in the logistics industry.</li><li>Knowledge of the ByBox domain</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About ByBox            </h2>            <div><p>ByBox is leading the way in box-based logistics.

For the same reason, we have a very sales-oriented culture.

Do you feel at home nurturing the success of dynamic, wold class engineers? Are you a top Software Engineering Managers who want to support and lead engineers on Kibana and X-Pack, robust tools which allow visual exploration, real-time data analysis in addition to other powerful features, all while working on core frontend applications? Than we want to meet you.</p><p>If you read this far and think, “that's me!” then you probably won't need to read any further and we should have a conversation. But if you are in any doubt the type of experiences we expect you to have then the following should help clarify;</p><p><em><strong>Please include a short note as to wire you are a fit for Elastic and this role </strong></em></p><p><strong>Kibana is the window into the Stack</strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on absolutely anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong>What you will be doing:</strong></p><ul><li>Day to day management of 10-15 engineers</li><li>Hiring and recruiting of new staff</li><li>Performance management, reviews and quarterly feedback for the team</li><li>Expense management and approval</li><li>Vacation and time off management and approval</li><li>Project management and prioritization support for the team</li><li>Management of roadmaps and requirements against release targets</li></ul><p><strong>What you've done:</strong></p><ul><li>3+ years of software engineering management</li><li>Recent experience leading teams producing complex interactive web experiences</li><li>An engineering background with a B.S. or equivalent in a Software Engineering related domain</li><li>Experience leading distributed teams</li><li>Experience leading an open source product team</li><li>Familiarity with JavaScript and one or more UI framework: AngularJS, React, Node.js etc...</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Elastic            </h2>            <div><p>Elastic is the world's leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security, and analytics use cases.
