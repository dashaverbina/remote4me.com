We're creating protocols to allow buyers and sellers of fractional usage assets and services (think Airbnb, Getaround, Fiverr, Taskrabbit) to transact without paying middlemen 20-30%. We're excited by the opportunity to build censorship resistant marketplaces and redistribute value to the contributors to the network instead of just the founders and VCs. We believe the open source protocols we're developing could ultimately replace dozens of existing multimillion or multibillion dollar businesses.<p>We're experienced founders who have built and sold multiple businesses in the past. Origin is the most ambitious idea we've tackled to date (hopefully on the right side of crazy). We currently have a working MVP built on Ethereum and IPFS. We're looking for all sorts of people to join our team, whether you code in react, python or solidity. We're a distributed team and open to remote.</p><p>Ping us at founders@originprotocol.com if you're interested.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

You love coaching people to do their best, seeing people’s strengths and talents and drawing it out of them even more. You naturally pick up on subtle team dynamics and are able to proactively jump in to assuage a concern or just offer a few words of encouragement. <br><br><strong>You are an incredible problem solver</strong> — you are strategic, clever, and quick on your feet. You’ll be the go-to person when we’re trying to figure out a sticky issue. &nbsp; <br><br><strong>You are extremely resourceful and great at playing detective</strong> — you can unravel any problem and figure out what’s really going on, what the missing pieces are, and go out and find them. &nbsp; <br><br><strong>You do NOT thrive on being micromanaged</strong> and love to be given the freedom to excel in your job. Being your own boss within an organization is a dream come true for you. &nbsp; <br><br><strong>You are open, direct, and straightforward.</strong> You believe that honesty, awareness, and ownership are the direct routes to problem solving. You’d rather not play the “blame game,” but instead just correct the issue and keep moving! You are a solution-based thinker who investigates why things went wrong with the goal of improving the process. You believe that a process problem lies at the root of every apparent people problem. &nbsp; <br><br>It is pretty impossible to faze you and you’re able to take a hit and keep rolling — your goal is to get it done, even if the path that gets there isn’t quite the one that you anticipated! &nbsp; <br><br><strong><strong>-----</strong>About This Role</strong> <strong>-----</strong><br><br>You will be the overall marketing project manager at Thrive Marketing®. What does this mean? That you’ll be grand central station for all of our projects. You’ll break down our goals into deliverables, hand them off to the right people, then make sure everything is on track and getting done on time. You’re the go-to person for questions, resources, or whatever our team needs to get the job done. You are excellent at translating big ideas into projects, from figuring out the master plan to figuring out exactly which details need to be executed when. <br><br>You’ll also be our “virtual office manager,” doing HR types of tasks like paying vendors, signing off on time sheets, and interfacing with our CEO to keep tabs on project budgets. <br><br>Basically, you are the one who keeps our virtual office humming every day. You keep our team happy and our projects on time. <br><br><strong>We are a virtual office</strong>— that means everyone (including you!) works from your own home office. This means you get all the best parts of interacting with a super fun team, with none of the commute and cubicles! Although your day to day will involve working closely with our small team, you need to be the kind of person that enjoys working from home and managing their own time.&nbsp;Some of your tasks will include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>translating big ideas into projects, deliverables, &amp; timelines</li><li>working with everyone on our team to determine their top 3 monthly goals, then tracking progress/success on those goals</li><li>monitoring our task management system actively look for roadblocks and making sure everything is progressing</li><li>overseeing all of our sites and working with our team to make sure they’re up to date</li><li>overseeing course content creation — working with our team to break down the course, put together the materials, &amp; make it live and functionalfor customers</li><li>facilitating weekly &amp; daily team meetings</li></ul><p><strong>This is a 40/hr week remote contract position. You’ll be working independently from your own home. &nbsp; <br><br>-----About Our Company-----</strong>&nbsp; <br><br>Founded in 2004, Thrive Marketing® is an award-winning, full-service digital marketing agency, specializing in marketing automation and building highly converting websites and sales funnels. &nbsp; <br><br>Thrive Marketing’s mission is to make an epic difference in the world by enabling our clients to serve as many people as possible – by promoting their life-changing services and products to the masses.

Recent, hands-on experience coding both server side (C#) and client side (JavaScript) are strongly suggested, and 5+ years work experience as a professional programmer is required. &nbsp;</li><li><strong>Experience Wireframing UI &amp; Designing APIs -</strong> You do not have to have strong artistic skills, but you should be comfortable not only spec-ing out UI wireframes but also designing the supporting technical web service API’s and/or client side component API’s.</li><li><strong>Technical Project Management</strong>: &nbsp;You should be highly organized with a strong history in either technical project management or as the lead developer for complex software development projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Customer Facing</strong>: comfortable meeting with sophisticated customers and managing expectations on large high value projects.</li></ol>                    </div>                            <h2>                About MapLarge            </h2>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make&nbsp;the world safer, more productive, and more efficient.&nbsp; The MapLarge API provides real time geospatial and predictive analytics for over 15 billion location events per day and trillions of historical events.

Our mission is to use these solutions to power the emerging economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, security and infrastructure, and more. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us. Our Enterprise team is responsible for solution development and delivery for corporate clients and has led some of the most innovative production blockchain implementations in the world.</p><p>The Role<br>The business development manager is a consultative sales role at ConsenSys and will be working directly with the Enterprise team in a revenue-generating role, as well as representing broader ConsenSys products to prospective clients. This person will own all business development outcomes. We are looking for a variety of candidates and have needs for flavors of this role, some more partner-relationship centric and some more direct-client centric. We are specifically looking for business development managers to support our partnership activities (primarily cloud providers and solution integrators), financial services efforts (New York and London) and industrial/corporate sales.</p><p>Our business development managers lead technical and delivery teams through complex sales processes: requirements gathering, solution architecture, product and competitive positioning, partner enablement, proposal generation and drafting appropriately scoped statements of work. You could be onstage at a conference one day, working on a client proposal the next, and delivering partner training the following week, all while collaborating with our product teams on feature roadmaps, token launches or marketing roadshows.</p><p>A great candidate for this position will be confident when entering a board room setting and skilled at leading and supporting complex conversations with ease. This person will have a minimum of 3 - 5 years of experience working with with senior level business executives and technologists through enterprise software sales cycles, notably with experience in emerging technology ecosystems. If you worked in a sales, business development or channel management role at a leading big data, machine learning, or PaaS company for the past few years, you may well have the type of background we are looking for. A similar background at a leading systems integrator or in solutions delivery is also relevant. You need to be comfortable being held accountable to client-based outcomes and ultimately revenue performance.</p><p>It’s important to us that you have a clear enthusiasm and aptitude for learning about new industries, technologies, and how they fit together. Bonus points if you have previous experience in FinTech and/or have a deep understanding of the blockchain / Ethereum ecosystem.</p><p>This role does not come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at ConsenSys, to evolve as our organization evolves. What does that mean for you? We think that means you will have an opportunity to create an exciting role with plenty of growth potential over time.</p><p>When we interview you, we will be looking for people with high levels of emotional intelligence who are also intellectually curious, always professional, dynamic in conversation, charismatic, and persuasive. You must be able to ask specific yet articulate questions, quickly synthesize insights from patterns in conversation, and reflect back the key points from a conversation in order to get alignment, commitments, and lay out next steps.</p><p>From a tactical standpoint, you are highly effective at leading discovery meetings, taking thorough notes, continuously qualifying opportunities in or out of the pipeline, designing and presenting bespoke sales proposals to key stakeholders, and overcoming challenges and objections to get to commitments. You must take a hands on approach throughout the contract / negotiation phase to ensure all stakeholders sign off on the engagement with agreeable terms. Last but not least, we expect the business development manager to complete a successful project handover to the delivery team assigned to the project and maintain the client relationship through the delivery phase.</p><p>If you are ready to take the leap in joining a fast growing company in a business development capacity, we encourage you to apply today!</p><p>Ability to travel 30-50+% required. Varies by location and team.</p></div>",
