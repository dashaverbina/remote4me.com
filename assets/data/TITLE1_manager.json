Head office in Camden, London<br /><br />One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Business* *Development* *Manager*.<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />This is a New Business Sales focused role. Due to expansion and success, the Switchee sales division has created a new role of Business Development Manager. The successful applicant will have an interest in the smart technology space and some experience of selling to the social housing market. The key activities to be undertaken by the successful candidate:<br /><br /><br /><br />* To generate profitable sales revenues through selling<br />* Switchee Smart Thermostats to Social Housing Providers<br />* To generate commercial interest in the Switchee product through promotion at exhibitions, trade shows, social media etc.<br />* To promote Switchee and the brand through all external communications<br />* To be the first port of call for incoming sales enquiries<br />* To update and track sales opportunities through our CRM system<br />* To liaise with Switchee internal departments to maximise sales opportunities e.g. Marketing<br />* To report sales leads/wins/losses/pipeline, hit unit sales targets and perform against department KPI’s<br />* To proactively look for business development opportunities through networking<br />* To actively seek and report back customer requirements and feedback<br />* To participate in team working to benefit the wider company goals, outside of your strict job description<br /><br />We are a company built on a strong technical foundation. You’ll need to grasp and communicate a technical solution with clients. We also expect you to work closely with Product Development to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre.<br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />* 3yrs+ sales/account management experience<br />* Sales experience selling to Social Housing Providers (Housing Associations and Local Authorities)<br />* Ideally sold to Dir and Exec Dir level within asset management, sustainability, repairs, IT/digital<br />* Desire to work in a small, fast paced and exciting company within the emerging IoT space<br />* Some experience in the ventilation, heating controls, asset management software markets would be beneficial but not essential<br />* Bachelor’s degree from a top university<br />* Proven ability to develop and implement effective marketing strategies<br />* Strong analytical & numeracy skills with complete command of Excel<br />* Research skills to identify new potential customers and new market opportunities<br />* Knowledge of Hubspot and/or other CRM software systems<br />* Experience working with Internet of Things devices<br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter by clicking the button below.",

We're creating protocols to allow buyers and sellers of fractional usage assets and services (think Airbnb, Getaround, Fiverr, Taskrabbit) to transact without paying middlemen 20-30%. We're excited by the opportunity to build censorship resistant marketplaces and redistribute value to the contributors to the network instead of just the founders and VCs. We believe the open source protocols we're developing could ultimately replace dozens of existing multimillion or multibillion dollar businesses.<p>We're experienced founders who have built and sold multiple businesses in the past. Origin is the most ambitious idea we've tackled to date (hopefully on the right side of crazy). We currently have a working MVP built on Ethereum and IPFS. We're looking for all sorts of people to join our team, whether you code in react, python or solidity. We're a distributed team and open to remote.</p><p>Ping us at founders@originprotocol.com if you're interested.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

    "content": "Role: Head of Marketing, Switchee Ltd<br />Reporting to: Chief Commercial Officer<br />Location: Camden, London<br /><br />*Our mission*<br /><br />At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper. <br />One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of.  <br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.  <br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it. <br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break. <br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes. <br /><br />*Our journey*<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride. Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. <br />We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact. We are a small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords. <br />We are looking for an outstanding individual to run our marketing department, which promises to grow considerably over the coming years. Your commitment to our values and mission are paramount. <br />Your responsibilities<br /><br />As Head of Marketing, you will oversee and deliver all marketing to continue growing the Switchee brand within the social housing sector and, as we grow, into other sectors (student housing, private rented sector) and geographies.  You will be responsible for managing our external positioning and generating inbound leads to help us achieve our challenging growth targets. <br /><br />*Being more specific, you will:*<br /><br />•    Set the marketing strategy and own all aspects of the delivery<br /><br />•    Help define how we communicate our mission and values to the outside world<br /><br />•    Oversee company rebrand & production of new website<br /><br />•    Deliver inbound leads at target volumes and against target CPAs<br /><br />•    Oversee PR & communications<br /><br />•    Generate insightful, thought provoking written content<br /><br />•    Brief partners to deliver engaging visual & press content<br /><br />•    Manage online and social media marketing & advertising campaigns<br /><br />•    Manage social media (Twitter & LinkedIn)<br /><br />•    Work closely with the sales team to ensure CRO<br /><br />•    Organise attendance at conferences – negotiating exhibitor plots and speaking slots<br /><br />•    Prepare quarterly and annual overviews and forecasts<br /><br />•    Build, train & manage a marketing team<br /><br />We are a company built on a strong technical foundation. You’ll need to grasp and communicate a technical solution with clients. We also expect you to work closely with Product Development to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre. <br /><br />*Your experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />•    At least 3 years B2B marketing experience and team management skills<br /><br />•    Bachelor’s degree from a top university<br /><br />•    Proven ability to develop and implement effective marketing strategies<br /><br />•    Strong analytical & numeracy skills with complete command of Excel<br /><br />•    Research skills to identify new potential customers and new market opportunities<br /><br />•    Knowledge of Hubspot and CRM software and systems<br /><br />•    Experience of a range of marketing tech applications<br /><br />•    Comfort talking in detail about the technology and processes required to manage marketing budgets at scale.<br /><br />•    A strong grasp of the relevance of “brand” & “DR” marketing<br /><br />•    Experience in a small & quickly expanding business<br /><br />•    Knowledge of the housing sector <br /><br />•    Experience working with Internet of Things devices<br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for: <br /><br />•    You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br /><br />•    You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br /><br />•    You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br /><br />•    You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them. <br /><br />•    You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br /><br />•    You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br /><br />•    You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br />*You can expect…*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues. <br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location. <br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company. <br /><br />If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter by responding to this advert",

Are you into meditation, &nbsp;journaling, yoga? We love them all. I’m so glad you have found your teachers and know what inspires you. We’re pretty sure you took one look at our website and went “I love it.” Our mission resonates with you and you are ready to jump in and dedicate your time and effort &nbsp;to help us grow.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In our opinion, there are two sides to being a stellar project manager — managing projects and managing people. We’re looking for someone who is absolutely INCREDIBLE at both! &nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You are outrageously organized — color-coding, folders, and systems are the stuff of dreams. Taking an idea and turning it into a timeline of clear deliverables actually sounds like a fun way to spend a day to you! You are incredibly skilled at both micro and macro thinking — making sure the big picture is always moving forward by way of all the tiny details that need to get done. </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You also love people — you’re a natural mentor and sounding board, and knowing that you helped someone else succeed gives you enormous satisfaction. You love coaching people to do their best, seeing people’s strengths and talents and drawing it out of them even more. You naturally pick up on subtle team dynamics and are able to proactively jump in to assuage a concern or just offer a few words of encouragement. </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You are an incredible problem solver — you are strategic, clever, and quick on your feet. You’ll be the go-to person when we’re trying to figure out a sticky issue. You are extremely resourceful and great at playing detective — you can unravel any problem and figure out what’s really going on, what the missing pieces are, and go out and find them. You do NOT thrive on being micromanaged and love to be given the freedom to excel in your job. Being your own boss within an organization is a dream come true for you. You are open, direct, and straightforward. </strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You believe that honesty, awareness, and ownership are the direct routes to problem solving. You’d rather not play the “blame game,” but instead just correct the issue and keep moving! You are a solution-based thinker who investigates why things went wrong with the goal of improving the process. You believe that a process problem lies at the root of every apparent people problem. It is pretty impossible to faze you and you’re able to take a hit and keep rolling — your goal is to get it done, even if the path that gets there isn’t quite the one that you anticipated!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ABOUT THIS ROLE </strong></p><p><strong>You will be the overall project manager at the Conscious Stories - also known as the Conscious Stories Mama. </strong></p><p><strong>What does this mean? That you’ll be grand central station for all of our projects. You’ll break down our goals into deliverables, hand them off to the right people, then make sure everything is on track and getting done on time. You’re the go-to person for questions, resources, or whatever our team needs to get the job done. </strong></p><p><strong>You are excellent at translating big ideas into projects, from figuring out the master plan to figuring out exactly which details need to be executed when. </strong></p><p><strong>Basically, you are the one who keeps our virtual office humming every day. You keep our team happy and our projects on time. We are mostly a virtual office — that means everyone (including you!) works from your own home office. This means you get all the best parts of interacting with a super fun team, with none of the commute and cubicles!

Our mission is to use these solutions to power the emerging economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, security and infrastructure, and more. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us. Our Enterprise team is responsible for solution development and delivery for corporate clients and has led some of the most innovative production blockchain implementations in the world.</p><p>The Role<br>The business development manager is a consultative sales role at ConsenSys and will be working directly with the Enterprise team in a revenue-generating role, as well as representing broader ConsenSys products to prospective clients. This person will own all business development outcomes. We are looking for a variety of candidates and have needs for flavors of this role, some more partner-relationship centric and some more direct-client centric. We are specifically looking for business development managers to support our partnership activities (primarily cloud providers and solution integrators), financial services efforts (New York and London) and industrial/corporate sales.</p><p>Our business development managers lead technical and delivery teams through complex sales processes: requirements gathering, solution architecture, product and competitive positioning, partner enablement, proposal generation and drafting appropriately scoped statements of work. You could be onstage at a conference one day, working on a client proposal the next, and delivering partner training the following week, all while collaborating with our product teams on feature roadmaps, token launches or marketing roadshows.</p><p>A great candidate for this position will be confident when entering a board room setting and skilled at leading and supporting complex conversations with ease. This person will have a minimum of 3 - 5 years of experience working with with senior level business executives and technologists through enterprise software sales cycles, notably with experience in emerging technology ecosystems. If you worked in a sales, business development or channel management role at a leading big data, machine learning, or PaaS company for the past few years, you may well have the type of background we are looking for. A similar background at a leading systems integrator or in solutions delivery is also relevant. You need to be comfortable being held accountable to client-based outcomes and ultimately revenue performance.</p><p>It’s important to us that you have a clear enthusiasm and aptitude for learning about new industries, technologies, and how they fit together. Bonus points if you have previous experience in FinTech and/or have a deep understanding of the blockchain / Ethereum ecosystem.</p><p>This role does not come neatly packaged or defined. You should expect it to change during your time at ConsenSys, to evolve as our organization evolves. What does that mean for you? We think that means you will have an opportunity to create an exciting role with plenty of growth potential over time.</p><p>When we interview you, we will be looking for people with high levels of emotional intelligence who are also intellectually curious, always professional, dynamic in conversation, charismatic, and persuasive. You must be able to ask specific yet articulate questions, quickly synthesize insights from patterns in conversation, and reflect back the key points from a conversation in order to get alignment, commitments, and lay out next steps.</p><p>From a tactical standpoint, you are highly effective at leading discovery meetings, taking thorough notes, continuously qualifying opportunities in or out of the pipeline, designing and presenting bespoke sales proposals to key stakeholders, and overcoming challenges and objections to get to commitments. You must take a hands on approach throughout the contract / negotiation phase to ensure all stakeholders sign off on the engagement with agreeable terms. Last but not least, we expect the business development manager to complete a successful project handover to the delivery team assigned to the project and maintain the client relationship through the delivery phase.</p><p>If you are ready to take the leap in joining a fast growing company in a business development capacity, we encourage you to apply today!</p><p>Ability to travel 30-50+% required.
