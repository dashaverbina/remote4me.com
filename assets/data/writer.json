ByBox have done this using its world-beating electronic-box technology and in-house developed software platform to provide the most sophisticated field service solution in the UK. The ByBox solution disrupted the market by increasing service while reducing cost for customers, so that it now dominates the UK market.</p><p>ByBox is now taking its technology globally by building on its already impressive software development team to build a technology team capable of delivering electronic box-based solutions to a global market.

This is especially important now, as much of the documentation will be customer-focused; therefore, content must be designed and delivered with an emphasis on presentation, accuracy, clarity, and usability.</p><p>With the support of the development team (in particular the business analysts and system specialists) you will be responsible for owning and maintaining the software team's product catalogue/portfolio and producing user guides (including technical installation instructions), and content for the ByBox marketing team. Working closely with Product Owners you will produce professional documentation for our key products. You will also drive the adoption of the latest mediums for knowledge transfer, such as through e-learning tools, online video, and other techniques. The Software Development team will look to you for guidance on documentation strategy, techniques, templates, and media content.
