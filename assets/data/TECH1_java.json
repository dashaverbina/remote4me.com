It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

This offers researchers/R&D professionals, and their corresponding organisations (ie. pharmas), a highly scalable, modular and reproducible system that automates the analysis processes, learns from the data and provides actionable insights.<br /><br />Our tech team is split into:<br />1. Engineering and Machine Learning: <br />• Stack: Node JS, React, MongoDB<br />• Building Lifebit’s platform. <br /><br />2. Bioinformatics and Genomics:<br />• Building Lifebit’s genomics modules: end-to-end solutions for specific operations and analysis.<br /><br /><br />We are hiring a Senior Java Engineer with at least 3 years of experience. Requirements, knowledge and experience include:<br />• OO language development in Java 8 and Groovy.<br />• Distributed data processing, data-flow based asynchronous data communication.<br />• Working experience with REST APIs.<br />• Build automation with Gradle.<br />• Cloud platforms APIs (AWS, Azure, G-Cloud).<br />• Containerisation software like Docker and/or Singularity.<br />• Distributed systems & big data processing such as Apache Ignite.<br />• Running services in production.<br /><br />Job type: <br />• Full-time.<br /><br />Job Location: <br />• London, we don’t allow fully remote but are open to some flexibility.

Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1.

Teachers are overworked and underappreciated. Bakpax wants to help carry some of the load.</p><p>We were started by the founder of adaptive learning giant Knewton, the head of global content marketing for Outbrain, and the head of engineering for Arena, a healthcare predictive analytics company.</p><p><strong>JOB DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>You want to work with a team of people who get it. They’ve been around the block and they’re still excited about making things. You communicate really well, and value others who do the same. You reflect and learn from your successes, and failures — and you’ve had the opportunity to learn a lot. You want to work with a team of people who figure out a pragmatic, working deployment and CI setup, and then get back to the product. You have strong opinions that you wear lightly. You recognize there’s a bunch of ways to do something well and the important thing is keeping the team working. You don’t spend time bike shedding, nor do you want to explain why bike shedding is a waste of time. You want to be a whole person at work. You want time and flexibility to be you: to go on a walk, take care of your kid, go to the doctor and feel supported by your coworkers. And you want to support them so that they can live good lives too.</p><p>You’re interested in making education better. You want to spend your limited time on this earth working towards something valuable. If you’re reading this and considering this job, we can assume you are incredibly, incredibly lucky, because it means you have a marketable skill that pays very well. You have a career that you’re interested in. You can decide where you want to work.</p><p>And you want to work somewhere that matters.</p><p>We are seeking senior engineers to join our team. Join as one of the first hires in a direct-to-consumer product startup that will make teachers’ lives better and help to improve the learning outcomes of students. You will work with a small team of other very experienced engineers to get everything off the ground. From a computer vision and natural language processing pipeline, to the web API to the deployment &amp; config system — it all needs to be built. This will be very fun to build.</p><p><strong>JOB REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p><ul><li>6 years industry experience</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication</li><li>Strong sense of agency &amp; ownership</li><li>Built and deployed production systems serving hundreds of thousands of users</li><li>Experience with AWS</li></ul><p><strong>NICE TO HAVES:</strong></p><ul><li>Worked for a very early stage startup (you know how to get things going from scratch).</li><li>An appreciation for strong static type systems</li></ul><p><strong>TECHNOLOGY WE USE</strong></p><ul><li>AWS – lambda, dynamodb, sqs, sns managed by Terraform.</li><li>Kotlin – strong statically typed functional language running on the JVM. We get algebraic datatypes AND the Java ecosystem!</li><li>Python – for various glue.</li><li>Phabricator – a developer’s ticketing system. We require code review to keep our sanity.</li></ul><p><strong>MORE ABOUT THE JOB:</strong></p><ul><li>Money – we will pay you</li><li>Equity – it’s early stage so it’s a good amount</li><li>Diversity – Diversity makes us stronger. We value inclusion and celebrate our differences!</li><li>Remote – we work remotely. This is nice, and, like anything, has its drawbacks. We’re committed to helping each other work remotely while building a strong culture. We’ll get together in person from time to time to have fun together, hone our communication skills and plan.</li><li>Healthcare – our government does not provide it, so we will.</li><li>Be a hero to your teacher family members &amp; friends – Seriously. If we can build this it will really be helpful.</li></ul><p>Come work with us.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

We help users all over the world discover the best hiking and biking routes, working to empower everybody to explore more of the great outdoors. And we’re good at what we do: Google and Apple have listed us as one of their Apps of the Year numerous times—and we are consistently ranked amongst the highest-grossing apps in both Google Play and the App Store. One key driving factor to our growth has always been our understanding that a technological approach can provide an outdoor experience far beyond the possibilities of traditional services.

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</a></p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

It has often been said that data is the new currency. Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done. On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts. On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data. At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. Here’s where we are now:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>We are operating in Amazon Web Services. Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</li><li>We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</li><li>Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects. It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</li><li>We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum. We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</li><li>Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</li><li>Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Find out more about our company culture here: http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</div><div><br></div><div>Here are some examples of projects that we would like some help with:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Interactive tools to help buyers discover the data they need to accomplish their business objectives.</li><li>Interactive tools to help sellers maximize the yield from the data that they are selling.</li><li>Data analytics pipelines to drive the interactive report UIs.
