Do you also enjoy engineering management books, and believe in  the value of engineering apprenticeship, which can allow junior engineers to level up in their career? If so, you might enjoy being a Senior Software Engineer at Parse.ly.</p><p>First, let’s answer a key question: what’s Parse.ly? Well, Parse.ly is a real-time content measurement layer for the entire web. Our analytics platform helps digital storytellers at some of the web's best sites, such as Arstechnica, The New Yorker, The Wall Street Journal, TechCrunch, The Intercept, Mashable, and many more. In total, our analytics system handles over 65 billion monthly events from over 1 billion monthly unique visitors.</p><p>Our entire stack is in Python and JavaScript, and our team has innovated in areas related to real-time analytics, building some of the best open source tools for working with modern stream processing technologies.</p><p>On the open source front, we maintain <a href='https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse' rel='nofollow'>streamparse</a>, the most widely used Python binding for the Apache Storm streaming data system. We also maintain <a href='https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka' rel='nofollow'>pykafka</a>, the most performant and Pythonic binding for Apache Kafka.</p><p>Our colleagues are talented: our UX/design team has also built one of the best-looking dashboards on the planet, using AngularJS and D3.js, and our infrastructure engineers have built a scalable devops-friendly cloud environment.</p><p>As a Senior Software Engineer, you would master our backend stack -- or,  fill in whatever gaps you might be missing if you already know some of our technologies. But you’d also spend a portion of your time defining a roadmap for our “Customer Success Engineering” group, which is a group of bright engineers, more junior in their career, who are focusing on customer-facing and customer-deployed data integration challenges. It’s an ideal opportunity to put your programming skills to use, while also flexing some engineering and project management skills, to boot.</p><h4>Responsibilities</h4><p>Parse.ly’s data engineering team already makes use of modern technologies like Python, Storm, Spark, Kafka, and Elasticsearch to analyze large datasets. As a Software Engineer at Parse.ly, you will be expected to master these technologies, while also being able to write code against them in Python, and debug issues down to the native C code and native JVM code layers, as necessary.</p><p>However, your focus will be on deep understanding, commensurate with your technical background. Our product is widely used by over 250 enterprises with over 30,000 active seats, each of whom is viewing our data on a regular basis, and we have a team of engineers who help assist these customers with understanding their data, debugging data integration problems, and investigating code and data discrepancies.

introductory phone call and if it sounds like there’s a match we'll arrange for you to meet the team for a full interview. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The interview process lasts several hours and is sometimes split across two days. &nbsp;It is intended to be challenging - but the developers you meet and the topics you’ll be asked to explain (and code!) should give you a very clear sense of what it would be like to work at Selerity. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We value different perspectives and have built a team that reflects that diversity while maintaining the highest standards of

Social trading takes the activity of &quot;investing&quot; -- which previously happened only&nbsp;in private, like some kind of embarrassing biological process&nbsp;-- and brings it out into the sunshine so that other people can watch and benefit.</p><p>On Collective2's web site, you can find traders and investors that you like and admire, and follow along with them in your own brokerage account. Alternately, if you're a good trader, you can attract followers (and earn extra money doing so).</p><p>So Collective2's business touches a lot of interesting areas: finance, trading, automation, algorithms, big-data, risk analysis.</p><p><strong>Remote Only</strong></p><p>Collective2 is a &quot;distributed&quot; company - no central office, no cubicles, no pointy-headed managers. We are a team of men and women working together, full-time, from homes and coworking facilities all over the world.</p><p>We are a small company. We try to keep things on a human (and humane) scale. No politics, no corporate B.S.</p><p>Because we are small, every software developer has tremendous responsibility. We'll keep you challenged and happy.</p><p>And finally:</p><p>Be honest with yourself. The idea of working remotely sounds appealing, but it drives some percentage of the population bat-shit crazy. If you need proximity to warm human flesh, a foosball table, or a communal water cooler, this position probably isn't&nbsp;for you. But if you want to live anywhere&nbsp;you like in the world, dream of giving up your commute, and like the idea of working from&nbsp;the quiet and peace of your home, it might be perfect.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Competitive salary                            </div>                            <div>                                 Live anywhere, work anywhere                            </div>                            <div>                                 No commute!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Independent working environment                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flat structure                            </div>                    ",

You can see our work at <a href='https://www.omgyes.com' rel='nofollow'>OMGYES.com</a></p><p>We get a huge amount of positive feedback from the press all over the world, and foremost from our users, who tell us how much it has helped their relationships and sex lives. It's been a wonderful, fulfilling journey.</p><p>What we need you to do<br>----------------------------<br>We're always working to keep our busy website (13m req/day) highly available, with minimal latency. We need you to design and implement new features that can scale accordingly. You will be making architectural decisions regarding data storage (database, NoSQL, client-side), content delivery (especially video across a wide range of devices), and gaining user insights through analytics.</p><p>Our users are distributed globally; we need to ensure we can serve a media-rich site in many languages to people all over the world. We need to support purchasing in a range of currencies, using different payment methods, with a careful eye to security.</p><p>Our backend was designed before launch. While it performs quite well, our site has evolved quite a bit since those days. We also have a new season of content that is in production. We've started a new project to build a more appropriate system, starting with season two content, and we want you to work with our front-end team to develop it, using modern best practices.</p><p>Who we're looking for<br>---------------------<br>You are completely at home in a server environment; both in the codebase and in the database. When someone proposes a new site feature, you've already assessed its impact on performance, designed a database schema, and half-architected the solution by the time they finish their pitch. As a full-stack developer, your emphasis is on the backend. You know the ins and outs of OWASP. You believe that design begins with data modeling, and your goal is instant gratification for all consumers of your APIs.</p><p>And, you are a scientist. You measure everything and make that data accessible, so you can make good decisions. You can frame improvements in terms of hypothesis and result, rather than conjecture.</p><p>You have more than 5 years of industry experience.</p><p>Technologies you should know<br>----------------------------<br>(In approximate order of importance, descending, not comprehensive!)</p><p>- MySQL / PostgreSQL<br>- Java (Spring Boot)<br>- Python / Ruby / Node.js (and your favorite web frameworks in each)<br>- Couchbase / Redis<br>- Varnish (and general principles of caching)<br>- AWS S3, EC2, Cloudfront (especially signed URLs)<br>- RESTful API design<br>- Git Flow<br>- Elasticsearch / Kibana / Logstash (self-hosted)<br>- Linux command line<br>- Video content delivery</p><p>Interested?<br>-----------<br>Send us your resume and a few words about why our project in particular interests you.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>(Included in job description)</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About OMGYes            </h2>            <div><p>OMGYes conducts large-scale scientific research into taboo topics like sexual pleasure.

We've got another hire starting in December. In response to increasing client demand for our services we are recruiting for Spring 2018 hires. That said... if you've got a different schedule in mind please apply and let us know what schedule works for you. &nbsp;If you are interested in what you read below please apply and we'll get you started on the process. Thanks ...the Carve team.</p><p><strong>What's the job?</strong></p><ul><li>Information security consulting: assessing the security of software and hardware systems.</li><li>Understanding how systems are built and learning how to break them.</li><li>Working with our experienced team on short-to-medium term engagements.</li></ul><p><strong>What would you do?</strong></p><p>Every two to three weeks you'll get a new project to work on. A typical project will involve:</p><ul><li><strong>Recon</strong>: Digging into the functionality, design, and implementation of the software system or device.</li><li><strong>Probing</strong>: Searching for implementation weaknesses which could indicate a security issue. This is a combination of tools that we use, tools that we build, and manual probing. For device projects this can include firmware extraction, analysis, and hardware interfacing.</li><li><strong>Extending</strong>: Now that you've found a weakness... how far can you extend your access into the system?</li><li><strong>Writing</strong>: Now that you've hacked your way in you'll need to write-up your findings and work with the developers to make sure they understand what the problem is and how to fix it.</li></ul><p>If you enjoy puzzles and technical variety you'll find this job very enjoyable.</p><p><strong>Who are we looking for?</strong></p><ul><li><em>You do not need to have information security experience.</em> If you've got the right technical background and problem solving skills we can train you in the dark arts of infosec.</li><li>People who enjoy writing code, solving problems with code, and learning how computers work at a fundamental level.</li><li>This is not a &quot;travel every week&quot; type of consultant. We do sometimes work at a client site but most of the time we do our projects remotely.</li></ul><p>We’re hiring for all experience levels: from zero career experience to information security veterans.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Deep experience in software and computers. You may have earned this experience with a degree, career as a software developer, or perhaps you've invested in a technical hobby that took you deep into the rabbit hole.</li><li>Technical writing skills (English)</li><li>Resident of the USA and able to be employed in the USA.</li></ul><p>We encourage remote candidates to reply *if* they are residents of the USA.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Carve Systems            </h2>            <div><p>We’re a team of security consultants who do more than hack. We combine engineering and consulting expertise to act as trusted advisors to the world’s largest companies.&nbsp;<br><br>Working at Carve lets you learn from some of the best and brightest in security - and they aren’t just on our team. We believe in engaging with the broader security community to stay on top of our game. You’ll have the opportunity to attend conferences, conduct research, and expand your horizons outside of project-based work. We always enjoy the endorphin rush from finally exploiting &quot;that bug&quot;, but we make a long-term effort to master both technical and consulting skills.<br><br>We are not chained to our computers. We like to stand up and get outside. We trail run, play music, ride bikes, and enjoy well-rounded lives. We believe that wellness and happiness compounds our joys in life and leads to more success in work. We work at a long-term, sustainable pace and actively encourage and help our consultants to pursue their interests outside of security and technology.<br><br>We have offices in the New York City and consultants in Denver, Atlanta, Madrid, and Chicago but any location will do for the right candidate.
