Tired of corporate awareness training, pointless meetings, bloviating managers, and political games? Looking for an environment that hires great engineers, gives them the tools to do great things, and expects them to do so?</p><p>Pyrofex is hiring. Come do your best work.</p><p><strong>About Us</strong></p><p>Pyrofex Corporation is one of Utah Valley's newest cryptocurrency startups. Founded in the Spring of 2016 by ex-Googlers Mike Stay and Nash Foster, Pyrofex is working hard to create the next-generation of blockchain platforms and decentralized applications.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>At Pyrofex, we hire for strength, and not for lack of weakness. We hire for capability and talent, not specific knowledge of a tool or language. We believe real innovation requires constant learning and learning requires constant failure. Nobody learns to ride a bike until they skin their knee. One of our founders has a Ph.D., but the other one dropped out of college. (Twice!) The path we've taken to get this far is unique and we suspect the same will be true of our best employees.</p><p>Pyrofex hires engineers at all levels of experience—from current students, to recent graduates, to academics, to engineers with decades of experience. We are particularly interested in programmers that have knowledge of functional programming, a background in computer science, and can program in Scala. However, if you think this job is a fit for you, we're willing to take a look.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>We are currently hiring Software Engineers to help us deliver the RChain platform, which is written in Scala. Developers on this team will design, implement, test, deploy, and manage a large-scale global software system using Linux, Scala, the JVM, C/C++, and Python.</p><p>Design and architecture requires you to work well with others, take their amorphous sets of needs and use cases, and distill these into written designs and specifications. Good implementations require a fastidious attention to detail, knowledge of your programming tools, and the ability to produce working, correct code on the regular. Pyrofex builds cryptocurrency systems and large-scale distributed and decentralized applications. Five years ago, we thought things like SRE and DevOps would make it clear what &quot;deploy and manage&quot; meant for the future, and now we know we were wrong. The future is changing too fast and our job is to try to keep up. That said, from time to time, we all have to get out of bed at 2AM to deal with something broken.</p><p>If this sounds good to you, then e-mail us at <strong><a href='mailto:jobs@pyrofex.net' rel='nofollow'>jobs@pyrofex.net</a></strong> with the subject line, &quot;AWWWWWW YEAH SIGN ME UP.&quot; We would like to see a resume or your linkedin profile. We would enjoy a cover letter in which you tell us about your work ethic and your favorite project. If you can send us examples of your code, that would be most excellent.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 New Technologies                            </div>                            <div>                                 Work with a highly intelligent and productive team                            </div>                            <div>                                 Full Health benefits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Great communication amongst the team                            </div>                            <div>                                 Build from the ground up and make progress!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Remote Work Available                            </div>                    ",

If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. We greatly limit the number of interns we work with in each division. Applications are now being taken for start dates in late May/early June 2018</p><p>Hashtags, yay!</p><p>No, that's not what we do. </p><p>So, what DO we do? <br>Data-driven, machine learning-infused social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>• Total social media optimization - avoid paying for ads by intelligently automating everything shared to social with images, GIFs, emojis, influencer-tagging. Come up in social search, get curated and republished, and make a visual impact as well.<br>•  Hashtags that are recommended based on current engagement and outcomes, rather than whether they are &quot;trending&quot; (trending = many accounts sending posts with a hashtag; it says nothing about positive outcomes).<br> <br>What you will experience:<br>•  Building not only Android applications, but also a powerful Android extension - a skill that very few mobile developers can claim<br>•  Learn from mentors and peer feedback in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>•  Brainstorm and implement app features<br>•  Build the fully functional app from start to finish<br>•  Exposure to Rest APIs<br>•  We make you part of the process, so you can earn how to bootstrap your own startup, in case you want to do that<br>•  We ship fast - and with over 230,000 registrations, when we make your latest feature live, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for thousands of business people.</p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  Mac / Macbook / Hackintosh<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (we will test you)<br>•  3 months X 20 hours/week commitment<br>•  Our internships are UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. Can lead to a salaried full-time or part-time position, depending on your work, our revenue growth and your availability.<br>•  Desire to work in a startup environment, able to self-manage and work remotely* <br>•  Fluency with Java required. <br>•  Must have built at least one Android app<br>•  Git experience</p><p>* Remotely = you work as we all do, from home or where we live.</p><p>Beneficial but not required:<br>•  Dart and Flutter Framework<br>•  Basic understanding of Android extensions/custom keyboards<br>•  TDD/Testing frameworks awareness (JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, etc.)<br> <br>* As a self-funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends who have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do insist on learning what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers.</p></div>",

    "content": "<h2>              Senior Software Engineer<small> @ Traitify</small>          </h2><dl>          <dt></dt>          <dd><p></p></dd>          <dt></dt>          <dd><p>2018-04-04 18:38</p></dd>          <dt><span>Description</span></dt>          <dd><h5>About Traitify</h5><p>Traitify is revolutionizing the personality assessment industry! Founded in 2011, Traitify has developed a patented methodology by which unique personality profiles are created by users choosing “Me” or “Not Me” when presented with a series of images. Backed by a team of psychologists, we're providing personality based insights to Fortune 100 companies about their customers and employees. Traitify makes personality data accessible to companies looking to better understand their users in order to deliver more personalized recommendations and content.</p><h5>Who You'll Be Working With</h5><p>We're a small team of talented software developers, with a diverse background in various industries and technology stacks. We value individual contributions to team success, and it's through collaboration and these contributions that we create the reliable and performant code that makes Traitify a great place to work. We work remotely and stay in contact primarily through Slack, but also have a daily standup with the whole technology team via Google Hangouts. We understand the value of uninterrupted time, so often we're heads down writing code or researching new technologies or solutions. Speaking of new technologies, we value experimentation to solve new problems, or to improve existing solutions. Here's a few examples:</p><ul><li>Experiment with new languages and platforms to determine direction for future microservices, one of which we're now using in production as a result of this effort.</li><li>Replaced our existing Java based acceptance testing suite with a Python based framework that we can eventually hand to a dedicated testing team.</li><li>Replaced some repetitive JDBC and buggy Hibernate implementations with the JOOQ library.</li></ul><p>We strive to write well-tested and clean code. We perform peer code reviews via Github to help catch defects and learn from one another.</p><p>We also try and get together in person a few times a year, to have face time with each other and the rest of the stellar employees at Traitify.</p><h5>What You'll Be Doing</h5><p>As a Senior Engineer on the API team, you'll be helping develop new features for our public facing API. You'll be helping troubleshoot customer issues, as well as working with teams developing internal tools and products here at Traitify. A typical day can include fixing a defect, writing a new API method to search our database of personality assessment results, reviewing a pull request or load testing our Analytics API methods. We're growing fast, so a few things in our future include:</p><ul><li>Moving the API from a monolith to a microservices architecture.</li><li>Investigating NoSQL or de-normalized datastores.</li><li>Discovering and building ways to interpret our personality data and turn them into actionable insights for our customers.</li></ul><h5>What We Expect From You</h5><ul><li>Strong experience (5+ years) in writing production quality code in a strongly-typed compiled language (Java, Go, C++, etc).</li><li>Strong experience in writing production quality code or writing reusable tooling in a dynamically-typed scripting language (Elixir, Ruby, Python, etc).</li><li>A strong background (at least 3+ years) in writing well used public facing JSON APIs. Knowledge of RESTful practices is a plus.</li><li>Experience writing software at scale. What sort of scale? We do hundreds of thousands of API calls a day, and expect that to grow exponetially in the coming years.</li><li>Comfortable in a *NIX environment and using a shell (bash, zsh, etc).</li><li>Excellent written communication skills.</li><li>Ability to work collaboratively with a remote team. We work primarily via Slack, Google Hangouts, and Github to do our work.</li><li>You write clean, well tested code.</li><li>A commitment to mentoring and self-improvement through code reviews and continuous learning.</li><li>Experience working with cloud based DevOps-managed infrastructure (we use AWS).</li><li>Strong experience with SQL and other datastores. You should be able to reason about ACID and transaction isolation levels, and have a grasp of the CAP theorem.</li></ul><h5>Bonus Skills!</h5><ul><li>GraphQL</li><li>Microservices, in particular experience with messaging services (Kafka, Amazon Kinesis) and RPC frameworks such as gRPC</li><li>CQRS</li><li>Machine Learning and/or Natural Language Processing</li><li>Experience designing and scaling full-text search services</li></ul><h5>Benefits and Perks</h5><ul><li>Vision, Medical, Dental</li><li>Equity</li><li>Company paid vacation</li><li>IRA with Company Contribution</li><li>Work Remotely</li><li>Quarterly Get Togethers</li><li>Choose Your Machine (We primarily use Macs, but if you want a Dell running Linux, do your thing)</li></ul><h5>Sounds Like A Good Fit?</h5><p>Apply to the position, then we'll schedule a phone interview with the team you'll be working with. We'll ask you about your experience, professional goals and any fun hobbies you have. We'll try and tell you anything you want to know about the team, technologies and projects you'll be working with.</p><p>If everything seems good, we'll give you a short programming assignment to work on. We don't expect it to take a long time to complete. We'll set you up in a chat with part of our team so you can ask questions and collaborate, matching it as close as we can to our daily workflow. Once you're done we'll do a follow-up and discuss your assignment. If everything goes well, we'll schedule another interview to make an offer. We hope you'll be as excited to work with us as we are with you!</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. We greatly limit the number of interns we work with in each division. Applications are now being taken for start dates in late May/early June 2018</p><p>Hashtags, yay!</p><p>No, that's not what we do. </p><p>So, what DO we do? <br>Data-driven, machine learning-infused social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>• Total social media optimization - avoid paying for ads by intelligently automating everything shared to social with images, GIFs, emojis, influencer-tagging. Come up in social search, get curated and republished, and make a visual impact as well.<br>•  Hashtags that are recommended based on current engagement and outcomes, rather than whether they are &quot;trending&quot; (trending = many accounts sending posts with a hashtag; it says nothing about positive outcomes).<br> <br>What you will experience:<br>•  Building not only Android applications, but also a powerful Android extension - a skill that very few mobile developers can claim<br>•  Learn from mentors and peer feedback in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>•  Brainstorm and implement app features<br>•  Build the fully functional app from start to finish<br>•  Exposure to Rest APIs<br>•  We make you part of the process, so you can earn how to bootstrap your own startup, in case you want to do that<br>•  We ship fast - and with over 230,000 registrations, when we make your latest feature live, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for thousands of business people.</p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  Mac / Macbook / Hackintosh<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (we will test you)<br>•  3 months X 20 hours/week commitment<br>•  Our internships are UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. Can lead to a salaried full-time or part-time position, depending on your work, our revenue growth and your availability.<br>•  Desire to work in a startup environment, able to self-manage and work remotely* <br>•  Fluency with Java required. <br>•  Must have built at least one Android app<br>•  Git experience</p><p>* Remotely = you work as we all do, from home or where we live.</p><p>Beneficial but not required:<br>•  Dart and Flutter Framework<br>•  Basic understanding of Android extensions/custom keyboards<br>•  TDD/Testing frameworks awareness (JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, etc.)<br> <br>* As a self-funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends who have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do insist on learning what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers.</p></div>",

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

Requirements, knowledge and experience include:<br />• OO language development in Java 8 and Groovy.<br />• Distributed data processing, data-flow based asynchronous data communication.<br />• Working experience with REST APIs.<br />• Build automation with Gradle.<br />• Cloud platforms APIs (AWS, Azure, G-Cloud).<br />• Containerisation software like Docker and/or Singularity.<br />• Distributed systems & big data processing such as Apache Ignite.<br />• Running services in production.<br /><br />Job type: <br />• Full-time.<br /><br />Job Location: <br />• London, we don’t allow fully remote but are open to some flexibility. If you’re based in Cambridge, for example, we’d cover your commute to London and after the initial on-boarding period, we’d be happy to explore being at the office for just 3 days/week.<br /><br /><br />_____________________________<br /><br />More about the team:<br /><br />Lifebit’s founding team has over 30 years of combined experience in the field - they know first-hand what the need is and how to build the right technological solution to address its pain-points. Prior to founding Lifebit, they worked on building the programming language that is predominantly used in the genomics world to develop applications that are faster and better at analysing DNA data - Nextflow (https://www.nextflow.io/) published on Nature Biotechnology. <br /><br />Nextflow’s quick and overreaching adoption shows the urgent need the industry faces for a solution that addresses the increasing computational and big data challenges related to any genomics analysis.<br /><br />_____________________________<br /><br /><br />All above requirements and specs are just an indication of what we’re looking for. However, sometimes the perfect person is far more or less experienced than we anticipated. If you think that might be the case, please apply and just let us know.",

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Medical, Dental and Vision Plans                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commuter Benefits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Health Savings Accounts (HSA)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Employee Assistance Program (EAP)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.                            </div>                    ",

Teachers are overworked and underappreciated. Bakpax wants to help carry some of the load.</p><p>We were started by the founder of adaptive learning giant Knewton, the head of global content marketing for Outbrain, and the head of engineering for Arena, a healthcare predictive analytics company.</p><p><strong>JOB DESCRIPTION</strong></p><p>You want to work with a team of people who get it. They’ve been around the block and they’re still excited about making things. You communicate really well, and value others who do the same. You reflect and learn from your successes, and failures — and you’ve had the opportunity to learn a lot. You want to work with a team of people who figure out a pragmatic, working deployment and CI setup, and then get back to the product. You have strong opinions that you wear lightly. You recognize there’s a bunch of ways to do something well and the important thing is keeping the team working. You don’t spend time bike shedding, nor do you want to explain why bike shedding is a waste of time. You want to be a whole person at work. You want time and flexibility to be you: to go on a walk, take care of your kid, go to the doctor and feel supported by your coworkers. And you want to support them so that they can live good lives too.</p><p>You’re interested in making education better. You want to spend your limited time on this earth working towards something valuable. If you’re reading this and considering this job, we can assume you are incredibly, incredibly lucky, because it means you have a marketable skill that pays very well. You have a career that you’re interested in. You can decide where you want to work.</p><p>And you want to work somewhere that matters.</p><p>We are seeking senior engineers to join our team. Join as one of the first hires in a direct-to-consumer product startup that will make teachers’ lives better and help to improve the learning outcomes of students. You will work with a small team of other very experienced engineers to get everything off the ground. From a computer vision and natural language processing pipeline, to the web API to the deployment &amp; config system — it all needs to be built. This will be very fun to build.</p><p><strong>JOB REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p><ul><li>6 years industry experience</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication</li><li>Strong sense of agency &amp; ownership</li><li>Built and deployed production systems serving hundreds of thousands of users</li><li>Experience with AWS</li></ul><p><strong>NICE TO HAVES:</strong></p><ul><li>Worked for a very early stage startup (you know how to get things going from scratch).</li><li>An appreciation for strong static type systems</li></ul><p><strong>TECHNOLOGY WE USE</strong></p><ul><li>AWS – lambda, dynamodb, sqs, sns managed by Terraform.</li><li>Kotlin – strong statically typed functional language running on the JVM. We get algebraic datatypes AND the Java ecosystem!</li><li>Python – for various glue.</li><li>Phabricator – a developer’s ticketing system. We require code review to keep our sanity.</li></ul><p><strong>MORE ABOUT THE JOB:</strong></p><ul><li>Money – we will pay you</li><li>Equity – it’s early stage so it’s a good amount</li><li>Diversity – Diversity makes us stronger. We value inclusion and celebrate our differences!</li><li>Remote – we work remotely. This is nice, and, like anything, has its drawbacks. We’re committed to helping each other work remotely while building a strong culture. We’ll get together in person from time to time to have fun together, hone our communication skills and plan.</li><li>Healthcare – our government does not provide it, so we will.</li><li>Be a hero to your teacher family members &amp; friends – Seriously. If we can build this it will really be helpful.</li></ul><p>Come work with us.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

On the one side, we collect, combine and process various open data sources (such as OSM and Wikipedia) and turn raw data into easily accessible information and understandable products, such as our easy-to-use outdoor route planner. On the other, we leverage the wisdom of our vast user base and use crowdsourced data for personalized, local outdoor recommendations.
