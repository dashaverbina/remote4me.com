It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</a></p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

It has often been said that data is the new currency. Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done. On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts. On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data. At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch. Here’s where we are now:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>We are operating in Amazon Web Services. Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</li><li>We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</li><li>Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects. It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</li><li>We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum. We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</li><li>Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</li><li>Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Find out more about our company culture here: http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</div><div><br></div><div>Here are some examples of projects that we would like some help with:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Interactive tools to help buyers discover the data they need to accomplish their business objectives.</li><li>Interactive tools to help sellers maximize the yield from the data that they are selling.</li><li>Data analytics pipelines to drive the interactive report UIs. For example: reports for yield forecasting and deal pre-qualification.</li><li>Implementing additional infrastructure to support transactions for more types of data.</li><li>Improving the latency and resource usage of our transaction processes.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>The ideal candidate should:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Be able to work across all aspects of back end systems, from application code to SQL to systems administration.</li><li>Be comfortable in a common back end language such as Java or C# – or even better, their functional equivalents, Scala / F#.</li><li>Have experience operating in a cloud environment like Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, or similar.</li><li>Not be afraid of contributing to the entire stack (from Frontend to Devops) when the need arises.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>You don’t need to be an expert in all of our stack, but we are looking for someone with strong technical skills who is eager to pick up new technologies as necessary.</div><div><br></div><div>We are building the team with a remote-first mindset, and as a result every team member is expected to have an ability to synthesize business requirements, distill the domain, contribute to high-level design documents, efficiently communicate asynchronously, and more generally work autonomously toward a shared vision.</div><div><br></div><div>Continuously investing in quality (code quality, tests, pull request reviews, refactoring…) is part of our strategy to sustainably maximize the business value we deliver.</div><div><br></div><div>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.<br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Shoot an email over to <a href='mailto:hiring@narrative.io' rel='nofollow'>hiring@narrative.io</a></p>  </div>",

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Find out about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture/</a></p><p>Apply at hiring@narrative.io.

BAMTech isn’t just about streaming Baseball – we also manage HBO Now, NHL, Twitter NFL, Fox Sports Go, WWE, and several other content providers. You would be helping a team whose services act as the linchpin for video playback, handling new challenges of scale and speed in a rapidly growing industry. The company is aggressively expanding to meet increased demand, and you would be getting in on the ground floor of this new opportunity. You would help the team create new designs to meet our scaling demands, build out services in cloud infrastructure providers with exposure to AWS EC2, S3, Dynamo, and Kinesis, and help the team introduce new processes to scale. If you like tinkering with new technologies, have experience with high scale systems, or simply want to gain exposure to new tools, this team is a great fit. You’d be helping the team embrace microservices architecture with an emphasis on non-blocking, highly concurrent programming. Experience with Scala/Play/Akka is highly preferred, but not a requirement. With strong CS fundamentals and an entrepreneurial attitude, you’d be an asset to our team.</p><p>PM me to apply.</p><p>Read more here: <a href='https://www.bamtechmedia.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.bamtechmedia.com/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",
