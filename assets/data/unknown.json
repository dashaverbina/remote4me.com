You'll interact daily with the co-owners, and have&nbsp;your ideas live and tested almost as quickly as you come up with them.&nbsp;Spend time implementing, and reviewing your concepts, not waiting for them to be approved&nbsp;by 3 VPs.</div><div><br></div><div>We're a young, motivated team that's entirely remote and distributed globally. Sick of that commute, or reminding the in-person team that you're still alive? Here we're all in the same position. You dictate when and where&nbsp;you do the work --&nbsp;fit it around your life without feeling guilty.</div><div><br></div><div>We know little about Social Media and PR. These are the&nbsp;two major gaps we're trying to fill. But if you've got experience in other areas like email marketing, PPC, branding, or anything else, we'd still love to hear from you. &nbsp;</div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>To apply, please send your best proof of being able to help us to <a href='mailto:apply@secretbenefits.com' rel='nofollow'>apply@secretbenefits.com</a> Hint: A track record of success, particularly if it's in PR or social media, is what we're especially interested in.</p>  </div>",
