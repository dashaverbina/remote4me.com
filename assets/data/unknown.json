Even though we’ve been trading stocks successfully since 2012, we have never hired anybody to help – we have done all the strategy, trading, and technology ourselves. Our focus is on the investment strategy, but we are good coders and have built a solid infrastructure for a two-man operation.</p><p>Now it’s time to take off, and we’re hiring a small team to expand the business.</p><p><strong>Here’s where you come in—</strong></p><p>We need a top notch tech guru to lead the entire tech of our firm as we expand. Think of it as a CTO type role – you will report directly to the founders. You’d have a wide range of skills (enterprise IT admin, app dev) and be managing everything – from finding the right enterprise solutions as we expand, to extending our Python quantitative backend infrastructure, to managing databases, networks and permissions. Everything technology-related will be under your purview. And at least initially, you will be the only person on our team focused on tech full-time.</p><p>Our culture is casual with a start-up feel. We care deeply about efficiency and robust tech, but not how you choose to manage your schedule. We care about our lifestyles but don’t want to dictate yours. You’ll be working remotely but will have constant access to the founders, who will give you feedback and growth.</p><p><strong>Ideal candidate would have:</strong></p><ul><li>Top notch coding skills. You will need to be able write robust, clean code with a focus on extensibility and performance. We use Python throughout, but as tech lead you might decide e.g. Java/C++ is more suitable for a particular solution.</li><li>Experience with hedge fund technology (managing positions, broker data, market data, etc.) a big plus.</li><li>Experience with databases and managing data.</li><li>Experience with configuring and permissioning enterprise apps for a growing organization.</li><li>Experience with integration of back-end systems with Excel. Currently we use PyXLL, a cool system that integrates a Python backend with Excel.</li><li>Strong communication skills and ability to work remotely and manage your own schedule.</li><li>Creativity and being highly proactive in your solutions, passion about tech and coding, and staying well-informed of cool new solutions for tech problems.</li></ul>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote Work                            </div>                    ",

We're very focused on helping our largest \nclients develop/extend the original functionality of their complex Microsoft \nAccess applications to mobile, web and the cloud.\n\n Here's a cool video where we show Microsoft Access running on the iPad, \niPhone and in the cloud.\nhttps://www.help4access.com/access-database-mobile-iphone-ipad-cloud/ \n<https://www.help4access.com/access-database-mobile-iphone-ipad-cloud/>\n\n We've developed some really cool tools to help programmatically perform much \nof the heavy lifting when migrating Microsoft Access applications to other \ntechnologies such as SQL Sever, Oracle, ASP dot NET, Java and more. These tools \nand techniques are constantly evolving to fit our customer's need.\n\n See how we helped Albertsons/Safeway manage over 65,000 MS Access databases:\nhttps://www.help4access.com/ms-access-risk-mitigation-pt1/ \n<https://www.help4access.com/ms-access-risk-mitigation-pt1/>\n\n I'm sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch, I'm just very excited about our \nmission and what we've accomplished.\n\n In fact, that's another reason why Help4Access is good for you. This is it: \nsales, marketing, legal, billing, collections, business development. Yip, you \nnever have to do it again! You get to stay focused on what you like to do and \nthat is add value by writing great MS Access desktop database applications. \nStaying focused on what you like to do is how you get great. Help4Access helps \nyou focus on your core strengths which is one big reason why the team at \nHelp4Access is the best in the world. It really cannot be done any other way.\n\n About you:\n You should be fairly self sufficient with your current clients or perhaps \nsemi-retired. On-boarding at Help4Access can be a slow process. Let me backup. \nMy goal with every consultant is to keep them booked as much as they would like \nto be booked.\n\n Some consultants need 40+ hours a week, while other consultants prefer 8 to \n16 hours a week or seasonal.\n\n So, when I when I land a new project, I match the client's expectations with \na consultant's needs. I like to think of it as a cadence or a dance. All \nparties must be aligned and start off on the right foot.\n\n I don't take on small projects or high risk clients. Many of our largest \nclients have life-time projects requiring 20-30 hours a week forever. All \nremote work completed from your home office over your fast internet but face to \nface meetings with your accounts from time to time may be required. You must be \navailable during normal business hours for phone calls and meetings. This is \nnot the kind of work you can do in addition to a full-time job.\n\n So back to on boarding. Once you join, your first project will be light. I'll \nbe organizing the meetings between you and the client and attending the \nmeetings to see how you do. Then, the projects you'll be assigned will be \nlarger and more complex as I gain confidence in your skills and style.\n\n We support the world's most complex MS Access applications. One of our larger \nclients has 50,000 users leveraging data centers in San Francisco, Chicago and \nIndia running 24x7 with call centers in all three area. The database holds \ncritical life support data. All on Microsoft Access to SQL Server.\n\n We get some simple projects too, but I want you to have a feel for the level \nof complexity you should expect to grow into being able to handle if you want \nlong term high numbers of hours per week project assignments.\n\n Also, you must have SQL Server experience and basically be a development DBA, \nmeaning, you can write stored procedures and debug them no problem. Also, would \nbe great if you have touched Azure and double-great if you are comfortable \ndeveloping in ASP dot NET. But some of this is not too important because we \nhave a partners for hardcore DBA production work as well as large scale web and \nmobile development too.\n\n That's it. If you are not sure about joining Help4Access, I completely \nunderstand. Hopefully the above gives you kind of a career roadmap to becoming \na world-class MS Access consultant (I prefer the title Solution Architect as \nappose to MS Access consultant. Google this: &quot;togaf solution architecture \ndefinition&quot;).\n\n Here is the link to the online application. This link will take you to a page \non our site where there is another link to a Google Form\nhttps://www.help4access.com/ms-access-consultant-application/ \n<https://www.help4access.com/ms-access-consultant-application/>\n\n Please complete the online application and include a link to your LinkedIn \nprofile (REQUIRED).\n\n I'll review your application and be back in touch via email within a week or \ntwo.\n\n If selected, the next step will be setting up a GoToMeeting meeting to get to \nknow each-other and review a few applications you've developed. For the \nmeeting/demo, please think about code reuse, table design, 3NF and how you've \nmade enhancement suggestions to your clients which resulted in greater \napplication stability and usability (I want to see if you can grow an account \nand keep the project moving).\n\n Kind regards,\n Sasha Froyland - Founder - Enterprise Architect\n San Francisco, CA\n www.linkedin.com/in/sashafroyland/ \n * Principals only.
