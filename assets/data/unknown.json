Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>ACT’s Core Infrastructure team is seeking fundraisers to help build the zero carbon footprint future version of our planet. Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>We believe that the core problem of global warming is lack of global collaboration. Our goal is to support and enhance global collaboration facilitated by an ecosystem of carefully crafted software systems. Just like Wikipedia is a computer facilitated collaboration platform around building the world’s biggest encyclopedia – so will ACT enable collaboration around green shopping and help humans ACT together for a sustainable planet so that we can do our part to end global warming and also support fair trade.</p><p>- ACT is software technology with smart gamification to connect consumers around sustainable shopping and collaboration.<br>- The immediate goal of ACT is to reduce climate gasses and possibly be the “solution” to global climate change.<br>- ACT is a role model of a democratic organization: Max factor of 8 between highest and lowest paid, all employees has 1 vote, no person or organization can own voting shares (i.e. no external organization can control ACT, which is important to keep us a partner of independent advice).<br>- All software is expected to be open source and free, so that all can take action.</p><p>We have just finished a major design phase and now wish to start serious development of the software platform. We are looking to tell the world about our extraordinary solution for ACTion, that we believe will change the way we manage global climate change almost overnight.</p><p>We need to strengthen our team, our advisory board and council with experienced resources within multiple fields: Management, Communication/journalism/marketing, Financial management, Fundraising, Life cycle analysis &amp; research, Graphical design, Web development, Mobile development, Backend development, Networking.</p><p>WHY ACT?<br>Have you ever thought that it is impossible to solve global climate change and that your effort would mean so little?</p><p>What if you had the chance to work with one of the most ambitious climate change projects? We believe that ACT is one of the most hands-on solutions to mitigating climate change. These might sound like just 'great words,' but do the math yourself: E.g. If only 1700 people decided to use ACT to find the least fossil fuel consuming goods, service alternatives and register their purchases it would deliver a combined purchasing power of 63 million USD/year after tax*, which is the same amount Norway uses to conserve the Amazonas rainforest! And those 1700 people could decide to ACT tomorrow!</p><p>* Assuming a salary of 37,000 USD/year after tax.</p><p>JOB DESCRIPTION, FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS<br>ACT is now selling shares and applying for funding with various organizations. We need 2 highly motivated FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS to join our Core team in this exciting phase that will have a serious impact on sustainability of our planet. </p><p>At best the following requirements apply to you:</p><p>- You have applied and won support from Innovasjon Norge on multiple occasions.<br>- You have applied and won support from various other foundations.<br>- You have experience from selling shares.<br>- You have a good network.<br>- You have a good command of English.</p><p>The fundraisers will work closely with co-founders and be a part of our small team of entrepreneurs with a flat organizational structure. Since the company is in an early phase you will be able to shape your role in the company exactly how you like it best.</p><p>WORK PLACE<br>This job should at best be carried out as much as possible in co-location with ACT in Oslo, but we are open to remote work too.</p><p>APPLICATION<br>Please send your CV and some words introducing yourself, why you want to work with ACT, highlight relevant previous experience and your current situation.</p><p>For more information about this job and ACT please contact:</p><p>Thomas Jepsen<br>President, Founder &amp; CTO<br>ACT Cooperative Corporation AS</p></div>",

Even though we’ve been trading stocks successfully since 2012, we have never hired anybody to help – we have done all the strategy, trading, and technology ourselves. Our focus is on the investment strategy, but we are good coders and have built a solid infrastructure for a two-man operation.</p><p>Now it’s time to take off, and we’re hiring a small team to expand the business.</p><p><strong>Here’s where you come in—</strong></p><p>We need a top notch tech guru to lead the entire tech of our firm as we expand. Think of it as a CTO type role – you will report directly to the founders. You’d have a wide range of skills (enterprise IT admin, app dev) and be managing everything – from finding the right enterprise solutions as we expand, to extending our Python quantitative backend infrastructure, to managing databases, networks and permissions. Everything technology-related will be under your purview. And at least initially, you will be the only person on our team focused on tech full-time.</p><p>Our culture is casual with a start-up feel. We care deeply about efficiency and robust tech, but not how you choose to manage your schedule. We care about our lifestyles but don’t want to dictate yours. You’ll be working remotely but will have constant access to the founders, who will give you feedback and growth.</p><p><strong>Ideal candidate would have:</strong></p><ul><li>Top notch coding skills. You will need to be able write robust, clean code with a focus on extensibility and performance. We use Python throughout, but as tech lead you might decide e.g. Java/C++ is more suitable for a particular solution.</li><li>Experience with hedge fund technology (managing positions, broker data, market data, etc.) a big plus.</li><li>Experience with databases and managing data.</li><li>Experience with configuring and permissioning enterprise apps for a growing organization.</li><li>Experience with integration of back-end systems with Excel. Currently we use PyXLL, a cool system that integrates a Python backend with Excel.</li><li>Strong communication skills and ability to work remotely and manage your own schedule.</li><li>Creativity and being highly proactive in your solutions, passion about tech and coding, and staying well-informed of cool new solutions for tech problems.</li></ul>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote Work                            </div>                    ",

Even though we’ve been trading stocks successfully since 2012, we have never hired anybody to help – we have done all the strategy, trading, and technology ourselves. Our focus is on the investment strategy, but we are good coders and have built a solid infrastructure for a two-man operation.</p><br><p>Now it’s time to take off, and we’re hiring a small team to expand the business.</p><br><p><strong>Here’s where you come in—</strong></p><br><p><span>We need a top notch tech guru to handle the entire tech infrastructure of our firm as we expand. Think of it as a one-man CTO type role – you will report directly to the founders. You’d have a wide range of skills (enterprise IT admin, app dev) and be managing everything infrastructure-related from top to bottom – from finding the right enterprise solutions as we expand, to extending our Python quantitative backend, to managing databases, networks and permissions. </span><strong>At least initially, you will be the only person on our team focused on tech full-time (i.e. not a managerial role).</strong></p><br><p><span>Our culture is casual with a start-up feel. We care deeply about efficiency and robust tech, but not how you choose to manage your schedule. We care about our lifestyles but don’t want to dictate yours. You’ll be working remotely but will have constant access to the founders, who will give you feedback and growth.</span></p><br><p><strong>Some examples of projects you might do:</strong></p><br><ul><br><li><span>Manage permissions and active directory, set up a VPN or figure out a virtual desktop solution if required.</span></li><br><li><span>Create a desktop/web app with&nbsp;integrated views on the firm’s P&amp;L and risk.</span></li><br><li><span>Maintain database of tick data received from third-party vendors and write high-performance accessor functions in Python.</span></li><br><li><span>Integrate an on-demand market data service, e.g. Factset, into our Python environment with high-performance queries or batching API calls with intelligent caching.</span></li><br><li><span>Create a lightweight alert system for Windows to warn us of upcoming earnings and other time-critical events.</span></li><br><li><span>Create a system that integrates real-time positions from our brokers into Python and Excel.</span></li><br><li><span>Create automated trade reports to send to a middle-office team.</span></li><br></ul><br><p><strong>Ideal candidate would have:</strong></p><br><ul><br><li><span>Top notch coding skills. You will need to be able write robust, clean code with a focus on extensibility and performance. We use Python throughout, but as tech lead you might decide e.g. Java/C++ is more suitable for a particular solution for performance.</span></li><br><li><span>Experience with hedge fund infrastructure (position tracking, broker data, market data, etc.) a big plus. </span><strong>Experience developing trading strategies not required</strong><span>.</span></li><br><li><span>Experience with managing databases and writing highly efficient queries..</span></li><br><li><span>Experience with configuring and permissioning enterprise IT for a growing organization.</span></li><br><li><span>Experience with integration of back-end infrastructure with Excel is a plus. Currently we use PyXLL, a cool system that integrates a Python backend with Excel.</span></li><br><li><span>Strong communication skills and ability to work remotely and manage your own schedule.</span></li><br><li><span>Creativity and being highly proactive in your solutions, passionate about tech and coding, and staying well-informed of cool new solutions for tech problems.</span></li><br></ul></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",
