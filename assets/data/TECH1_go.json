Significant overlap with US Central time zone required. You will be expected to communicate regularly with the rest of your team, working out problems and collaborating in a daily basis to drag projects across the finish line. The ability to take lead on projects falling under your responsibility is paramount. While we do not use a strict Agile methodology, you must be comfortable working closely with the rest of the company to ensure an iterative process. We require a basic working proficiency in the written and spoken English language, and the ability to travel to the United States 1-4 times a year for team meet-ups.</p><p>Much as we believe in internet privacy for all, we do not discriminate in who we choose to be part of our team. We know no boundaries based on race, ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexuality, or other terms humans use to separate the 'us' from the 'them'. If you can do the job and communicate readily, we will be happy to work with you.</p><p>We offer a compensation package including paid vacation, holiday, and personal time for all, and US workers enjoy a full benefits package including medical, dental, vision, life, and short and long term disability insurance.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Paid time off and corporate holidays                            </div>                            <div>                                 Full medical, dental, vision                            </div>                            <div>                                 Company provided hardware                            </div>                            <div>                                 Work from anywhere in the world                            </div>                    ",
