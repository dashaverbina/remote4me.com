At ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.</p><p>As consultants, we work on-site with our clients to ensure we’re delivering the best possible solution. Our Lead Dev plays an important role in leading these projects to success.</p><p>Curious what makes a developer a Lead within ConsenSys? A lead is:</p><p>Often the day-to-day primary point of contact with our clients</p><p>Able to strategically lead a project team to successful delivery</p><p>Excited to mentor, influence and lead a team of ConsenSys employees as well as engage and advise clients</p><p>An expert in at least one language or domain, and maybe in 2 or more</p><p>Owner of the technical recommendations to the client - both on technology/tool choices as well as architecture</p><p> </p><p>We believe that to flourish in this role, you have the following competencies::</p><p>Technical Skills</p><p>Core blockchain concepts. Blockchain is a new field of technology that is rapidly evolving. If you are not yet fully immersed in the technology, you should be willing to dive deep down the rabbit hole.</p><p>Architecture. You should be comfortable working with your team to craft a design: choosing the appropriate technology and designing a solution that both answers the problem at hand, and stays within constraints.</p><p>Coding. Our Leads never go post-technical.  We think that it’s important for technical leadership to continue to code.  Our clients don’t all work in one language or platform, and neither do we. As a lead, we’re looking for a breadth of experience in multiple languages, and expertise in one or two: Javascript is high on our list. (Other notables: Python, Java, Haskell, Golang) You should also be up to speed on practices like TDD, continuous integration, pairing, and infrastructure automation.</p><p>Understanding and often playing a major part in the entire cycle of software consulting and delivery, from ideation, to project conception, to UX, to code, to testing, to deployment, and around again.  </p><p>Agile. We believe strongly in agile delivery practices, having implemented them for ourselves and our clients to great success. You should be very comfortable working with Agile, Lean and Continuous Delivery practices -- and love it as much as we do.</p><p>Soft Skills</p><p>Mentoring a team and bringing them up to speed on new languages and skills. We all learn from each other, but with the breadth of technical experience you’ll bring to the table, you’ll be an invaluable teacher to your less-experienced peers.</p><p>Thinking big and acting fast. You’ll need a startup mentality with enterprise awareness. That means you can manage competing priorities, that you’re ready to pivot or adjust plans quickly, and that you understand the role you and your team play in major organizations’ tech strategies.</p><p>Influencing priorities, for both the team and the client. You understand both the business problem and the technical solution, and you’re able to advocate for excellence and effect change when necessary.</p><p>Finesse. As consultants, we navigate within our client’s organizations to influence big decision makers and win trust. In this job, you’ll be using your people skills as much as your coding skills. Managing client expectations and ensuring the team meets deadlines is critical.</p><p>And here are some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:</p><p>The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.</p><p>A dynamic startup environment. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization.</p><p>Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</p><p>Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much work to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users. ConsenSys is building the technology platforms that can get us to those next thresholds of scale.</p><p>ConsenSys was just named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators report</p></div>",

We are building that infrastructure. To continue that work, we're looking for people who thoroughly understand the principles of distributed systems and who will lean into the challenges of applying those principles in open-source code that will be deployed worldwide.</p><p><strong>Distributed Systems Engineering at Protocol Labs</strong></p><p>Distributed systems engineering lies at the center of many projects at Protocol Labs. With IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin and other related projects we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, more secure, distributed version of the web. This requires rigorous engineering from protocol design through all the phases of implementation. We strike a balance between pragmatism (put it on a ship ⛴), deeply informed protocol design, and strict application of strong engineering principles. All of this happens in an environment defined by curiosity, passion, and a love for open source.</p><p><strong>As a Distributed Systems Software Engineer at Protocol Labs you might …</strong></p><ul><li>Create elegant, reusable open-source solutions to hard distributed systems problems</li><li>Contribute to steering and maintenance of the JavaScript or Go implementations of IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p and similar open source projects</li><li>Participate in the design of performant and resilient applications</li><li>Integrate research results into real programs</li><li>Provide code reviews, guidance, and encouragement for open source contributors around the world</li></ul><p><strong>You may be a fit for this role if you have:…</strong></p><ul><li>Significant experience building applications using Go, Universal JavaScript, or related languages (required)</li><li>Solid understanding of distributed systems principles (required)</li><li>A good understanding of the Web's application model (required)</li><li>Literacy with cryptographic principles and practices</li><li>Experience Implementing distributed software systems and applications that overcome the challenges of p2p networking</li><li>A fiery passion for busting through NATs</li><li>Experience leading and guiding Open Source projects (preferred)</li><li>Experience Implementing DHTs, consensus (Raft/PAXOS) and/or blockchain-based protocols (preferred)</li><li>Experience with 1 or more of the following: Smart Contracts, storage platforms, UNIX file systems, VMs (preferred)</li><li>Proficiency at tuning network applications for high and low bandwidth settings (preferred)</li></ul><p><strong>What’s it like to work at Protocol Labs?</strong></p><p>Protocol Labs mission is to improve humanity’s most important technology, the Internet. We build protocols, systems, and tools to improve how it works. Today, we are focused on how we store, locate, and move information. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and more.</p><p>As a distributed team, we hire anywhere in the world, and at various levels of experience (entry, senior, staff).
