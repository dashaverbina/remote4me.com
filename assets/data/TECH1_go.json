We are building that infrastructure. To continue that work, we're looking for people who thoroughly understand the principles of distributed systems and who will lean into the challenges of applying those principles in open-source code that will be deployed worldwide.</p><p><strong>Distributed Systems Engineering at Protocol Labs</strong></p><p>Distributed systems engineering lies at the center of many projects at Protocol Labs. With IPFS, libp2p, Filecoin and other related projects we are laying the foundation for a more resilient, more secure, distributed version of the web. This requires rigorous engineering from protocol design through all the phases of implementation. We strike a balance between pragmatism (put it on a ship ⛴), deeply informed protocol design, and strict application of strong engineering principles. All of this happens in an environment defined by curiosity, passion, and a love for open source.</p><p><strong>As a Distributed Systems Software Engineer at Protocol Labs you might …</strong></p><ul><li>Create elegant, reusable open-source solutions to hard distributed systems problems</li><li>Contribute to steering and maintenance of the JavaScript or Go implementations of IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p and similar open source projects</li><li>Participate in the design of performant and resilient applications</li><li>Integrate research results into real programs</li><li>Provide code reviews, guidance, and encouragement for open source contributors around the world</li></ul><p><strong>You may be a fit for this role if you have:…</strong></p><ul><li>Significant experience building applications using Go, Universal JavaScript, or related languages (required)</li><li>Solid understanding of distributed systems principles (required)</li><li>A good understanding of the Web's application model (required)</li><li>Literacy with cryptographic principles and practices</li><li>Experience Implementing distributed software systems and applications that overcome the challenges of p2p networking</li><li>A fiery passion for busting through NATs</li><li>Experience leading and guiding Open Source projects (preferred)</li><li>Experience Implementing DHTs, consensus (Raft/PAXOS) and/or blockchain-based protocols (preferred)</li><li>Experience with 1 or more of the following: Smart Contracts, storage platforms, UNIX file systems, VMs (preferred)</li><li>Proficiency at tuning network applications for high and low bandwidth settings (preferred)</li></ul><p><strong>What’s it like to work at Protocol Labs?</strong></p><p>Protocol Labs mission is to improve humanity’s most important technology, the Internet. We build protocols, systems, and tools to improve how it works. Today, we are focused on how we store, locate, and move information. Our projects include IPFS, Filecoin, libp2p, and more.</p><p>As a distributed team, we hire anywhere in the world, and at various levels of experience (entry, senior, staff).

First in the backup area with SpiderOak ONE, and now expanding to group messaging with Semaphor.</p><p>We are a remote friendly company, but if you are local to Kansas City you are always welcome to work from the office. Significant overlap with US Central time zone required. You will be expected to communicate regularly with the rest of your team, working out problems and collaborating in a daily basis to drag projects across the finish line. The ability to take lead on projects falling under your responsibility is paramount. While we do not use a strict Agile methodology, you must be comfortable working closely with the rest of the company to ensure an iterative process. We require a basic working proficiency in the written and spoken English language, and the ability to travel to the United States 1-4 times a year for team meet-ups.</p><p>Much as we believe in internet privacy for all, we do not discriminate in who we choose to be part of our team. We know no boundaries based on race, ethnic origin, religion, gender, sexuality, or other terms humans use to separate the 'us' from the 'them'. If you can do the job and communicate readily, we will be happy to work with you.</p><p>We offer a compensation package including paid vacation, holiday, and personal time for all, and US workers enjoy a full benefits package including medical, dental, vision, life, and short and long term disability insurance.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Paid time off and corporate holidays                            </div>                            <div>                                 Full medical, dental, vision                            </div>                            <div>                                 Company provided hardware                            </div>                            <div>                                 Work from anywhere in the world                            </div>                    ",
