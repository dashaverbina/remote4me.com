You’ll create and iterate on our marketing efforts, particularly advertising, email marketing, and our website funnel. Other moving parts include marketing automation, site optimization and analytics, blog and web content, search engine marketing, and ad tools.</p><p>We’re looking for prior experience in digital marketing, marketing operations, or marketing communications, but that’s not rigid. If you are curious, adaptable, and kind, you can get the hang of this. Other members of our marketing team have been an unsuccessful screenwriter and a bartender at a Cajun restaurant, and our CEO started his career selling vacuum cleaners. It takes all kinds.</p><p><strong>About npm</strong></p><p>npm is kind of a big deal. Over 9 million software developers worldwide use npm, Inc.’s open source software and web registry to discover, share, and reuse packages of code. Our users download over 550,000 packages more than 3 billion times per week, and registry downloads have grown by more than 16x in the last two years.</p><p>Our paid products and services offer teams and companies additional ways to organize, share, and secure code, integrate npm with testing and deployment tools, and bring code reuse into the enterprise. More than 100,000 companies, including BBC, DocuSign, Electronic Arts, Hyperloop One, Juniper Networks, Nvidia, Slack, and Visa, rely on npm to reduce friction and build amazing things.</p><p><strong>About working at npm</strong></p><p>npm is not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests who take both our careers and our lives seriously. The best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We focus on tools and sustainable processes rather than on individual heroics, and we value flexibility, continual process improvements, and scrappy problem solving.</p><p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California, but if you have experience working remotely, we are open to this. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p><p><strong><em>Closing date for applications is Friday, November 3, 2017</em></strong></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

The position reports to npm’s Vice President of Marketing in Oakland, California.<br><br><strong>About you</strong><br><br>You’re a creative, organized, and versatile generalist who will help keep the marketing machine humming. You’ll create and iterate on our marketing efforts, particularly advertising, email marketing, and our website funnel. Other moving parts include marketing automation, site optimization and analytics, blog and web content, search engine marketing, and ad tools.<br><br>We’re looking for prior experience in digital marketing, marketing operations, or marketing communications, but that’s not rigid. If you are curious, adaptable, and kind, you can get the hang of this. Other members of our marketing team have been an unsuccessful screenwriter and a bartender at a Cajun restaurant, and our CEO started his career selling vacuum cleaners. It takes all kinds.<br><br><strong>About npm</strong><br><br>npm is kind of a big deal. Over 9 million software developers worldwide use npm, Inc.’s open source software and web registry to discover, share, and reuse packages of code. Our users download over 550,000 packages more than 3 billion times per week, and registry downloads have grown by more than 16x in the last two years.<br><br>Our paid products and services offer teams and companies additional ways to organize, share, and secure code, integrate npm with testing and deployment tools, and bring code reuse into the enterprise. More than 100,000 companies, including BBC, DocuSign, Electronic Arts, Hyperloop One, Juniper Networks, Nvidia, Slack, and Visa, rely on npm to reduce friction and build amazing things.<br><br><strong>About working at npm</strong><br><br>npm is not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests who take both our careers and our lives seriously. The best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We focus on tools and sustainable processes rather than on individual heroics, and we value flexibility, continual process improvements, and scrappy problem solving.<br><br>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California, but if you have experience working remotely, we are open to this. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.<br><br><strong><em>Closing date for applications is Friday, November 3, 2017</em></strong></p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

Sound like something you are interested in? Read on.</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><span>A unique application and hiring process, just like us</span></h2><p><span>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>Our process reflects that. We’ve outlined our values and how we work above, and now we will ask you to complete a couple small tasks to show us you’re interested.</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><span>Create A Work Sample</span></h2><p><span>The following is a typical task you would be doing on a daily basis. Follow the steps below to see if this type of work interests you and is a good fit. Please do not spend more than an hour on this task, as it is intended for you to be able to demonstrate basic competency in the core part of the job you will be doing.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We want to know how you think about designing elegant product solutions focused around increasing conversions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Here is the website for one of our past clients: Hired.com. Hired spends a lot of money (e.g. through paid ads) to drive applicants, primarily software engineers, to their site. Their goal is to increase the number of leads/applicants that complete the signup flow and are ready to be hired.</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><span>Your first task is to come up with a hypothesis backlog of at least 6-8 ideas you have for improving conversions for the Hired.com. An example of a hypothesis is: “Adding a video to the Hired website will help job candidates understand how Hired works and therefore, increase conversions.”</span></p></li><li><p><span>Once you’ve developed your hypothesis backlog, choose one of the ideas that you believe is most likely to increase leads.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Write a spec for your chosen idea comprised of the user story, any supporting data, expected user or page interactions, engineering notes, etc. Optionally, you may also produce a wireframe and/or a visual to go along with your spec, using any number of UX tools such as Axure, Balsamiq, Invision or even simple pen/paper sketching. Just be sure to submit your spec as an image so anyone can view it without special software.</span></p></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>In a real-life client situation, you will work with the client to create a testing roadmap supported by data that aligns with the client’s KPI’s. You’ll then write a spec for the experiments, and will work with engineering to implement and QA the experiment. Once the test is implemented, you’ll run an A/B test, share the results with the client, draw insights from the test, and develop new ideas for testing.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> When you’ve completed your hypothesis backlog and spec, please send an email to tom@crometrics.com and chris@crometrics.com. In the email, include the following: + A paragraph that includes a description of prior A/B testing experience, a link to your LinkedIn profile, and the name of the town/city you live in. Note the job is open to us-based applicants only.+ Why you want the job, and a description of prior A/B testing experience+ Desired annual compensation range (to ensure we’re not wasting one another’s time – we’re not going to hold you to this number) and general availability+ The hypothesis/ideas backlog you created for Hired.com+ The spec/wireframe for one of your top hypotheses. Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for up to 2 weeks (20 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal. Thanks again for your interest in the Growth Product Manager position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>",

We won the South of England region in the ‘Best of Britain’ awards 2017, and are currently shortlisted for several awards: the UK Business Awards 2017 as ‘Disruptor of the Year’, and in the Best Women Awards 2017 as ‘Best New Business’, ‘Best Technology’ and ‘Best company working with children and families’.<br /><br />*About the Team*<br /><br />We have an informal, hard-working and kind team culture.<br /><br />Our founder is Rachel Carrell, the former CEO of DrThom.com, the world’s largest online doctor service, which she grew to over 1.3m paying users in 3 countries. She’s an Oxford alumn, ex-McKinsey, a Rhodes Scholar and a WEF Young Global Leader.<br /><br />Rachel’s joined by an amazing team with backgrounds including Cambridge, UCL, BCG, KPMG, and some of London’s top startups. We take great care with who we hire and all team members are superbly talented. If you’re brilliant AND humble, you’ll fit right in.<br /><br />We work from a beautiful co-working space near Old St in central London. The office has free snacks and drinks, a gym and showers, bike storage and a programme of social events.<br /><br />*About the role*<br /><br />We are growing really fast, and we need someone with a strong numerical/analyst background. Part of the role will involve supporting the Head of Operations on payroll and payments, which is a critical part of the business. Part of the role will also be wider operations, which includes helping with recruiting and matching nannies to families. Your day might be spent partly in Excel, partly in Google Sheets, partly in some other software that you suggest to us, partly emailing parents and nannies, and partly talking to them over the phone. You'll find the work is varied -- some of it will be quite repetitive and boring (although really important!), and some of it will be fascinating and exciting. <br /><br />You’ll have lots of freedom to reflect, analyse, experiment, innovate and improve the way we do things. You’ll be encouraged to think about human psychology, ‘nudges’, messaging and marketing, tracking and analysing data, algorithms and automation – all as part of the job as we improve the way matching works. We’ll welcome your ideas.<br /><br />You’ll get exposure to all other parts of the business including marketing, finance, and software. At times you might help out with tasks related to these things as well. You’ll be a core member of our team, and you’ll get all the training, coaching and support you need to do your job well. We’ll invest in your development and help you succeed.<br /><br />Your normal hours of work will be 830am to 6pm, although there may be times when late nights are required to cope with particular ‘spikes’ in demand. We know you have a private life and other commitments and we work as a team to make sure everyone has a good balance. You’ll normally work from our offices near Old St, although if you like to occasionally work from home that’s totally fine too.<br /><br />3 reasons this role is great:<br />*You will learn a TON. Customer-facing operations will be your main focus, but you’ll get plenty of exposure to marketing and other aspects of the business. You’ll learn how to found a business, about operations, marketing, technology, and finance. You’ll also be surrounded by other startups trying to grow. If you want to, you can get stuck into the London startup scene, with its evening meetups and events, which is incredibly dynamic and fun.<br />*You’ll be making a huge difference to the everyday lives of parents in London. We’re building a business that will profoundly benefit children, women, and families.<br />* We’re well-connected in the startup world, so working with us will open lots of doors for you even if you leave. We’ve got a strong track record of helping people we’ve worked with<br /><br />*About you*<br />We’re after an all-rounder who is clever, practical, positive and nice. We don’t mind what degree you’ve done, as long as you’ve done well in it -- but we'll be looking for something in your background that shows that you're strongly numerate. We’ll also be looking for evidence of drive, aspiration, spark and energy in the extracurricular stuff you’ve done.<br /><br />*Essential skills*<br />* You like working with numbers and data. We love people who love analysis<br />* You have fantastic attention to detail and an ability to get things 100% correct where it really matters -- like payroll and payments<br />* You’re comfortable speaking to new people, both in person and on the phone<br />* You’re able to write clearly, simply and accurately, with perfect spelling and grammar<br />* You can work at a fast pace and under pressure<br />* You’re emotionally intelligent. Although you’ll like to talk, the most important thing you’ll do is listen. Choosing childcare is an emotional decision, and you’ll need to help parents through the process<br />* You’re a problem-solver. As we are a young company, there aren’t many fixed processes yet. That means you can create new processes, make suggestions, and tell us we’re doing things wrong<br />* You roll with it. You understand that startups are unpredictable environments. You are comfortable with a degree of chaos<br />* You’re nice. You get that no player is bigger than the team. You fit right into our culture of supporting and helping each other.",
