Read on.</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><span>A unique application and hiring process, just like us</span></h2><p><span>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>Our process reflects that. We’ve outlined our values and how we work above, and now we will ask you to complete a couple small tasks to show us you’re interested.</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><span>Create A Work Sample</span></h2><p><span>The following is a typical task you would be doing on a daily basis. Follow the steps below to see if this type of work interests you and is a good fit. Please do not spend more than an hour on this task, as it is intended for you to be able to demonstrate basic competency in the core part of the job you will be doing.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We want to know how you think about designing elegant product solutions focused around increasing conversions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Here is the website for one of our past clients: Hired.com. Hired spends a lot of money (e.g. through paid ads) to drive applicants, primarily software engineers, to their site. Their goal is to increase the number of leads/applicants that complete the signup flow and are ready to be hired.</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><span>Your first task is to come up with a hypothesis backlog of at least 6-8 ideas you have for improving conversions for the Hired.com. An example of a hypothesis is: “Adding a video to the Hired website will help job candidates understand how Hired works and therefore, increase conversions.”</span></p></li><li><p><span>Once you’ve developed your hypothesis backlog, choose one of the ideas that you believe is most likely to increase leads.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Write a spec for your chosen idea comprised of the user story, any supporting data, expected user or page interactions, engineering notes, etc. Optionally, you may also produce a wireframe and/or a visual to go along with your spec, using any number of UX tools such as Axure, Balsamiq, Invision or even simple pen/paper sketching. Just be sure to submit your spec as an image so anyone can view it without special software.</span></p></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>In a real-life client situation, you will work with the client to create a testing roadmap supported by data that aligns with the client’s KPI’s. You’ll then write a spec for the experiments, and will work with engineering to implement and QA the experiment. Once the test is implemented, you’ll run an A/B test, share the results with the client, draw insights from the test, and develop new ideas for testing.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> When you’ve completed your hypothesis backlog and spec, please send an email to tom@crometrics.com and chris@crometrics.com. In the email, include the following: + A paragraph that includes a description of prior A/B testing experience, a link to your LinkedIn profile, and the name of the town/city you live in. Note the job is open to us-based applicants only.+ Why you want the job, and a description of prior A/B testing experience+ Desired annual compensation range (to ensure we’re not wasting one another’s time – we’re not going to hold you to this number) and general availability+ The hypothesis/ideas backlog you created for Hired.com+ The spec/wireframe for one of your top hypotheses. Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for up to 2 weeks (20 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal. Thanks again for your interest in the Growth Product Manager position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>",

Follow the steps below to see if this type of work interests you and is a good fit. Please do not spend more than an hour on this task, as it is intended for you to be able to demonstrate basic competency in the core part of the job you will be doing.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We want to know how you think about designing elegant product solutions focused around increasing conversions.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here is the website for one of our past clients: Hired.com. Hired spends a lot of money (e.g. through paid ads) to drive applicants, primarily software engineers, to their site. Their goal is to increase the number of leads/applicants that complete the signup flow and are ready to be hired.</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li><span>Your first task is to come up with a hypothesis backlog of at least 6-8 ideas you have for improving conversions for the Hired.com. An example of a hypothesis is: “Adding a video to the Hired website will help job candidates understand how Hired works and therefore, increase conversions.”</span><br><br></li><li><span>Once you’ve developed your hypothesis backlog, choose one of the ideas that you believe is most likely to increase leads.</span><br><br></li><li><span>Write a spec for your chosen idea comprised of the user story, any supporting data, expected user or page interactions, engineering notes, etc. Optionally, you may also produce a wireframe and/or a visual to go along with your spec, using any number of UX tools such as Axure, Balsamiq, Invision or even simple pen/paper sketching. Just be sure to submit your spec as an image so anyone can view it without special software.</span><br><br></li></ol><div><span>In a real-life client situation, you will work with the client to create a testing roadmap supported by data that aligns with the client’s KPI’s. You’ll then write a spec for the experiments, and will work with engineering to implement and QA the experiment. Once the test is implemented, you’ll run an A/B test, share the results with the client, draw insights from the test, and develop new ideas for testing.</span></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>When you’ve completed your hypothesis backlog and spec, please send an email to <a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a> and <a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>. In the email, include the following:A paragraph that includes a description of prior A/B testing experience, a link to your LinkedIn profile, and the name of the town/city you live in. Note the job is open to us-based applicants only.; Desired annual compensation range (to ensure we’re not wasting one another’s time – we’re not going to hold you to this number) and general availability; The hypothesis/ideas backlog you created for Hired.com; The spec/wireframe for one of your top hypotheses. Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for up to 2 weeks (20 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal. Thanks again for your interest in the Growth Product Manager position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>  </div>",

Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.<br></p><p>As a Product Manager at CROmetrics, you will be a hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to partner with our clients to improve their websites through data-driven experimentation and personalization. A Product Manager spends much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, the PM must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites.<br>As a PM, you will be leading all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:<br></p><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation<br></li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment<br></li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution<br></li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics<br>In addition, as a CROmetrics team member, you will:<br></li><li>Support the professional growth of the team through leading and/or participating in ongoing training, e.g. book club<br></li><li>Engage in non-client related activities that help grow our business, e.g. writing the PM job description or delivering hypotheses and mock-ups for a sales deck<br></li><li>Actively participate in our remote culture<br><p>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:<br></p></li><li>5+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on consumer-facing web products<br></li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills<br></li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas<br></li><li>Passion for using data to improve user experiences<br></li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically<br></li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity<br></li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups<br></li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution<br></li><li>Lifelong learner<br>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here <a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>to learn more about the team.</a><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email chris@crometrics.com or tom@crometrics.com.</em><br></li><li><strong>We’re a remote company.</strong> We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.<br></li><li><strong>Our engineers value elegant code, but move fast.</strong> We’re writing code that runs on top of existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). If “minimum viable product” isn’t in your lexicon, you aren’t a good fit.<br></li><li><strong>Communication is critical.</strong> We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension — extremely important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes, improving processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.<br></li><li><strong>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.</strong> The PM is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the PMs have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!<br></li><li><strong>We are not perfect.</strong> A the core of experimentation is the lesson to be learned from the test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by setting the bar high for our team and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.<br>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by: This is Professionalism: <a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/</a><em>Sound like something you are interested in?

    "content": "*One Third Stories* is a high-growth start-up that inspires kids to love foreign languages. We do this by creating wonderful books that start in English and _end_ in a different language, delivered each month as part of a subscription box. We’re looking for an assistant product developer to come on board and help us make even more brilliant books and story boxes in the fast-paced world of a small start-up. <br /><br />One Third Stories was &quot;started by two friends as a passion project a few years back&quot;:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1405842914/learn-languages-through-stories/description. We’re still a small team, but these days we work with amazing illustrators, authors, translators, narrators and teachers to create good old-fashioned bedtime stories that give children access to the wonderful world of foreign languages. <br /><br />You might not have loads of experience in children’s publishing but you’ve got a good eye for what works and big ideas for the sort of books you want to make one day. You’re excited by getting involved with a whole new way of publishing and ready for the challenge of taking a project from an initial idea to a product that delights children and parents alike. <br /><br />*This job will be for you if…*<br /><br />- You’ve got a couple of years experience in the children's publishing industry but you’re a little fed up of being a small cog in big machine. <br /><br />- You’re one part daydreaming, story-scribbling free spirit and one part outrageously organised deadline deadeye. <br /><br />- You’ve got great written communication skills, an eye for design, and a really strong pun game. <br /><br />- Your attention to detail is putting a strain on some of your friendships because you keep printing out Whatsapp conversations and correcting them in red pen.<br /><br />- You’re interested in exploring new ways of telling a good story and keeping kids entertained. Podcasts? Videos? Puppet shows? You’re up for experimenting. <br /><br />- You love learning new things and don’t mind mucking in wherever another pair of hands is needed. <br /><br /><br />*You’ll be responsible for...*<br /><br />- Working closely with our Creative Director to shape our publishing plan, commission new titles, and influence the direction of One Third Stories’ entire product range. <br /><br />- Planning activities that are educational, entertaining and capable of keeping a six year old busy for hours. <br /><br />- Writing and editing copy for activity books, our website, adverts, blogs, blurbs, staff tattoos...you might even take a crack at writing the odd story yourself. <br /><br />- Liaising with authors, illustrators, translators, proofreaders, and graphic designers to ensure every Story Box is top quality, on schedule, and in budget. <br /><br />- Talking to our customers to find out how we can improve each of our story boxes before coming up with a plan to implement these changes before the next print run. <br /><br />- Good, clean, administrative fun including laying up books for print, managing freelancer contracts, triple-checking proofs, keeping up on industry trends, and organising creative assets. <br /><br /><br />*If you have this that would be great (but no worries if not)*<br /><br />- Some level of proficiency in another language, particularly French or Spanish. <br /><br />- Any experience working with children, especially in an educational setting.<br /><br />- A decent level of experience across the Adobe suite, particularly InDesign and Photoshop. <br /><br /><br />*What do you get?*<br /><br />- A budget allocated for you to learn anything you think might improve your performance or skillset.<br /><br />- Three ‘Duvet Days’ a month to work from home so you don’t have to worry about commuting when you don’t feel like leaving bed (or are a tad hungover).<br /><br />- You’ll be based out of an abandoned railway station in Camden Town (bohemian we know) with a bunch of other start-ups with the odd party here and there.<br /><br />- Competitive salary with the opportunity to grow rapidly and take on additional responsibilities.<br /><br /><br />*To apply, please email jonny@onethirdstories.com with your CV and a covering letter*",

    "content": "*About Koru Kids*<br /><br />Koru Kids is on a mission to improve childcare in London. We’re making it easier and more affordable for families to access flexible and high quality childcare, by helping them share nannies with other families. This helps bring down the cost of childcare for the parents, means the nanny gets paid more, and gives the children a new friend to play with. Parents have responded enthusiastically, and our network of families is growing very fast.<br /><br />We are backed by fantastic investors, including top venture capitalists and business angels such as Michael Pennington the founder of Gumtree. We won the South of England region in the ‘Best of Britain’ awards 2017, and are currently shortlisted for several awards: the UK Business Awards 2017 as ‘Disruptor of the Year’, and in the Best Women Awards 2017 as ‘Best New Business’, ‘Best Technology’ and ‘Best company working with children and families’.<br /><br />*About the Team*<br /><br />We have an informal, hard-working and kind team culture.<br /><br />Our founder is Rachel Carrell, the former CEO of DrThom.com, the world’s largest online doctor service, which she grew to over 1.3m paying users in 3 countries. She’s an Oxford alumn, ex-McKinsey, a Rhodes Scholar and a WEF Young Global Leader.<br /><br />Rachel’s joined by an amazing team with backgrounds including Cambridge, UCL, BCG, KPMG, and some of London’s top startups. We take great care with who we hire and all team members are superbly talented. If you’re brilliant AND humble, you’ll fit right in.<br /><br />We work from a beautiful co-working space near Old St in central London. The office has free snacks and drinks, a gym and showers, bike storage and a programme of social events.<br /><br />*About the role*<br /><br />We are growing really fast, and we need someone with a strong numerical/analyst background. Part of the role will involve supporting the Head of Operations on payroll and payments, which is a critical part of the business. Part of the role will also be wider operations, which includes helping with recruiting and matching nannies to families. Your day might be spent partly in Excel, partly in Google Sheets, partly in some other software that you suggest to us, partly emailing parents and nannies, and partly talking to them over the phone. You'll find the work is varied -- some of it will be quite repetitive and boring (although really important!), and some of it will be fascinating and exciting. <br /><br />You’ll have lots of freedom to reflect, analyse, experiment, innovate and improve the way we do things. You’ll be encouraged to think about human psychology, ‘nudges’, messaging and marketing, tracking and analysing data, algorithms and automation – all as part of the job as we improve the way matching works. We’ll welcome your ideas.<br /><br />You’ll get exposure to all other parts of the business including marketing, finance, and software. At times you might help out with tasks related to these things as well. You’ll be a core member of our team, and you’ll get all the training, coaching and support you need to do your job well. We’ll invest in your development and help you succeed.<br /><br />Your normal hours of work will be 830am to 6pm, although there may be times when late nights are required to cope with particular ‘spikes’ in demand. We know you have a private life and other commitments and we work as a team to make sure everyone has a good balance. You’ll normally work from our offices near Old St, although if you like to occasionally work from home that’s totally fine too.<br /><br />3 reasons this role is great:<br />*You will learn a TON. Customer-facing operations will be your main focus, but you’ll get plenty of exposure to marketing and other aspects of the business. You’ll learn how to found a business, about operations, marketing, technology, and finance. You’ll also be surrounded by other startups trying to grow. If you want to, you can get stuck into the London startup scene, with its evening meetups and events, which is incredibly dynamic and fun.<br />*You’ll be making a huge difference to the everyday lives of parents in London. We’re building a business that will profoundly benefit children, women, and families.<br />* We’re well-connected in the startup world, so working with us will open lots of doors for you even if you leave. We’ve got a strong track record of helping people we’ve worked with<br /><br />*About you*<br />We’re after an all-rounder who is clever, practical, positive and nice. We don’t mind what degree you’ve done, as long as you’ve done well in it -- but we'll be looking for something in your background that shows that you're strongly numerate. We’ll also be looking for evidence of drive, aspiration, spark and energy in the extracurricular stuff you’ve done.<br /><br />*Essential skills*<br />* You like working with numbers and data. We love people who love analysis<br />* You have fantastic attention to detail and an ability to get things 100% correct where it really matters -- like payroll and payments<br />* You’re comfortable speaking to new people, both in person and on the phone<br />* You’re able to write clearly, simply and accurately, with perfect spelling and grammar<br />* You can work at a fast pace and under pressure<br />* You’re emotionally intelligent. Although you’ll like to talk, the most important thing you’ll do is listen. Choosing childcare is an emotional decision, and you’ll need to help parents through the process<br />* You’re a problem-solver. As we are a young company, there aren’t many fixed processes yet. That means you can create new processes, make suggestions, and tell us we’re doing things wrong<br />* You roll with it. You understand that startups are unpredictable environments. You are comfortable with a degree of chaos<br />* You’re nice. You get that no player is bigger than the team. You fit right into our culture of supporting and helping each other.",
