The ByBox solution disrupted the market by increasing service while reducing cost for customers, so that it now dominates the UK market.</p><p>ByBox is now taking its technology globally by building on its already impressive software development team to build a technology team capable of delivering electronic box-based solutions to a global market. The ByBox suite of mobile, web, and client-based applications cover:</p><ul><li>Bluetooth electronic lockers</li><li>Multi-tenanted customer web-applications</li><li>End-user mobile applications</li><li>Logistics support &amp; label/barcode generation</li><li>Warehouse management systems</li><li>Customer-facing order portals</li><li>Customer and 3<sup>rd</sup>-party EDI</li><li>In-field mobile device and scanner solutions</li><li>Automated testing facilities</li><li>And much, much more</li></ul><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>ByBox requires an experienced, enthusiastic, and highly motivated Software professional to take on the new role of Technical Content Author at ByBox, in the Software Development department.

There will also be some travel to other sites in the UK, namely our facilities in Coventry and Milton Keynes. All technical team members are connected remotely and communication is fully established, effective and easy. Face to face meetings in any one of our offices can be arranged easily as and when required.</p><p>Although rare, some out of hours working may be required as part of understanding the different ByBox domains (particularly operational).</p><p><strong>The Person</strong></p><p>The successful candidate will be an experienced technical author/writer with the following experience and qualities:</p><ul><li>Background of working in Software Development teams creating software user documentation, user manuals, release notes, training courses / materials and other documents.</li><li>Outstanding written communication skills, with strong literacy, and a clear and concise writing style.</li><li>Creative, with a flair for turning technical subjects and jargon into easily understood content or training material.</li><li>Be a clear and confident communicator; able to interact effectively with a distributed team of other technical experts and senior representatives.</li><li>Passion and aptitude in technology and technical techniques, particularly content authoring tools.</li><li>Be enthusiastic and pro-active in learning the technologies and capabilities of ByBoxâ€™ existing software.</li><li>An exceptional eye for detail with a passion for accuracy.</li><li>Worked with both internal and external stakeholders to define suitable documentation requirements.</li><li>Be a clear and confident communicator; able to interact effectively with a distributed team of other technical experts and senior representatives.</li><li>Ability to lead and influence a variety of team members with the goal of fulfilling our documentation strategy.</li><li>Be self-motivated, positive, self-disciplined, reliable, trustful, honest and collaborative.</li><li>Capable of working effectively with minimal supervision.</li></ul><p><strong>Desirable qualifications and experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Qualifications in English, Communications, Computer Science, or other relevant subjects.</li><li>Experience in the logistics industry, or knowledge of the ByBox domain.</li><li>Experience working with agile software development methodologies.</li></ul><p><strong>Application Process:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Please apply in writing to the Recruitment Department including a covering letter and up to date CV</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p><p>External candidates will be required to supply details of two business referees in senior positions, who will be contacted by the Company after the first interview.

Now we’re at the forefront of recurring billing software, empowering thousands of entrepreneurs to sell their products as subscriptions, and processing tens of millions of dollars in sales every week.</p><p>In two years we’ve gone from a team of 3, to a team of 35 people across the world. Our culture is remote-first, so we stay connected every day using Slack and video chat.

The position reports to npm’s Vice President of Marketing in Oakland, California.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>You’re a creative, organized, and versatile generalist who will help keep the marketing machine humming. You’ll create and iterate on our marketing efforts, particularly advertising, email marketing, and our website funnel. Other moving parts include marketing automation, site optimization and analytics, blog and web content, search engine marketing, and ad tools.</p><p>We’re looking for prior experience in digital marketing, marketing operations, or marketing communications, but that’s not rigid. If you are curious, adaptable, and kind, you can get the hang of this. Other members of our marketing team have been an unsuccessful screenwriter and a bartender at a Cajun restaurant, and our CEO started his career selling vacuum cleaners. It takes all kinds.</p><p><strong>About npm</strong></p><p>npm is kind of a big deal. Over 9 million software developers worldwide use npm, Inc.’s open source software and web registry to discover, share, and reuse packages of code. Our users download over 550,000 packages more than 3 billion times per week, and registry downloads have grown by more than 16x in the last two years.</p><p>Our paid products and services offer teams and companies additional ways to organize, share, and secure code, integrate npm with testing and deployment tools, and bring code reuse into the enterprise. More than 100,000 companies, including BBC, DocuSign, Electronic Arts, Hyperloop One, Juniper Networks, Nvidia, Slack, and Visa, rely on npm to reduce friction and build amazing things.</p><p><strong>About working at npm</strong></p><p>npm is not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests who take both our careers and our lives seriously. The best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We focus on tools and sustainable processes rather than on individual heroics, and we value flexibility, continual process improvements, and scrappy problem solving.</p><p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California, but if you have experience working remotely, we are open to this. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p><p><strong><em>Closing date for applications is Friday, November 3, 2017</em></strong></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>Our process reflects that. We’ve outlined our values and how we work above, and now we will ask you to complete a couple small tasks to show us you’re interested.</span></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><span>Create A Work Sample</span></h2><p><span>The following is a typical task you would be doing on a daily basis. Follow the steps below to see if this type of work interests you and is a good fit. Please do not spend more than an hour on this task, as it is intended for you to be able to demonstrate basic competency in the core part of the job you will be doing.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We want to know how you think about designing elegant product solutions focused around increasing conversions.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Here is the website for one of our past clients: Hired.com. Hired spends a lot of money (e.g. through paid ads) to drive applicants, primarily software engineers, to their site. Their goal is to increase the number of leads/applicants that complete the signup flow and are ready to be hired.</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li><p><span>Your first task is to come up with a hypothesis backlog of at least 6-8 ideas you have for improving conversions for the Hired.com. An example of a hypothesis is: “Adding a video to the Hired website will help job candidates understand how Hired works and therefore, increase conversions.”</span></p></li><li><p><span>Once you’ve developed your hypothesis backlog, choose one of the ideas that you believe is most likely to increase leads.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Write a spec for your chosen idea comprised of the user story, any supporting data, expected user or page interactions, engineering notes, etc. Optionally, you may also produce a wireframe and/or a visual to go along with your spec, using any number of UX tools such as Axure, Balsamiq, Invision or even simple pen/paper sketching. Just be sure to submit your spec as an image so anyone can view it without special software.</span></p></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>In a real-life client situation, you will work with the client to create a testing roadmap supported by data that aligns with the client’s KPI’s. You’ll then write a spec for the experiments, and will work with engineering to implement and QA the experiment. Once the test is implemented, you’ll run an A/B test, share the results with the client, draw insights from the test, and develop new ideas for testing.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> When you’ve completed your hypothesis backlog and spec, please send an email to tom@crometrics.com and chris@crometrics.com. In the email, include the following: + A paragraph that includes a description of prior A/B testing experience, a link to your LinkedIn profile, and the name of the town/city you live in. Note the job is open to us-based applicants only.+ Why you want the job, and a description of prior A/B testing experience+ Desired annual compensation range (to ensure we’re not wasting one another’s time – we’re not going to hold you to this number) and general availability+ The hypothesis/ideas backlog you created for Hired.com+ The spec/wireframe for one of your top hypotheses. Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for up to 2 weeks (20 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal. Thanks again for your interest in the Growth Product Manager position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>",

Once the test is implemented, you’ll run an A/B test, share the results with the client, draw insights from the test, and develop new ideas for testing.</span></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>When you’ve completed your hypothesis backlog and spec, please send an email to <a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a> and <a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>. In the email, include the following:A paragraph that includes a description of prior A/B testing experience, a link to your LinkedIn profile, and the name of the town/city you live in. Note the job is open to us-based applicants only.; Desired annual compensation range (to ensure we’re not wasting one another’s time – we’re not going to hold you to this number) and general availability; The hypothesis/ideas backlog you created for Hired.com; The spec/wireframe for one of your top hypotheses. Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal. Thanks again for your interest in the Growth Product Manager position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>  </div>",

Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.<br></p><p>As a Product Manager at CROmetrics, you will be a hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to partner with our clients to improve their websites through data-driven experimentation and personalization. A Product Manager spends much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, the PM must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites.<br>As a PM, you will be leading all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:<br></p><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation<br></li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment<br></li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution<br></li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics<br>In addition, as a CROmetrics team member, you will:<br></li><li>Support the professional growth of the team through leading and/or participating in ongoing training, e.g. book club<br></li><li>Engage in non-client related activities that help grow our business, e.g. writing the PM job description or delivering hypotheses and mock-ups for a sales deck<br></li><li>Actively participate in our remote culture<br><p>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:<br></p></li><li>5+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on consumer-facing web products<br></li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills<br></li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas<br></li><li>Passion for using data to improve user experiences<br></li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically<br></li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity<br></li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups<br></li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution<br></li><li>Lifelong learner<br>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here <a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>to learn more about the team.</a><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email chris@crometrics.com or tom@crometrics.com.</em><br></li><li><strong>We’re a remote company.</strong> We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.<br></li><li><strong>Our engineers value elegant code, but move fast.</strong> We’re writing code that runs on top of existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). If “minimum viable product” isn’t in your lexicon, you aren’t a good fit.<br></li><li><strong>Communication is critical.</strong> We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension — extremely important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes, improving processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.<br></li><li><strong>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.</strong> The PM is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the PMs have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!<br></li><li><strong>We are not perfect.</strong> A the core of experimentation is the lesson to be learned from the test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by setting the bar high for our team and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.<br>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by: This is Professionalism: <a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/</a><em>Sound like something you are interested in?
