Right now, we have a solid platform, are are looking to accelerate our Data Science offerings to detect and trend new types of attacks.   <br /><br />Based in the heart of Bristol, we have great connections with the Cyber community across the region, and our office is just 2 minutes from Bristol Temple Meads station.<br /><br />We have an Innovate UK grant to boost development, and are looking for the right team member to take our Data Science to the next level.  The ideal candidate should be smart and keen.  From a technical perspective, they should have at least 3 years of experience in the field of Data Science, preferably using Python-based toolsets.  However, we're 100% Agile, so are open to different approaches.

    "content": "Elon Musk ran a nightclub. Counter-Strike was a Half-Life mod. Octocat was a kitten (possibly). What we’re saying, essentially, is everyone has to start somewhere.<br /><br />So, this is a junior data analyst position. You won’t handle multimillion-worth clients, you won’t have your own office and you’ll be making your own coffee.<br /><br />But wait: did we mention the salary is up to £25,000 with benefits including remote working one or two days per week? that we’ll nurture you and train you up to be a top-drawer software engineer or data scientist? that we’ve been in business for over ten years, are firm believers in collaboration (talk to us about pair programming) and are a friendly, sociable bunch?<br /><br />If that sounds good - and we figure it does else you’d have stopped reading by now - let us introduce ourselves.<br /><br />We’re a market insight, business intelligence and analytics boutique. Our clients are demanding more data granularity and in-depth analytics than ever before, so you’ll need some basic SQL skills to begin with. There’s truckloads of terabytes to manipulate and make sense of. If you’re as savvy as Sherlock and as brave as Bear Grylls, you’ll be fine.<br /><br />Our core tech stack is the C# .NET MVC SQL Server ecosystem with side helpings of Azure, Angular and NodeJS. We’ve got a number of interesting IoT projects on the go which offer a chance to marry hardware and software. So this position is perfecto if you’re interested in connected devices and embedded programming.<br /><br />It's a small team, so we need you to be friendly and adaptable. There’ll be frequent interruptions and distractions – and, from time to time, we’ll want you working on stuff outside your regular role.<br /><br />So show us some of your achievements, tell us what makes you tick and why we need you on our side, and we’ll do our best to take you to the top.We look forward to hearing from you. And remember you don't fish without a hook. No CVs without a cover letter, please.",

Ideas are developed by the whole team, from interns to seniors.</p><p>Equally, our clients pass the &quot;nice to work for&quot; test (and usually do so with flying colours). As part of that, we try to understand the ethical implications of the work we undertake. We seek to do the best we can for each other, for our profession, clients, and for the world at large. With no external investors, endjin has been built as a sustainable, lifelong business: we are a company to retire out of, not exit at the expense of the employees.</p><p>You can work remotely from anywhere in the UK, with hubs in Cambridge, Reading, Hampshire and London. We hold meet-ups in London on a regular basis. You design your ideal working environment, and we will make it happen together.</p><p>Apart from a real passion for learning, you know a couple of programming languages pretty well (we do a lot of C# and Typescript, but you may know R, or Python too). You love working with other people, but value the opportunity to spend time in your own head, thinking things through.</p><p>You can learn more about our projects at <a href='https://endjin.com' rel='nofollow'>https://endjin.com</a>, see a video about our career development pathways <a href='https://vimeo.com/200191869' rel='nofollow'>https://vimeo.com/200191869</a> or read our blog <a href='https://blogs.endjin.com' rel='nofollow'>https://blogs.endjin.com</a></p><p>Contact us on hello-at-endjin-dot-com if you think this looks like a good opportunity for you.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>React &amp; React Native</span><br><br></li><li><span>Swift &amp; Objective C</span><br><br></li><li><span>Elixir, &nbsp;Phoenix, and Nerves</span><br><br></li><li><span>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</span><br><br></li><li><span>Ethereum / Solidity</span><br><br></li><li><span>Ruby on Rails</span><br><br></li><li><span>Python</span><br><br></li><li><span>Pandas</span><br><br></li><li><span>Serverless</span><br><br></li><li><span>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</span><br></li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks.

Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>How We Operate</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are believers in transparency and openness.
