As users interact, anonymous data from these improved interactions is presented to the event organiser so they can better understand the composition and quality of the event, giving them the tools to improve event by event as well as quantitatively market the engagement of their event over other conferences.Hiver was a part of London Business School and Deloitte Incubator and of Google Best in British Campus Exchange as is now a member of the Entrepreneurial Spark London Hub.<br /><br />Learn more at www.hivertech.com <br /><br />No agencies please.",

We're all self-taught engineers, data scientists, and marketers, and we're eager to help others take the same journey that we did.

introductory phone call and if it sounds like there’s a match we'll arrange for you to meet the team for a full interview. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The interview process lasts several hours and is sometimes split across two days. &nbsp;It is intended to be challenging - but the developers you meet and the topics you’ll be asked to explain (and code!) should give you a very clear sense of what it would be like to work at Selerity. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We value different perspectives and have built a team that reflects that diversity while maintaining the highest standards of

We’re flexible, so even if you primarily work with C# or any other languages, but have experience developing web applications, send us your CV! :)</p><p>Although based in Australia, Avant8 has presence in the US and leverages it to deal with domestic brands and investors, specializing in turning around their distressed digital assets. Our team creates innovative solutions that work well under pressure allowing for new business models to tested rapidly in any market.</p><p>We’re looking for A-players, and part of that involves autonomy. You will be assigned tasks, both small and large, and a general time frame, but given the autonomy and freedom to schedule your own daily tasks as long as you complete what needs to get done. We understand and respect that you know development better than we do and it’s not our place to call unnecessarily strict or irrational deadlines and ways of completing tasks. This may be a good place to add that you should, when applying, mention in the cover letter your favorite food and, if you’re feeling ambitious, include a picture: this is to weed out applicants who mindlessly apply en masse to listings.</p><p>Given the above mentioned autonomy and freedom, you will be expected to debrief with a daily summary of what was accomplished, problems you ran into, what’s planned for the coming days, and maybe a joke or two. :)</p><p>We are a fun, friendly, and closely knit team, and although geographically distant, we have a strong work ethos and communicate regularly allowing for a very friendly and efficient work environment. Being a part of a new division within an established company, you get the best of both worlds in terms of job security and company culture. We work hard and expect the same from all of our team members.</p><p>We work hard, but we also play hard. You should come with a great sense of humor and a smile on your face, because you’ll have a few laughs and enjoy your time working with us.
