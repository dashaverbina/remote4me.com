    "title": "Very: Sr. Software Engineer Full Stack",
    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Remote or Chattanooga, TN)</strong> </p><p>Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.</p><p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p><p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p><p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p><p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p><p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p><p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p><ul><li><p>React &amp; React Native</p></li><li><p>Swift &amp; Objective C</p></li><li><p>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</p></li><li><p>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</p></li><li><p>Ethereum / Solidity</p></li><li><p>Ruby on Rails</p></li><li><p>Python</p></li><li><p>Pandas</p></li><li><p>Serverless</p></li><li><p>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</p></li></ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p><p><strong>This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong></p><p>As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks. This job is a great fit for pragmatic polyglot programmers with a functional bend. Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects and are at the tail end of moving to Elixir for the bulk of our services. Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.</p><p>We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.</p><p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p><p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a <a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>holacracy</a>. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to <a href='http://www.extremeprogramming.org/' rel='nofollow'>Extreme Programming</a> as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p><p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC—prices and plans vary based on your region—as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life &amp; AD&amp;D. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company’s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.</p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in the continental United States. Thanks!To apply, please send us a note to jobs-aj@verypossible.com with &quot;Sr. Software Engineer Full Stack&quot; in the subject line. Please include the following:1. What’s most important to you from a company culture and operating environment?2.

While these are required as foundational languages, being the first and primary developer for the projects you will be working on, you can enjoy the flexibility of working with any framework. We’re flexible, so even if you primarily work with C# or any other languages, but have experience developing web applications, send us your CV! :)</p><p>Although based in Australia, Avant8 has presence in the US and leverages it to deal with domestic brands and investors, specializing in turning around their distressed digital assets. Our team creates innovative solutions that work well under pressure allowing for new business models to tested rapidly in any market.</p><p>We’re looking for A-players, and part of that involves autonomy. You will be assigned tasks, both small and large, and a general time frame, but given the autonomy and freedom to schedule your own daily tasks as long as you complete what needs to get done. We understand and respect that you know development better than we do and it’s not our place to call unnecessarily strict or irrational deadlines and ways of completing tasks. This may be a good place to add that you should, when applying, mention in the cover letter your favorite food and, if you’re feeling ambitious, include a picture: this is to weed out applicants who mindlessly apply en masse to listings.</p><p>Given the above mentioned autonomy and freedom, you will be expected to debrief with a daily summary of what was accomplished, problems you ran into, what’s planned for the coming days, and maybe a joke or two. :)</p><p>We are a fun, friendly, and closely knit team, and although geographically distant, we have a strong work ethos and communicate regularly allowing for a very friendly and efficient work environment. Being a part of a new division within an established company, you get the best of both worlds in terms of job security and company culture. We work hard and expect the same from all of our team members.</p><p>We work hard, but we also play hard. You should come with a great sense of humor and a smile on your face, because you’ll have a few laughs and enjoy your time working with us.

You will help develop pilots, projects and services for our customers, hosted on Linux using&nbsp;<em>Kubernetes</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Google Cloud Platform</em>. The majority of these projects are related to&nbsp;<em>artificial intelligence</em>,&nbsp;<em>machine learning</em>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<em>data science</em>, while some are related to&nbsp;<em>web crawling</em>.</p><p>You can take on and finish tasks with a large degree of independence. As we are still a small and growing company (eight developers per January 2018), you need to have a broad technical competence and be flexible about your projects.</p><p>Each project usually have two developers working as a mini-team, but we communicate about challenges with everyone. We need both people skilled in putting code into production and those who specialize in ML, but for us it is important that everyone can code. For this position the actual Python programming is the important part.&nbsp;You make us extra happy if you have data science experience, a strong AI/ML background and/or statistical knowledge, but this is not required.</p><p>Recently we have worked on projects including speech to text, video OCR, text based recommendation systems, price prediction, a customer support mail-bot and generally a lot of fun and open ended challenges with a high success rate.</p><p>We offer a large degree of freedom. Pick your own equipment, OS, IDE, etc. You can choose to work from home. We offer a bonus and pension program. You will be working in a pleasant environment with other highly skilled Python programmers and machine learning experts.</p><p>Our developers can currently choose to work from home up to three days a week. So far we have preferred to meet in person to discuss projects now and then, but we are interested in working with full time remote developers as well.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Tenfifty AB            </h2>            <div><p>We are all about putting cutting edge machine learning into production and real use for our clients.</p><p>As of January 2018 we are a growing team of eight developers who work on (mostly) machine learning projects. We specialize in doing customized AI and ML solutions, often based on our existing code platform, that go beyond the &quot;fun pilot&quot;-stage and deliver real value. Usually we do a pilot to determine quality and feasibility, followed by a main project where we put models, etc into production, offered as a subscription service.</p><p>Many&nbsp;of us have well over a decade of experience doing Python and machine learning in practice, with solid mathematical and programming background. We always try to stay on the cutting edge, hosting and attending ML-meetups and seminars, reading papers, etc. In our projects we balance new&nbsp;methods that are fun/important to learn with more mature methods that we know will work in practice.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Flexible hours                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible location                            </div>                            <div>                                 Stock options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Fitness and health program                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pension program                            </div>                            <div>                                 Expert colleagues                            </div>                    ",
