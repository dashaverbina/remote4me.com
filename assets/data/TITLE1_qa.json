    "title": "Home Critic - Visiting and testing the top 1% of homes in London",
    "content": "Background<br /><br /><br />The Plum Guide is building a marketplace of the world’s best holiday homes. For real!<br /><br /><br />We are taking a systematic and obsessive approach to testing every single home on the planet, and accepting only the top 1%.<br /><br /><br />We do so by putting every home through The Plum Test: a gruelling hospitality exam, which uses a mix of algorithms and physical visits by hospitality experts.<br /><br /><br />We launched 2 years ago in London. Since, we have grown at 20% month on month, vetted over 80,000 homes and reached over £11m in annualised sales. We are backed by an all-star cast investor group including Local Globe (TransferWise, OneFineStay, Citymapper), Alex Chesterman (Founder of Zoopla), William Reeve (Founder of Love Film), Alex Saint and Troy Collins (Founders of Secret Escapes), Errol Damlin (Founder of Wonga), Jason Goodman (Founder of Albion) and many more.<br /><br /><br />We just closed our Series A round of funding. The objectives of this round are to take Plum global and continue to differentiate the brand and the experience for our guests and hosts.<br /><br /><br /><br />The Role<br /><br /><br />Home Critics are Plum’s superheroes. They put every home and host that applies through the Plum Home Test. This is how we guarantee the quality of every home in the collection.<br /><br /><br />You’ll visit the homes and conduct a 1.5-3 hours test, depending on the size of the home. You’ll interview the host, rate the home on over 150 criteria, create a floor plan and decide whether it passes or fails. You’ll then create the content that powers our beautiful listings.<br /><br /><br />This is a freelance position. Most Home Critics do between 2 and 6 tests a week – and we ask for at least 8 months’ commitment to apply.<br /><br /><br /><br />What you’ll be up to<br /><br /><br />- Visiting some of the most beautiful vacation homes in London.<br /><br /><br />- Meeting new hosts on each visit and interviewing them about their approach to hosting and the services they provide.<br /><br /><br />- Meticulously collecting information about the home and answering every question fully and diligently. This includes things like measuring shower pressure, checking thread-count and testing the decibel level and wifi signal.<br /><br /><br />- Creating a representative floor plan using software installed on an ipad.<br /><br /><br />- Building the content to create the listings. This includes: the summary description, the highlights, the home truths and the area recommendations (nearby restaurants, cafes, attractions etc.)<br /><br /><br />- Positioning each home for the right target market (e.g. families, couples, business people etc.)<br /><br /><br />- Giving the photographer and stylist guidance on what features to capture during the photoshoot.<br /><br /><br />- Deciding whether each home and host you visit qualifies to join the Plum collection in London.<br /><br /><br />- Providing feedback to the Plum HQ to improve the testing criteria and process.<br /><br /><br />- Building the Plum brand and culture in London and helping make our flagship city an even bigger success!<br /><br /><br /><br />Who we are looking for<br /><br /><br />We’re looking for bright, energetic and passionate people who love London. Get in touch if:<br /><br /><br />- You’re passionate about interiors and design, and have an opinion about what’s good enough and what isn’t. You can spot an Ikea-quality couch from a mile away and believe guests deserve better.<br /><br /><br />- You’re a people-person. You find meeting and getting to know new people easy and a pleasure, and regularly get told you make a great first impression.<br /><br /><br />- You have an excellent written ability and can write in descriptive detail to convey to the reader what a home or experience is like.<br /><br /><br />- You’re organised and always on time for appointments and meetings.<br /><br /><br />- You’re committed. You take responsibilities seriously and never miss deadlines or deliverables.<br /><br /><br />- You have exceptionally high standards. From food to art and fashion, you live and breathe design excellence and have an eye for it.<br /><br /><br />- You take pride in your work and wouldn’t dream of putting your name to something sub-standard.<br /><br /><br />- You’re empathetic and can put yourself in others’ shoes. You can imagine what’s important to guests, especially as tourists to your city.<br /><br /><br />- You’re a good judge of character and good at reading people. You could understand whether someone would be a caring and attentive host after a few hours.<br /><br /><br />- You’re a London expert. You’re always in the know about the best places to eat, must-see galleries and exhibitions, and the up-and-coming neighbourhoods.<br /><br /><br /><br />Why Be a Home Critic<br /><br /><br />- Learn about curation and hospitality. We’re building a unique and fascinating formula for the perfect stay based on art, science and data.<br /><br /><br />- Work flexibly! We don’t expect you to be in the office everyday (but we like it when you drop by). We send you to home tests and you can complete the listing from home or a café.<br /><br /><br />- Get paid to explore incredible homes – it’s a great way to top-up your income.<br />Explore your city and make connections with fascinating hosts.<br /><br /><br />- Be part of a passionate, friendly and transparent culture. We’re building an amazing place to work where everyone is learning and challenging themselves.<br /><br /><br />- Opportunities to grow into new roles. Some of our Home Critics in London have been recruited for office-based roles or special projects.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hours &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; compensation<br /><br /><br />You will be paid between £50 to £70 per test and listing creation, depending on the size of the home. We estimate each test and listing creation will take around 5 hours. This includes travel time to and from the visited homes if you’re based in London.",

(Want to see how we did? The links above highlight some of our work). And that’s not even including our family of WordPress plugins led by&nbsp;<a href='http://theeventscalendar.com/' rel='nofollow'>The Events Calendar</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>We’ve got a slew of cool projects we are working on in 2017, and need another member for our QA team. If working on high-profile sites for large clients gets you excited and a serious case of attention to detail is your jam, we should talk.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><b>Responsibilities</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>QA is responsible for ensuring all aspects of quality at Modern Tribe. It’s a tall order for sure: learning how a site works, creating test plans covering obscure use cases, and then putting it all into practice when testing every aspect of site functionality…it’s a lot of ground to cover. But we’ve got an established workflow down that helps make sure we’re setting the team up with the tools they need to proceed and succeed.</span></div><div>Though every project is different, here’s the gist of our QA flow:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>KICKOFF MEETING.</b>&nbsp;Just a kickoff — meet the PM; get your questions answered; set expectations; and schedule milestones.</li><li><b>PREPARING DOCS.</b>&nbsp;Getting started with internal documentation early is hugely important to getting the project into your brain.</li><li><b>REVIEW APPROVED COMPS.</b>&nbsp;Before you start QA or even get a walkthrough, you’ll review the comps to understand the project + prepare a list of questions to ask on the QA walkthrough.</li><li><b>QA WALKTHROUGH.</b>&nbsp;Once development is far enough along for QA to begin, you’ll do a walkthrough with the lead developer to get an overview of the functionality.</li><li><b>PREPARE QA CHECKLIST + TEST PLAN.</b>&nbsp;After seeing each component of the site in action, you’ll put together a first draft at a comprehensive QA checklist and a higher-level overview of what you’re planning to test, in what order, and when.</li><li><b>HEAVY DUTY TESTING.</b>&nbsp;You’ll put the site through its paces and give it a few rounds of full pass bug hunting. Beyond just hitting buttons, you’ll be thinking from a higher level: are there usability concerns? Does what we’re doing here actually make sense as the best way to solve the problem? etc.</li><li><b>CELEBRATING A SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH.</b>&nbsp;What feels better than kicking back after a successful launch? If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and — most importantly — the client will be happy. It doesn’t get much better than that.</li></ul><div>* Our QA team also generally leads client training and prepares training documentation/videos when appropriate, so be prepared for some direct client communication.</div><div><br></div><ul></ul><div></div><div><b>Personal Competencies&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><span>Extremely outgoing and friendly attitude</span></li><li><span>Strong communication     skills</span></li><li><span>Experience working as     part of a remote team</span></li><li><span>Self-motivated,     detail-oriented</span></li><li><span>Strong organizational     skills</span></li><li><span>A methodical approach     to all tasks</span></li><li><span>Ability to work on     multiple projects at the same time and complete tasks in a timely manner</span></li><li><span>Ability to prioritize     workloads and meet deadlines</span></li><li><span>Fluent English     speaker</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div></div><div><b>Knowledge &amp; Experience</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><span>Full time 100%     freelancers only!</span></li><li>Has a proven track record in Quality Assurance.</li><li>Pays meticulous attention to detail + fights for the customer. Being able to catch bugs is huge, but it isn’t everything — QA is most effective when it puts itself in the customer or end user’s shoes.</li><li>Knows WordPress well, you’ll be expected to prove your familiarity with the platform.</li><li>Excellent verbal, non-verbal and written communication skills</li><li>Has 1+ year remote freelancing experience.</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><b>Bonus Points</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li>Familiarity setting up local WordPress environments + cloning GIT repositories locally</li><li>Skills at training others how to admin complex WordPress sites/projects</li><li>Experience writing and implementing automated testing processes</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><b>Compensation</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Our hourly rate for this gig starts at&nbsp;</span><span>$25-$35/hr</span><span>, depending on experience, with opportunities for rate bumps on annual review. This gig is about 8 hours per week of work to start and ramping up to about 15 -20 hours over the next 2 -3 months. This is a one time contract position, though we are always seeking longer relationships with kick-ass people.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><b>Location</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Work from anywhere in the&nbsp;</span><span>US or Canada</span><span>; if you are in&nbsp;</span><span>Central or South America</span><span>, let’s talk.
