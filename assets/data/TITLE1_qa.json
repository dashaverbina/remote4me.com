If you haven't tested before, here are some key success factors:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>You read instructions and understand them. If the instructions say that something is out of scope and you test it, you’re wasting your own time.</li><li>You communicate precisely in English. Bug reporting is a particular form of communication that demands precision, concise wording, and logical ordering.</li><li>You are curious. The best testers aren’t robots who follow a script. They like things that seem mysterious. They deviate from the Happy Path. They like to experiment with apps.</li><li>You spot patterns. Similar bugs occur in unrelated software systems, so being able to sense patterns is very helpful.</li><li>You like games. There does seem to be a high degree of overlap between testers and gamers. Part of it is the thrill of the hunt, and the desire to understand the rules of a system and how to beat them.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>When you start as a tester at test IO, you'll get coaching from team leaders, then participate in test cycles with more experienced testers.
