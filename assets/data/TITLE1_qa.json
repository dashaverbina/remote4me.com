What makes us different is that we’re going after a big market that’s often overlooked by tech companies: industrial process data. Think pharmaceutical manufacturers, wind farms, and energy companies with tons of equipment and sensors. We’re applying a unique mix of technologies and a deep understanding of the problems faced by these industries to build and refine&nbsp;a product that's a huge&nbsp;leap over existing tools and methodologies.</p><p>Unlike roles with similar names at the other companies, Quality Engineers at Seeq aren't just manual testers. (<em>Everyone</em>&nbsp;pitches in to do manual testing.) You will understand our product to a level beyond most of your colleagues, and be the #1 advocate for quality. You will write testing scripts, advocate for testability, and create tools that the team can use to improve quality. You will navigate our codebase to identify weak spots and constantly design better and creative ways to break software and identify potential problems.</p><p>Our company is 100% remote.&nbsp;You can work anywhere in the US (we're staying in compatible timezones for now). We use a variety of collaboration tools, like&nbsp;<a href='http://www.zoom.us/' rel='nofollow'>Zoom</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://www.slack.com/' rel='nofollow'>Slack</a>, which makes us feel like we’re in the same building together. We have a stacked team of kind-hearted, talented engineers that love to collaborate, teach each other new tricks, and build products that far exceed our customers’ expectations.</p><h2>TECHNOLOGY STACK</h2><ul><li>Java / JVM languages</li><li>NoSQL databases (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, JanusGraph)</li><li>Node.js / AngularJS / TypeScript</li><li>Python</li></ul><h2>SKILLS &amp; REQUIREMENTS</h2><p>You love software and technology, and you love great software design. You know a well-written API when you see one.</p><p>You are constantly finding ways to perfect your craft, be a better teammate, and come up with cool stuff.</p><p>You’re disciplined with a high attention to detail. You evangelize unit testing, continuous integration, and elegant solutions. You have an uncanny knack for finding bugs.</p><p>You use your knowledge of testing and testability to influence better software design, promote proper engineering practice, bug prevention strategies, testability, accessibility, security, and other advanced quality concepts.</p><p>You learn things quickly.

What makes us different is that we’re going after a big market that’s often overlooked by tech companies: industrial process data. Think pharmaceutical manufacturers, wind farms, and energy companies with tons of equipment and sensors. We’re applying a unique mix of technologies and a deep understanding of the problems faced by these industries to build and refine&nbsp;a product that's a huge&nbsp;leap over existing tools and methodologies.</div><div><br></div><div>Unlike roles with similar names at the other companies, Quality Engineers at Seeq aren't just manual testers. (<em>Everyone</em>&nbsp;pitches in to do manual testing.) You will understand our product to a level beyond most of your colleagues, and be the #1 advocate for quality. You will write testing scripts, advocate for testability, and create tools that the team can use to improve quality. You will navigate our codebase to identify weak spots and constantly design better and creative ways to break software and identify potential problems.</div><div><br></div><div>Our company is 100% remote.&nbsp;You can work anywhere in the US (we're staying in compatible timezones for now). We use a variety of collaboration tools, like&nbsp;<a href='http://www.zoom.us/' rel='nofollow'>Zoom</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://www.slack.com/' rel='nofollow'>Slack</a>, which makes us feel like we’re in the same building together. We have a stacked team of kind-hearted, talented engineers that love to collaborate, teach each other new tricks, and build products that far exceed our customers’ expectations.</div><div><br></div><div><h2>TECHNOLOGY STACK</h2></div><ul><li>Java / JVM languages</li><li>NoSQL databases (Cassandra, Elasticsearch, JanusGraph)</li><li>Node.js / AngularJS / TypeScript</li><li>Python</li></ul><div><h2>SKILLS &amp; REQUIREMENTS</h2></div><div>You love software and technology, and you love great software design. You know a well-written API when you see one.</div><div><br></div><div>You are constantly finding ways to perfect your craft, be a better teammate, and come up with cool stuff.</div><div><br></div><div>You’re disciplined with a high attention to detail. You evangelize unit testing, continuous integration, and elegant solutions. You have an uncanny knack for finding bugs.</div><div><br></div><div>You use your knowledge of testing and testability to influence better software design, promote proper engineering practice, bug prevention strategies, testability, accessibility, security, and other advanced quality concepts.</div><div><br></div><div>You learn things quickly. You’re usually the one suggesting new technologies and raising the bar for the whole team. You listen really well, and you know how to make your ideas be heard without turning people off.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ve got a Bachelor’s, Masters or PhD in Computer Science or Engineering.</div><div><br></div><div>You want to work with the tech stack we listed above, and on cloud platforms like EC2/GCE/Azure.

In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, or New York.&nbsp;Applications will be accepted through January 15, 2018* _</h4><h4>What We Do</h4><p>Simply put, we make websites easier to use. Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data.</p><p>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></p><h4>Our Hiring Process</h4><p>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</p><p>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!</p><p>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>. Please read it and if you’re willing to work this way, read on!</p><p><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:matthew.gossage@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>matthew.gossage@crometrics.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></p><h4>Our Culture</h4><ul><li>We’re a remote company.&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li>We work hard and move fast.&nbsp;We’re working on a lot of different websites with varying underlying technologies. You’ll see a lot of pages and forms and there’s not a lot of automation. Maintaining quality while working on so much requires more than just checking boxes, you’ll need to think critically.</li><li>Again, we’re a remote company.&nbsp;That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li></ul></div></div><div></div></div></div></div>",

In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, or New York.&nbsp;<i>Applications will be accepted through January 15, 2018</i>*</em><br></h4></div><div><h4>What We Do</h4></div><div>Simply put, we make websites easier to use. Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><h4>Our Hiring Process</h4></div><div>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</div><div><br></div><div>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!</div><div><br></div><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>. Please read it and if you’re willing to work this way, read on!</div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:matthew.gossage@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>matthew.gossage@crometrics.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com&nbsp;</a>or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Our Culture</h4></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li><span>We work hard and move fast.&nbsp;</span>We’re working on a lot of different websites with varying underlying technologies. You’ll see a lot of pages and forms and there’s not a lot of automation. Maintaining quality while working on so much requires more than just checking boxes, you’ll need to think critically.</li><li><span><span>Again, we’re a remote company.</span>&nbsp;That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</span></li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Interested in working with us? You’re off to a good start.

    "title": "Home Critic - Visiting &amp; testing London's best homes and hosts",
    "content": "Background<br /><br />The Plum Guide is building a marketplace of the world’s best holiday homes. For real!<br /><br />We are taking a systematic and obsessive approach to testing every single home on the planet, and accepting only the top 1%.<br /><br />We do so by putting every home through The Plum Test: a gruelling hospitality exam, which uses a mix of algorithms and physical visits by hospitality experts.<br /><br />We launched 20 months ago in London. Since then, we have grown at 20% month on month, vetted over 80,000 homes and are on track to reach over £10m in annualised sales! We are backed by an all-star cast investor group including Local Globe (TransferWise, OneFineStay, Citymapper), Alex Chesterman (Founder of Zoopla), William Reeve (Founder of Love Film), Alex Saint and Troy Collins (Founders of Secret Escapes), Errol Damlin (Founder of Wonga), Jason Goodman (Founder of Albion) and many more.<br /><br />We are currently closing our Series A round of funding. The objectives of this round are to take Plum global and continue to differentiate the brand and the experience for our guests and hosts. <br /><br /><br />The Role<br /><br />Home Critics are Plum’s superheroes.  They put every home and host that applies through the Plum Home Test. This is how we guarantee the quality of every home in the collection.<br /><br />You’ll visit the homes and conduct a 1.5-3 hours test, depending on the size of the home. You’ll interview the host, rate the home on over 150 criteria, create a floor plan and decide whether it passes or fails. You’ll then create the content that powers our beautiful listings.<br /><br />This is a freelance position. Most Home Critics do between 2 and 6 tests a week – and we ask for at least 8 months’ commitment to apply.<br /><br /><br />What you’ll be up to<br /><br />- Visiting some of the most beautiful vacation homes in London.<br /><br />- Meeting new hosts on each visit and interviewing them about their approach to hosting and the services they provide.<br /><br />- Meticulously collecting information about the home and answering every question fully and diligently. This includes things like measuring shower pressure, checking thread-count and testing the decibel level and wifi signal.<br /><br />- Creating a representative floor plan using software installed on an ipad.<br /><br />- Building the content to create the listings. This includes: the summary description, the highlights, the home truths and the area recommendations (nearby restaurants, cafes, attractions etc.)<br /><br />- Positioning each home for the right target market (e.g. families, couples, business people etc.)<br /><br />- Giving the photographer and stylist guidance on what features to capture during the photoshoot.<br /><br />- Deciding whether each home and host you visit qualifies to join the Plum collection in London.<br /><br />- Providing feedback to the Plum HQ to improve the testing criteria and process.<br /><br />- Building the Plum brand and culture in London and helping make our flagship city an even bigger success!<br /><br /><br />Who we are looking for<br /><br />We’re looking for bright, energetic and passionate people who love London. Get in touch if:<br /><br />- You’re passionate about interiors and design, and have an opinion about what’s good enough and what isn’t. You can spot an Ikea-quality couch from a mile away and believe guests deserve better.<br /><br />- You’re a people-person. You find meeting and getting to know new people easy and a pleasure, and regularly get told you make a great first impression.<br /><br />- You have an excellent written ability and can write in descriptive detail to convey to the reader what a home or experience is like.<br /><br />- You’re organised and always on time for appointments and meetings.<br /><br />- You’re committed. You take responsibilities seriously and never miss deadlines or deliverables.<br /><br />- You have exceptionally high standards. From food to art and fashion, you live and breathe design excellence and have an eye for it.<br /><br />- You take pride in your work and wouldn’t dream of putting your name to something sub-standard.<br /><br />- You’re empathetic and can put yourself in others’ shoes. You can imagine what’s important to guests, especially as tourists to your city.<br /><br />- You’re a good judge of character and good at reading people. You could understand whether someone would be a caring and attentive host after a few hours.<br /><br />- You’re a London expert. You’re always in the know about the best places to eat, must-see galleries and exhibitions, and the up-and-coming neighbourhoods.<br /><br /><br />Why Be a Home Critic<br /><br />- Learn about curation and hospitality. We’re building a unique and fascinating formula for the perfect stay based on art, science and data. <br /><br />- Work flexibly! We don’t expect you to be in the office everyday (but we like it when you drop by). We send you to home tests and you can complete the listing from home or a café.<br /><br />- Get paid to explore incredible homes - it’s a great way to top-up your income.<br />Explore your city and make connections with fascinating hosts.<br /><br />- Be part of a passionate, friendly and transparent culture. We’re building an amazing place to work where everyone is learning and challenging themselves.<br /><br />- Opportunities to grow into new roles. Some of our Home Critics in London have been recruited for office-based roles or special projects.<br /><br /><br />Hours &amp;amp;amp;amp; compensation<br /><br />You will be paid between £50 to £70 per test and listing creation, depending on the size of the home. We estimate each test and listing creation will take around 5 hours. This includes travel time to and from the visited homes if you’re based in London.",

    "title": "Home Critic - Visiting and testing London's best homes and hosts",
    "content": "Background<br /><br />The Plum Guide is building a marketplace of the world’s best holiday homes. For real!<br /><br />We are taking a systematic and obsessive approach to testing every single home on the planet, and accepting only the top 1%.<br /><br />We do so by putting every home through The Plum Test: a gruelling hospitality exam, which uses a mix of algorithms and physical visits by hospitality experts.<br /><br />We launched 20 months ago in London. Since, we have grown at 20% month on month, vetted over 80,000 homes and reached over £11m in annualised sales. We are backed by an all-star cast investor group including Local Globe (TransferWise, OneFineStay, Citymapper), Alex Chesterman (Founder of Zoopla), William Reeve (Founder of Love Film), Alex Saint and Troy Collins (Founders of Secret Escapes), Errol Damlin (Founder of Wonga), Jason Goodman (Founder of Albion) and many more.<br /><br />We just closed our Series A round of funding. The objectives of this round are to take Plum global and continue to differentiate the brand and the experience for our guests and hosts. <br /><br /><br />The Role<br /><br />Home Critics are Plum’s superheroes.  They put every home and host that applies through the Plum Home Test. This is how we guarantee the quality of every home in the collection.<br /><br />You’ll visit the homes and conduct a 1.5-3 hours test, depending on the size of the home. You’ll interview the host, rate the home on over 150 criteria, create a floor plan and decide whether it passes or fails. You’ll then create the content that powers our beautiful listings.<br /><br />This is a freelance position. Most Home Critics do between 2 and 6 tests a week – and we ask for at least 8 months’ commitment to apply.<br /><br /><br />What you’ll be up to<br /><br />- Visiting some of the most beautiful vacation homes in London.<br /><br />- Meeting new hosts on each visit and interviewing them about their approach to hosting and the services they provide.<br /><br />- Meticulously collecting information about the home and answering every question fully and diligently. This includes things like measuring shower pressure, checking thread-count and testing the decibel level and wifi signal.<br /><br />- Creating a representative floor plan using software installed on an ipad.<br /><br />- Building the content to create the listings. This includes: the summary description, the highlights, the home truths and the area recommendations (nearby restaurants, cafes, attractions etc.)<br /><br />- Positioning each home for the right target market (e.g. families, couples, business people etc.)<br /><br />- Giving the photographer and stylist guidance on what features to capture during the photoshoot.<br /><br />- Deciding whether each home and host you visit qualifies to join the Plum collection in London.<br /><br />- Providing feedback to the Plum HQ to improve the testing criteria and process.<br /><br />- Building the Plum brand and culture in London and helping make our flagship city an even bigger success!<br /><br /><br />Who we are looking for<br /><br />We’re looking for bright, energetic and passionate people who love London. Get in touch if:<br /><br />- You’re passionate about interiors and design, and have an opinion about what’s good enough and what isn’t. You can spot an Ikea-quality couch from a mile away and believe guests deserve better.<br /><br />- You’re a people-person. You find meeting and getting to know new people easy and a pleasure, and regularly get told you make a great first impression.<br /><br />- You have an excellent written ability and can write in descriptive detail to convey to the reader what a home or experience is like.<br /><br />- You’re organised and always on time for appointments and meetings.<br /><br />- You’re committed. You take responsibilities seriously and never miss deadlines or deliverables.<br /><br />- You have exceptionally high standards. From food to art and fashion, you live and breathe design excellence and have an eye for it.<br /><br />- You take pride in your work and wouldn’t dream of putting your name to something sub-standard.<br /><br />- You’re empathetic and can put yourself in others’ shoes. You can imagine what’s important to guests, especially as tourists to your city.<br /><br />- You’re a good judge of character and good at reading people. You could understand whether someone would be a caring and attentive host after a few hours.<br /><br />- You’re a London expert. You’re always in the know about the best places to eat, must-see galleries and exhibitions, and the up-and-coming neighbourhoods.<br /><br /><br />Why Be a Home Critic<br /><br />- Learn about curation and hospitality. We’re building a unique and fascinating formula for the perfect stay based on art, science and data. <br /><br />- Work flexibly! We don’t expect you to be in the office everyday (but we like it when you drop by). We send you to home tests and you can complete the listing from home or a café.<br /><br />- Get paid to explore incredible homes - it’s a great way to top-up your income.<br />Explore your city and make connections with fascinating hosts.<br /><br />- Be part of a passionate, friendly and transparent culture. We’re building an amazing place to work where everyone is learning and challenging themselves.<br /><br />- Opportunities to grow into new roles. Some of our Home Critics in London have been recruited for office-based roles or special projects.<br /><br /><br />Hours &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp; compensation<br /><br />You will be paid between £50 to £70 per test and listing creation, depending on the size of the home. We estimate each test and listing creation will take around 5 hours. This includes travel time to and from the visited homes if you’re based in London.",

Not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, or New York.</b></em></div><div><em><b><br></b></em></div><div><em><h4><b>What We Do</b></h4></em></div><div>Simply put, we make websites easier to use. Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><h4><b>Our Hiring Process</b></h4></div><div>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.

Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li><b>We work hard and move fast.</b>&nbsp;We’re working on a lot of different websites with varying underlying technologies. You’ll see a lot of pages and forms and there’s not a lot of automation. Maintaining quality while working on so much requires more than just checking boxes, you’ll need to think critically.</li><li><b><strong>Again, we’re a remote company.</strong>&nbsp;</b>That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Interested in working with us?

It’s a tall order for sure: learning how a site works, creating test plans covering obscure use cases, and then putting it all into practice when testing every aspect of site functionality…it’s a lot of ground to cover.

If QA has done their job, the project will launch smoothly, the team will have a finished product to show off, and — most importantly — the client will be happy.

So Richard set up Twickets as a service on Twitter, connecting<br />fans and allowing them to trade with each other at strictly no more than face value.<br />Today, Twickets is the largest fan-to-fan marketplace for face value tickets and connects fans<br />via both website and app (iOS and Android) across three continents.
