We’re here to change that, and we need your help.</p><p>We started out in 2010 with an email subscription form, a YouTube account, and a lot of scrambling to figure things out. Even with over 40,000 clients in 80 countries, pretty much everything about how we’ve built our company and marketed our products has been bootstrapped by a small group of deeply invested people wearing a lot of hats and learning as we went along. Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</p><p>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and <strong>we are looking for a Front-End WP Developer to join GMB, part-time to start</strong>. You’ll be part of a team that is helping to imagine and build new products — as well as improve existing ones.</p><h2>What will be your responsibilities?</h2><ul><li>Working directly with our graphic designer to bring new design to code</li><li>Update and improve existing front-end code</li><li>Potential to work on the next version of our app and be involved in styleguide and UI library creation</li></ul><h3>To do this job, you will need:</h3><ul><li>Experience bringing WordPress themes to code (HTML/CSS/JS)</li><li>Some sense or experience in UX design</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end tools (Gulp, Sass, etc.)</li><li>Experience using git and GitHub workflows</li><li>Familiarity with CSS methodology (SMACSS, BEM, etc.)</li><li>Bonus points for some back-end and API familiarity especially with regard to WordPress</li></ul><h3>Other Requirements &amp; Competencies</h3><ul><li>You’ve been following GMB for a while and understand what sets us apart from other fitness companies.</li><li>You are clear on the value you’ll bring to the team.</li><li>You know how to follow instructions and how to be creative – and how to choose between them.</li><li>You speak and read/write perfect English.</li><li>You have a sense of humor.</li><li>You always work to develop a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>.</li><li>You are good at self-managing.</li><li>You have a strong DIY ethic – know what you don’t know and what you can do about it.</li><li>You can make things happen.

We’re working to make the world a better place by teaching people to take control of what their bodies can do so they can contribute to their families and communities. We create options for exploration and self-expression.</p><p>And we work the way we practice. Like our idea of fitness and the way we deliver our programs, very little about the way we work is like what you’d find in a traditional company. Here’s how we exemplify autonomy at work:</p><p>&nbsp;<span>Work and Live Anywhere</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Set Your Own Schedule.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Create Your Own Role.</span></p><p>We also take care of our people. Building a great team with full autonomy requires more than just freedom; we thrive in an environment that supports development and growth… and we bet you will too. Some of the things we value and encourage are:&nbsp;<span>continuous learning</span>,&nbsp;<span>travel &amp; facetime</span>, as well as&nbsp;<span>time off</span>. Learn more about all our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits here</a>.</p><p>If you like what you’ve read so far, familiarize yourself with who we are and what we’re&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>about</a>&nbsp;before going any further. You should also listen to this interview with Andy about&nbsp;<a href='https://mixergy.com/interviews/gmb-fitness-with-andy-fossett/' rel='nofollow'>how we grew GMB</a>&nbsp;and what’s important to us.</p><p>Want to learn more about the smart, fun people you’ll be working with?

    "content": "Bikmo is an adventure sports technology company, with a simple mission to provide exceptional services that enable our customers to spend more time exploring the great outdoors.<br /><br />Focussing initially on insurance in the cycling sector, we're now live in the UK, Ireland, Germany and Austria and by utilising sector expertise, technology, a love for the sport and an open approach to data, we've won customers, partners, awards and 5-star reviews.<br /><br />We are searching for a technically excellent and self-starting full stack developer to join our CTO in developing the platform that will enable us to achieve this ambition. Rapid application development allows us to adapt to our customers' needs and stay one step ahead of the competition, so we're looking for an applicant with an agile and adaptive mind.<br /><br />Our ideal candidate would be one who has as much energy for adventure sports as they do coding - you can live and work in the heart of the Alps, the UK or where you choose.<br /><br />The role:<br /><br />You will be working on a number of existing applications, and aiding with the creation of new application as and when they are needed. Our applications use middleware stacks to allow efficient re-use of encapsulated code, and the rapid development and deployment of new systems and feature sets. As a startup, we are moving at a rapid pace and the successful candidate will need to be able to get up to speed quickly and work self-sufficiently.<br /><br />In our back-end work we follow PHP-fig standards where they apply. We check our code for 'mess' and standards before sharing with remote repos and other projects. We use the git-flow branching strategy, and code review via pull-request.<br /><br />In our front-end work we build templates in Twig which can be integrated into existing and new PHP server-side projects. Developers need to have a good understanding of how data can be provided from and delivered to the back-end application, through template rendering, form submission and API interaction. They need to be able to use composition and inheritance to implement an effective, efficient templating strategy.<br /><br />Valuable experience of using JS, and JQuery where appropriate, is essential to any of our front-end work. The developer should be able to manipulate the DOM to provide an exceptional user experience, and use application logic to interact with the back end application on-page.<br /><br />Benefits:<br /><br />This role is a full time role at 38 hours per week, Monday to Friday.<br /><br />The Bikmo HQ is based in Chester, but you do not need to be. Everyone in the Bikmo team works remotely to some degree. We also have offices in Innsbruck and Munich which you are welcome to work in.<br /><br />It will be highly beneficial to spend the initial phase of your employment sitting side-by-side with our CTO Jorj, in order to get to grips with our existing systems, our roadmap, and our working expectations. This can either be done at one of our offices, or, potentially, at your work environment if it's more practical for Jorj to spend time there instead.<br /><br />As a growing business, our benefit structure is under review and will include a share options scheme and holiday entitlement boost.<br /><br />Holiday is pro rata at 28 days per year, inclusive of bank holidays. You get an additional day of leave for your birthday and may take 1 day per month for riding adventures / 12 days per year - in return for content for our magazine.<br /><br />Your application:<br /><br />Please include a bit about you/your CV of LinkedIn profile and answers to the following questions with your application;<br /><br />1. Talk about your preferred development environment: computer, software, and office.<br />2. What did you learn this week?<br />3. What is at the top of your riding (cycling, snowboarding, etc.) bucket-list?",

You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.</p><p>We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.</p><p>Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work. The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:</p><ul><li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li><li>Integration with various API’s and third-party systems.</li><li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li></ul><p>With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.</p><p>During your first week you will work closely with one or our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools. The system will be either Mac, Linux, or Windows to your preference, and we use Vagrant to manage virtual machines for a consistent development server stack. Other tools you will use include:</p><ul><li>Git for source control</li><li>Bitbucket for Git repositories</li><li>Jira for project management</li><li>Confluence for documentation</li><li>Slack for communication.</li></ul><p>As you get your feet under you we will introduce some project work, again in collaboration with a senior developer on a sprint they are currently working on. Ultimately our developers work independently on your own tickets and sprints. </p><p>In addition to competitive pay, a new computer, insurance, and 401k match, you’ll also receive:</p><ul><li>3 Weeks PTO plus approximately 10 vacation days annually</li><li>$1500 annual education stipend</li><li>Software stipend for the tools that you prefer to do the job</li></ul><p>To learn more about the company, visit <a href='http://www.beargroup.com' rel='nofollow'>www.beargroup.com</a>.

We do this by keeping the Wikimedia projects fast, secure, and available to all, protecting the values and policies that allow free knowledge projects like Wikipedia to thrive, building new features and tools to make it easy to read, edit, and share from the Wikimedia sites, and by supporting the communities of volunteers who make the projects possible.</p><p>At the Foundation, we build technology to help people everywhere access Wikipedia, across devices and in nearly 300 languages. We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia. Roughly a quarter of our budget goes to supporting the community that make the site possible, including through&nbsp;grantmaking programs&nbsp;that enable volunteers and enrich the information on the sites.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage people with a diverse range of backgrounds to apply.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully paid premiums for medical, dental &amp; vision insurance premiums                            </div>                            <div>                                 401(k) with 4% matching contribution                            </div>                            <div>                                 7-12 weeks parental leave with 100% pay + lactation room                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wellness Program ($1800 annual) to promote wellness &amp; personal growth                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pre-tax savings plans for Transportation &amp; Parking                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible work schedules and remote working options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pet Friendly office                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commitment to diversity &amp; inclusion throughout the employee lifecycle                            </div>                            <div>                                 12 days vacation, 19 days holiday, 2 days volunteer work and more!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Lean more at https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Work_with_us                            </div>                    ",

A health coach, a specially trained nurse, helps patients to increase their patients’ participation and understanding of their health conditions and to ensure a well-functioning health and social care pathway. The intervention begins at an early stage of the disease progression and is an individualised time-limited programme for each patient. PHC primarily works alongside primary care and pulls together resources, e.g. specialists, social care and voluntary sector, to cover all of the patient’s needs, whilst promoting self-care and patient education. Our model originates from scientific research of case and disease management and is supported by several randomised trials. <br />Health Navigator is an organisation founded by physicians and researchers from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. Health Navigator specialise in the provision of innovative health care services to achieve measurably improved outcomes for vulnerable patient groups, where one such service is Proactive Health Coaching (PHC).   <br />PHC has been provided to over 12,000 patients across a population of six million, 17 hospitals and 450 primary care centres in Scandinavia since 2010 and in York, UK since 2015. The intervention has delivered 20–40% reductions in unplanned hospital activity within the target patient groups. Over 90% of the patients say that their quality of life has increased, and 85% are either satisfied or very satisfied. The results have been published in two articles in the European Journal of Emergency Medicine. <br />",
