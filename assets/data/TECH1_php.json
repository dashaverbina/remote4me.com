After all, where else would you do it? You only have that one site, so when something needs changing, you do it there.</p><p>However, this practice has several drawbacks. Most of all that it’s very public. So, when something goes seriously wrong, it’s quite noticeable for people on your site.</p><div><h5>Preventing Common Mistakes</h5><p>When creating free or premium WordPress themes, you’re bound to make mistakes.

Most WordPress beginners have done this at one point or another. However, in this article, we want to show you a better way: <strong>local WordPress development</strong>.</p><p>What that means is setting up a copy of your website on your local hard drive. Doing so is incredibly useful. So, below we will talk about the benefits of building a local WordPress development environment, how to set one up and how to move your local site to the web when it’s ready.</p><p>This is important, so stay tuned!</p><h4>The Benefits Of Local WordPress Development</h4><p>Before diving into the <em>how</em>, let’s have a look at the <em>why</em>. Using a local development version of WordPress offers many benefits.</p>      <div>      <div>    <p>Getting the process <em>just</em> right ain't an easy task. That's why we've set up <strong>'this-is-how-I-work'-sessions</strong> — with smart cookies sharing what works really well for them. A part of the <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/' rel='nofollow'>Smashing Membership</a>, of course.</p>      <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/' rel='nofollow'>        Explore features&nbsp;→      </a>      </div>      <div>        <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/membership/' rel='nofollow'>        <div>                  </div>      </a>      </div>    </div>  <div><p>We already mentioned that you no longer have to make changes to your live site with all the risks involved with that. However, there is more:</p><ul><li><strong>Test themes and plugins</strong><br>With a local copy of your site, you can try out as many themes and plugin combinations as you want without risking taking your live site out due to incompatibilities.</li><li><strong>Update safely</strong><br>Another time when things are prone to go wrong are updates. With a local environment, you can update WordPress core and components to see if there are any problems before applying the updates to your live site.</li><li><strong>Independent of an online connection</strong> <br>With your WordPress site on your computer, you can work on it without being connected to the Internet. Thus, you can get work done even if there is no wifi.</li><li><strong>High performance/low cost</strong><br>Because site performance is not limited by an online connection, local sites usually run much faster. This makes for a better workflow. Also, as you will see, you can set it all up with free software, eliminating the need for a paid staging area.</li></ul><p>Sounds good? Then let’s see how to make it happen.</p><h4>How To Set Up A Local Development Environment For WordPress</h4><p>In this next part, we will show you how to set up your own local WordPress environment. First, we will go over what you need to do and then how to get it right.</p><h5>Tools You’ll Need</h5><p>In order to run, WordPress needs a server. That’s true for an online site as well as a local installation. So, we need to find a way to set one up on our computer.</p><p>That server also needs some software WordPress requires to work. Namely, that’s PHP (the platform’s main programming language) and MySQL for the database. Plus, it’s nice to have a MySQL user interface like <a href='https://www.phpmyadmin.net' rel='nofollow'>phpMyAdmin</a> to make handling the database more convenient.</p><p>In addition to that, need your favorite code editor or IDE (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment' rel='nofollow'>integrated development environment</a>) for the coding part. My choice is <a href='https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581629000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEN0VTbppcuZuo1LJsCm94h88UvGA' rel='nofollow'>Notepad++</a> but you might have your own preferences.</p><p>Finally, it’s useful to have some developer tools to analyze and debug your site, for example, to look at HTML and CSS. The easiest way is to use Chrome or Firefox (read <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/12/revisiting-firefox-devtools/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581629000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEBaIBIrWQbtsMeqGx7y_VVSGuwAg' rel='nofollow'>our article on Firefox's DevTools</a>), which have extensive functionality like that built in.</p><h5>Available Software</h5><p>We have several options at our disposal to set up local server environments. Some of the most well known are <a href='https://serverpress.com' rel='nofollow'>DesktopServer</a>, <a href='https://www.vagrantup.com' rel='nofollow'>Vagrant</a>, and <a href='https://local.getflywheel.com' rel='nofollow'>Local by Flywheel</a>. All of these contain the necessary components to set up a local server that WordPress can run on.</p><p>For this tutorial we will use <a href='https://www.apachefriends.org/' rel='nofollow'>XAMPP</a>. The name is an acronym and stands for “cross platform, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl”. If you have been paying attention, you will notice that we earlier noted MySQL and PHP as essential to running a WordPress website. In addition, Apache is an open source solution for creating servers. So, the software contains everything we need in one neat package. Plus, as “cross platform” suggests, XAMPP is available for both Windows, Mac and Linux computers.</p><p>To continue, if you haven’t done so already, head over to <a href='https://www.apachefriends.org/' rel='nofollow'>the official XAMPP website</a> and download a copy.</p><h5>How To Use XAMPP</h5><p>Installing XAMPP pretty much works like every other piece of software.</p><p>On Windows:</p><ol><li>Run the installer (note that you might get a warning about running unknown software, allow to continue).</li><li>When asked which components to install, make sure that Apache, MySQL, PHP, and phpMyAdmin are active.

The only difference: everything is done on your hard drive, not an FTP server or inside a hosting provider’s admin panel.</p><p>That means, to create a database for WordPress, you can simply go to <code>http://localhost/phpmyadmin</code>. Here, you find the same options as in the online version and can <a href='https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress%23Using_phpMyAdmin&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581640000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3rSK4UbV8xEIaM1dljQBLws-5cg' rel='nofollow'>create a database, user and password for WordPress</a>.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/71515eed-1c79-4679-973a-b982e763fbab/12-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Once that is done and you want to install WordPress, you can do so via the <code>htdocs</code> folder inside your installation of XAMPP. There, simply create a new directory, download <a href='https://wordpress.org/latest.zip' rel='nofollow'>the latest version of WordPress</a>, unpack the files and copy them into the new folder. After that, you can start the installation by going to <code>http://localhost/newdirectoryname</code>.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/c49d899e-13f3-4bb6-8f44-5c32084ee860/01-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>That’s basically it. Now that you have a running copy of WordPress on your website, you can install themes and plugins, <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/01/create-customize-wordpress-child-theme/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581642000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFL2cAnqRYIkUGPS-RHJnio9PBSzg' rel='nofollow'>set up a child theme</a>, change styles, <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/06/wordpress-custom-page-templates/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581643000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFXUp0Byb1NFqpe11VErK7KEEkR_A' rel='nofollow'>create custom page templates</a> and do whatever your heart desires.</p><p>When you are satisfied, you can then move the website from a local installation to live environment. That’s what we will talk about next.</p><h4>How To Deploy Your Site With A Plugin</h4><p>Alright, once your local site is up to your liking, it’s time to get it online. Just a quick note: if you want to get a copy of your existing live site to your hard drive, you can use the same process as described below only in reverse. The overall principles stay the same.</p>  <div></div><p>Either way, we can <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/04/moving-wordpress-website/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581644000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHffat6-FHejgiPDdPd570-xVpd7g' rel='nofollow'>do this manually</a> or via plugin and there are several solutions available. For this tutorial, we will use <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicator/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1515115581644000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDZDm0iLZ9c8rX5ArHpJJEKO9DmQ' rel='nofollow'>Duplicator</a>. I found it to be one of the most convenient free solutions and, as you will see, it makes things really easy.</p><h5>1. Install Duplicator</h5><p>Like every other WordPress plugin, you first need to install Duplicator in order to use it. For that, simply go to <code>Plugins</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;<code>Add New</code>. In the search box, input the plugin name and hit enter, it should be the first search result.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f17f7da8-b800-405a-8834-ef8b8c7b7c0a/05-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Click <code>Install Now</code> and activate once it’s done.</p><h5>2. Export Site</h5><p>When Duplicator is active on your site, it adds a new menu item in the WordPress dashboard. Clicking it gets you to this screen.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/26d61da4-d53a-4e96-a764-1f2378e0cabe/14-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Here, you can create a so-called package. In Duplicator that means a zipped up version of your site, database, and an installation file. To get started, simply click on <code>Create New</code>.</p><p>In the next step, you can enter a name for your package. However, it’s not really necessary unless you have a specific reason.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/648cc3d6-34ac-4e8c-a55d-c4d0b75c1fc6/10-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Under <code>Storage</code>, <code>Archive</code>, and <code>Installer</code> are options to determine where to save the archive (works for the Pro version only), exclude files or database tables from the migration and input the updated database credentials and new URL.</p><p>In most cases you can just leave everything as is, especially because Duplicator will attempt to fill in the new credentials automatically later. So, for now just hit <code>Next</code>.</p><p>After that, Duplicator will run a test to see if there are any problems.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8e347651-30dd-421a-add9-87e61a1079a5/07-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Unless something major pops up, just click on <code>Build</code> to begin building the package. This will start the backup process.</p><p>At the end of it, you get the option to download the zip file and installer with the click on the respective buttons or with the help of the <code>One-Click Download</code>.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/d5f2d0fc-2ef2-443b-aff5-063ccc4eb7f1/02-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners-800w.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Do so and you are done with this part of the process.</p><h5>3. Upload And Deploy Files On Your Server</h5><p>If all of this has gone down without a hitch, it’s now time to upload the generated files to their new home. For that, log into your FTP server and browse to your new site’s home directory. Then, start uploading the files we generated in the last step.</p><p>Once done, you can start the installation process by inputting <code>http://yoursite.com/installer.php</code> into the browser bar.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/3734fa20-6b01-441f-bf23-faa79b34cb6e/11-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>In the first step, the plugin checks the archive’s integrity and whether it can deploy the site in the current environment. You also get some advanced options that you are welcome to ignore at the moment. However, make sure to check the box where it says “I have read and accept all terms and notices,” before clicking <code>Next</code>.</p><p>Your site is now being unpacked. After that, you get to the screen where it’s time to input the database information.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/656b14d8-a681-417c-9bfe-1023c51ee813/03-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>The plugin can either create a new database (if your host allows it) or use an existing one. For the latter option, you need to set up the database manually beforehand. Either way, you need to input the database name, username, and password to continue. Duplicator will also use this information to update the <code>wp-config.php</code> file of your site so that it can talk to the new database. Click <code>Test Database</code> to see if the connection works. Hit <code>Next</code> to start the installation of the database.</p><p>Once Duplicator is done with that, the final step is to confirm the details of your old and new site.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/0778e278-426c-4d04-ab95-26036d53f55a/16-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>That way, Duplicator is able to replace all mentions of your old URL in the database with the new one. If you don’t, your site won’t work properly. If everything is fine, click the button that says <code>Next</code>.</p><h5>4. Finishing Up</h5><p>Now, there are just a few more things to do before you are finished. The first one is to check the last page of the setup for any problems encountered in the deployment.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ce355de3-ea88-484f-bb05-8c9be6012120/06-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>The second is to log into your new site (you can do so via the button). Doing so will land you in the Duplicator menu.</p>                                        <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fbdffc60-0943-4a6f-bfdf-8cb75b81d7b5/15-wordpress-local-development-for-beginners.jpg' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>            <p>Here, be sure to click on <code>Remove Installation Files Now!</code> at the top. This is important for security reasons.</p><p>And that’s it, your site should now be successfully migrated. Well done! You have just mastered the basics of local WordPress development.</p><h5>Quick Note: Updating Your Database Information Manually</h5><p>Should the Duplicator plugin for some reason be unable to update <code>wp-config.php</code> with the new database information, your site won’t work and you will see a warning that says “unable to establish database connection”.</p><p>In that case, you need to change the information manually. Do this by finding <code>wp-config.php</code> in your WordPress installation’s main folder. You can access it via FTP or a hosting backend like cPanel. Ask your provider for help if you find yourself unable to locate it on your own.</p><p>Edit the file (this might mean downloading, editing and re-uploading it) and find the following lines:</p><pre><code>/** The name of the database for WordPress */define('DB_NAME', 'database_name_here');/** MySQL database username */define('DB_USER', 'username_here');/** MySQL database password */define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here');/** MySQL hostname */define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');</code></pre><p>Update the information here with that of your new host (by replacing the info between the ' '), save the file and move it back to your site’s main directory. Now everything should be fine.</p><h4>WordPress Local Development In A Nutshell</h4><p>Learning how to install WordPress locally is super useful. It enables you to make site changes, run updates, test themes and plugins and more in a risk-free environment. In addition to that, it’s free thanks to open source software.</p><p>Above, you have learned how to build a local WordPress environment with XAMPP. We have led you through the installation process and explained how to use the local server with WordPress. We have also covered how to get your local site online once it’s ready to see the light of day.</p><p>Hopefully, your takeaway is that all of this is pretty easy. It might feel overwhelming as a beginner at first, however, using WordPress locally will become second nature quickly. Plus, the benefits clearly outweigh the learning process and will help you take your WordPress skills to the next level.</p><p>What are your thoughts on local WordPress development?

We are a real business with an already operational facility. (It’s not “This Little Piggy” – it’s another of our companies. We’re just being a little big hush-hush just now – for obvious reasons.)<br /><br />We have many, many opportunities to increase the scope of our business – but just not enough time to do it. So we need to be joined by a talented programmer with demonstrable skills in PHP, MySQL and associated technologies to help us push the project forward.<br /><br />This is not a paid position (in the conventional sense) but long-time rewards will be written into a contract and eventual participation (shareholder/cofounder) is possible.<br /><br />OK – so this is speculative. But so is life!<br /><br />And that will be part of the attraction for the right person who will recognise this for the opportunity that it is.<br /><br />Obviously this type of opportunity is not for everyone but if *YOU* have the skills, the initiative and the drive to make your contribution we would love to hear from you.<br /><br />Drop us an email now – and we’ll give you the full details.<br /><br />Thank you.",

Our team is remote with offices in Brooklyn, NY and Springfield, MO. </li><li>We are beginning a project with Airstream to expand their brand beyond trailers and into lifestyle and design goods that take advantage of their iconic aesthetic.

This will include creating/customizing useful APIs for the front end team to interact with WooCommerce data.</li><li>Customizing WooCommerce interfaces and functionality to make an admin interface that is enjoyable and approachable for non-technical users to manage their store function and inventory.</li><li>Develop integrations and API endpoints for 3rd party systems to share data about inventory levels, transactions, user profiles and more. Integrations will also include payment gateway(s) and marketing tools.</li><li>Exact requirements for the store and integrations have not been finalized. This makes exact scope difficult to determine now, but you will have an active role in defining the approach and solutions that are employed.</li><li>There will likely be other aspects of the back-end WordPress setup that you'll be asked to tackle or assist with, but the primary focus will be on WooCommerce and integrations.</li></ul><div><h3>The ideal person will:</h3></div><ul><li>Have extensive experience with WooCommerce and be comfortable developing customized workflows and offering qualified opinions about how best to use WooCommerce in various situations.</li><li>Have relevant WooCommerce examples in their portfolio along with references</li><li>Be well-versed in using WooCommerce and WordPress REST APIs to facilitate front end interfaces that are independent of WordPress. We anticipate the front end of the site will use some flavor of the React toolkit.</li><li>Be comfortable working independently with a remote team. You'll be expected to share rolling updates about your progress toward goals and attend periodic video chats about project status.</li><li>Be familiar with the usual remote team toolkit: Slack, GitHub, Google Docs/Sheets, etc</li><li>Have a flexible approach to most things - we aren't strictly agile or waterfall, we aren't zealots about LESS vs SCSS vs SASS and while OOP is a goal, it is not a hill worth dying on.</li></ul><div></div><ul><li>Actively document their work. The final product will be handed off to the client's existing teams for long-term support and they will require useful introduction to the technical choices and solutions.</li><li>Be an individual or a small team - we aren't opposed to teams applying, but we do want to have personal interaction with the person writing code, so small 1-3 person teams might be the best fit.</li><li>Have an adventurous spirit with an interest in travel, adventure, exploration or science. We look for partners that explore the real world with a keen interest for discovery and growth.</li><li>While you don't need a CS degree, you should have significant experience as a professional developer with a portfolio of eCommerce projects and available references.</li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Visit <a href='https://lat-long.breezy.hr/p/d4be1a08c737-woocommerce-developer' rel='nofollow'>https://lat-long.breezy.hr/p/d4be1a08c737-woocommerce-developer</a></p>  </div>",

We’re here to change that, and we need your help.</p><p>We started out in 2010 with an email subscription form, a YouTube account, and a lot of scrambling to figure things out. Even with over 40,000 clients in 80 countries, pretty much everything about how we’ve built our company and marketed our products has been bootstrapped by a small group of deeply invested people wearing a lot of hats and learning as we went along. Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</p><p>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and <strong>we are looking for a Front-End WP Developer to join GMB, part-time to start</strong>. You’ll be part of a team that is helping to imagine and build new products — as well as improve existing ones.</p><h2>What will be your responsibilities?</h2><ul><li>Working directly with our graphic designer to bring new design to code</li><li>Update and improve existing front-end code</li><li>Potential to work on the next version of our app and be involved in styleguide and UI library creation</li></ul><h3>To do this job, you will need:</h3><ul><li>Experience bringing WordPress themes to code (HTML/CSS/JS)</li><li>Some sense or experience in UX design</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end tools (Gulp, Sass, etc.)</li><li>Experience using git and GitHub workflows</li><li>Familiarity with CSS methodology (SMACSS, BEM, etc.)</li><li>Bonus points for some back-end and API familiarity especially with regard to WordPress</li></ul><h3>Other Requirements &amp; Competencies</h3><ul><li>You’ve been following GMB for a while and understand what sets us apart from other fitness companies.</li><li>You are clear on the value you’ll bring to the team.</li><li>You know how to follow instructions and how to be creative – and how to choose between them.</li><li>You speak and read/write perfect English.</li><li>You have a sense of humor.</li><li>You always work to develop a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>.</li><li>You are good at self-managing.</li><li>You have a strong DIY ethic – know what you don’t know and what you can do about it.</li><li>You can make things happen.

We’re working to make the world a better place by teaching people to take control of what their bodies can do so they can contribute to their families and communities. We create options for exploration and self-expression.</p><p>And we work the way we practice. Like our idea of fitness and the way we deliver our programs, very little about the way we work is like what you’d find in a traditional company. Here’s how we exemplify autonomy at work:</p><p>&nbsp;<span>Work and Live Anywhere</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Set Your Own Schedule.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Create Your Own Role.</span></p><p>We also take care of our people. Building a great team with full autonomy requires more than just freedom; we thrive in an environment that supports development and growth… and we bet you will too. Some of the things we value and encourage are:&nbsp;<span>continuous learning</span>,&nbsp;<span>travel &amp; facetime</span>, as well as&nbsp;<span>time off</span>. Learn more about all our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits here</a>.</p><p>If you like what you’ve read so far, familiarize yourself with who we are and what we’re&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>about</a>&nbsp;before going any further. You should also listen to this interview with Andy about&nbsp;<a href='https://mixergy.com/interviews/gmb-fitness-with-andy-fossett/' rel='nofollow'>how we grew GMB</a>&nbsp;and what’s important to us.</p><p>Want to learn more about the smart, fun people you’ll be working with?

Please read everything above&nbsp;<em>carefully</em>&nbsp;and make sure you understand that there are some fairly complex and technical requirements.</p><p>If that all sounds like stuff you can handle, we’d love to hear from you.

    "content": "Bikmo is an adventure sports technology company, with a simple mission to provide exceptional services that enable our customers to spend more time exploring the great outdoors.<br /><br />Focussing initially on insurance in the cycling sector, we're now live in the UK, Ireland, Germany and Austria and by utilising sector expertise, technology, a love for the sport and an open approach to data, we've won customers, partners, awards and 5-star reviews.<br /><br />We are searching for a technically excellent and self-starting full stack developer to join our CTO in developing the platform that will enable us to achieve this ambition. Rapid application development allows us to adapt to our customers' needs and stay one step ahead of the competition, so we're looking for an applicant with an agile and adaptive mind.<br /><br />Our ideal candidate would be one who has as much energy for adventure sports as they do coding - you can live and work in the heart of the Alps, the UK or where you choose.<br /><br />The role:<br /><br />You will be working on a number of existing applications, and aiding with the creation of new application as and when they are needed. Our applications use middleware stacks to allow efficient re-use of encapsulated code, and the rapid development and deployment of new systems and feature sets. As a startup, we are moving at a rapid pace and the successful candidate will need to be able to get up to speed quickly and work self-sufficiently.<br /><br />In our back-end work we follow PHP-fig standards where they apply. We check our code for 'mess' and standards before sharing with remote repos and other projects. We use the git-flow branching strategy, and code review via pull-request.<br /><br />In our front-end work we build templates in Twig which can be integrated into existing and new PHP server-side projects. Developers need to have a good understanding of how data can be provided from and delivered to the back-end application, through template rendering, form submission and API interaction. They need to be able to use composition and inheritance to implement an effective, efficient templating strategy.<br /><br />Valuable experience of using JS, and JQuery where appropriate, is essential to any of our front-end work. The developer should be able to manipulate the DOM to provide an exceptional user experience, and use application logic to interact with the back end application on-page.<br /><br />Benefits:<br /><br />This role is a full time role at 38 hours per week, Monday to Friday.<br /><br />The Bikmo HQ is based in Chester, but you do not need to be. Everyone in the Bikmo team works remotely to some degree. We also have offices in Innsbruck and Munich which you are welcome to work in.<br /><br />It will be highly beneficial to spend the initial phase of your employment sitting side-by-side with our CTO Jorj, in order to get to grips with our existing systems, our roadmap, and our working expectations. This can either be done at one of our offices, or, potentially, at your work environment if it's more practical for Jorj to spend time there instead.<br /><br />As a growing business, our benefit structure is under review and will include a share options scheme and holiday entitlement boost.<br /><br />Holiday is pro rata at 28 days per year, inclusive of bank holidays. You get an additional day of leave for your birthday and may take 1 day per month for riding adventures / 12 days per year - in return for content for our magazine.<br /><br />Your application:<br /><br />Please include a bit about you/your CV of LinkedIn profile and answers to the following questions with your application;<br /><br />1. Talk about your preferred development environment: computer, software, and office.<br />2. What did you learn this week?<br />3. What is at the top of your riding (cycling, snowboarding, etc.) bucket-list?",
