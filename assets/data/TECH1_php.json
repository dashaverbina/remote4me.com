We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia. Roughly a quarter of our budget goes to supporting the community that make the site possible, including through&nbsp;grantmaking programs&nbsp;that enable volunteers and enrich the information on the sites.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage people with a diverse range of backgrounds to apply.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully paid premiums for medical, dental &amp; vision insurance premiums                            </div>                            <div>                                 401(k) with 4% matching contribution                            </div>                            <div>                                 7-12 weeks parental leave with 100% pay + lactation room                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wellness Program ($1800 annual) to promote wellness &amp; personal growth                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pre-tax savings plans for Transportation &amp; Parking                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible work schedules and remote working options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pet Friendly office                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commitment to diversity &amp; inclusion throughout the employee lifecycle                            </div>                            <div>                                 12 days vacation, 19 days holiday, 2 days volunteer work and more!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Lean more at https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Work_with_us                            </div>                    ",

Your work will empower over 8,000 businesses around the world to provide great customer service, and will support other senior engineers on your team.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Tools we use</h4></div><ul><li>PHP 7.x</li><li>Lumen, Laravel, and Symfony</li><li>Backbone.js, Marionette.js, and React.js</li><li>Node.js</li><li>RabbitMQ</li><li>Redis</li><li>Pusher</li><li>Java(APIs)</li><li>MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB</li></ul><div><h4>About the role</h4></div><ul><li>The engineering team currently has thirty-four talented engineers. &nbsp;You will be working on one of the Help Scout web app teams, which currently has 6 engineers (PHP, JavaScript). On a typical day you may help a customer with an issue, work on a new feature, create a third party integration or enhance back-end tools to support our growth team. On any given project, you will be communicating with internal APIs, integrating with 3rd party services, optimizing processes using Redis, RabbitMQ, various AWS services, and wrapping it all up in support of a Backbone/Marionette or React front end.</li><li>Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/agile-remote-teams/' rel='nofollow'>remote, agile development</a>. When you are ready, youâll create and send a pull request with test cases and tag your team for review (often over a video and screen-sharing session).&nbsp;</li><li>We have invested heavily in local Docker development and cloud-based continuous integration and delivery so you can get setup fast and your development branch can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. Youâll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question canât be answered by our top-notch in-house support team and passes triage. Weâll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li></ul><div><h4>About you</h4></div><ul><li>You are very experienced with modern PHP development practices and open source frameworks. Youâve worked on these sorts of projects at scale and feel confident solving complex problems. You view âbest practicesâ as a starting point for critical thinking, rather than a dogma to follow.&nbsp;</li><li>You have created a single page application using Backbone (or a similar framework) and can write JavaScript from scratch to implement a feature. Marionette and/or React experience is a bonus, but not required. We can help you pick it up.</li><li>Your code is not only reliable and performant for customers, but can be read, maintained and understood easily by other engineers on your team. The&nbsp;<a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/' rel='nofollow'>Zen of Python</a>&nbsp;resonates with you for any language.</li><li>You believe in writing unit and integration tests and have at least tried TDD. You like owning the quality of the code you writeâ QA doesnât mean throwing it over the wall for someone else to test. You understand that some things are too costly to automate and must be manually tested to get it right.&nbsp;</li><li>You take pride in your work and ownership of the solutions you build. When a team member or customer is in need, you feel a sense of urgency to understand their pain and thoughtfully help.</li><li>You are curious and constantly learning. Believing that âa rising tide lifts all ships,â you make everyone around you better sharing what you have learned and looking for ways to improve both yourself and the team. &nbsp;</li><li>You are a humble professional who wants to be challenged by the work and not the workload. You are willing to ask for help when necessary and unafraid to say âI donât know.â At the same time, you have the confidence to take on complex and challenging problems.</li><li>You are proactive about solving problems and improving things. You take the initiative to build tools and processes that will help everyone. When working in the codebase, you leave things better than you found them.</li><li>You are an excellent communicator who can write and speak with empathy for our customers and team. You can easily communicate complex ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM- 6PM ET).</li></ul><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well. The formula we use to calculate all salaries is public to employees and is improved upon regularly.</li><li><span>Work anywhere</span>- Weâll fly you to Boston for a week of new employee on-boarding and buy your home office furniture or help you pay for a co-working space. You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM- 6PM ET).</li><li><span>Health and dental insurance</span>- We cover you and your family's health/dental insurance 100%. If you are based in the US, we'll cover you on our Aetna policy.</li><li><span>Long-term/Short-term Disability Insurance &amp; Life Insurance</span>- we cover 100% of the premiums for LT/ST Disability insurance and base Life Insurance. You also have the option to purchase supplementary life insurance through our provider.</li><li><span>International Benefit Stipend</span>- If youâre based outside the US, youâll receive a monthly stipend that goes towards covering medical insurance, long and short-term disability, and accountant costs.</li><li><span>Flexible vacation</span>- Take time off when you need it, we trust you.</li><li><span>Paid parental leave, including adoption</span>- 12 weeks if you have or adopt a baby, 4 weeks if your partner has a baby.</li><li><span>401k with 1% match</span>- 1% Retirement Plan matching for both US and International Employees</li><li><span>Personal development stipend</span>- Up to $1,800 per year to improve your craft</li><li><span>Great tools</span>- Each employee receives a Mac laptop and 27'' display (or equivalent).

Weâre always striving to do impactful work weâre proud of in lieu of chasing overnight success.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Weâre builders without borders</span></div><div><br></div><div>Our entire team is free to work remotely from wherever they choose. We overcome remote challenges through transparency, trust, and video conferencing. The reward is worth the effortâweâll take talent, skill, and diverse perspectives over local geography any day.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all, we want Help Scout to be a place where passionate people can do their very best work. You wonât find any ping-pong tables or kegerators here. Instead, youâll be surrounded by driven, supportive teammates who will push you to be better. We take work/life harmony seriously, too, as we want every career at Help Scout to be a long and satisfying one.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</span></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/diversity-inclusion/' rel='nofollow'>diversity and inclusion</a>.
