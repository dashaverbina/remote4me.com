    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Senior Full Stack Developer (Exciting Startup )</h2>      <h4>Posted Nov  1</h4>    <h3>      <span>Demio</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: We're Remote :D</span><br>        <a href='https://demio.com' rel='nofollow'>https://demio.com</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>Welcome! We’re excited to add a new Senior Full Stack Engineer to our team, but not just any engineer.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>We're looking for that someone special (yes, we're hoping that's you... keep reading to see </span><span></span><span>).</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Someone that shares our same vision. Someone that is willing to join us on our journey to change the way that businesses communicate, market, and sell online. Someone that is process-oriented and driven by seeing customers succeed.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>As a young start up (we're just coming up to our one year anniversary), we have tons of amazing users and are adding new great companies every single month.&nbsp; <b>A wonderful product experience is our primary focus here at Demio</b>... from the customer support, to the onboarding process, to the platform itself, we're working to hard to make it all a delightful experience. While the webinar, web-communication space has been around for a while and continues to grow, we believe that we’re creating an entirely new segment in the market and doing it in a simple way.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Demio is a simple but incredibly powerful webinar platform built for SaaS and Software companies</b>.&nbsp;With our platform, companies can generate leads, filter prospects, perform group demos, engaging sales presentations, integrate with their CRM, view advanced webinar reporting, track conversions, and more. It’s truly unlike any other product in the market.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Our team is small, but nimble. We love to employ great people, and we're hoping you might be the right addition to our amazing engineering team to join us on our big new initiatives and steps forward!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>However, we’re at the point now where we KNOW how pivotal it could be to find the right person to fill that role. We want someone to join our team who is hungry to make an impact, constantly striving to improve, highly responsible for their actions, focused on output and results, and understands that great companies are built one small step at a time.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>While we’re currently based in Tampa, FL, our entire team is remote, and we are happy to offer the ability to work remote with our team from&nbsp;ANYWHERE&nbsp;in the world through our systems in Slack (moving to Basecamp soon), Github, and Trello (yes, we use an Agile process). <b>We'll do everything we can to make a stress free, easy to navigate operation inside so your role is just as simple as our platform!</b></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Not only will you be remote, but we will offer a great starting salary while working with a small, agile team that is hungry and eager to make an impact. Your work will never go unnoticed. Your work will&nbsp;<b>ALWAYS</b>&nbsp;make large waves in the company.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>By joining now, you’ll be able to get in early on our company (But also the fun challenging product objectives) and help make some of the features/updates that will ultimately shape our product perfectly for our customers.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>We have a philosophy for our company that revolves around our team:&nbsp;<b>we ONLY work with A-Players</b>. A-Players, in our opinion, are people who cannot accept anything that is less than great.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>You’ll be able to work with a passionate, intelligent, and dedicated group of people that will allow you take your skills to the next level. You’ll always be challenged to be the best that you can be.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>But hey, we also like to have fun too </span><span></span><span>; we understand that building a company is quite the journey, and it can be incredibly hard, so we believe that it’s important to enjoy the moments along the way</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Skills and Requirements</b></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>What are we looking for from you? Well here’s a short list, but it will always be growing:<br></span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Developing scalable and reliable backend applications for our live webinar collaboration platform.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Excellent communication/english skills and ability to work well with remote teams (excellent verbal and written english skills)</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Follows coding best practices and develops appropriate testing and deployment scripts.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Monitors and develops standards for platform load/usage with recommendations for improving performance. (nothing is ever “perfect”)</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Takes ownership of problems and develops innovative solutions to solving them.</span></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>And the languages?&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>Well, you should have vast experience with a wide range of different programming languages, but at the same time, you should always be willing to learn &amp; grow more. Our ideal candidate has:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>At least 5 yrs of PHP experience (Phalcon PHP Framework would be plus, but not required)</span></li><li><span>At least 1 year of React.js experience</span></li><li><span>At least 5 years of JavaScript&nbsp;experience</span></li><li><span>At least 5 years of&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;experience</span></li><li><span>Experience with Amazon EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk usages is a plus</span></li><li>Have handled RESTful API connections and 3rd party API integrations via API</li><li>Working knowledge of MongoDB, and traditional SQL architectures.</li></ul><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Ok, now I know you're wondering... What's our stack built in? It’s pretty dang robust:&nbsp;</b></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><ul><li><span>Our Streaming platform is built in ReactJS, NodeJS, Socket.io, MongoDB, and WebRTC.<br></span></li><li><span>Our User platform is build in PhalconPHP, ReactJS, MySQL and a RESTful architecture.<br></span></li><li><span>Our iOS Mobile App is built in ReactNative and connects to WebRTC.&nbsp;<br></span></li></ul><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>What does the average day look like in Demio?&nbsp;Imagine this:&nbsp;</b></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Log in to our Slack (may be Basecamp soon) application when you login and high five the team already on </span><span></span><span>! Our team is all over the world, but we're always working together to innovate and move the company forward.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Review any development updates in Slack from your teammates on new code development, urgent tickets, new bug fixes, or what's new in the system for that day. Communication is always key here in a fast moving company!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Log into Trello and Github, review the sprint for that week and what the next tickets in that sprint on deck are. You can check in with our Director or Engineering to organize any priorities or make sure that your product story is being done right in regards to long-term scalability. You’ll want to commit those branches to Github and then launch them live on our Staging environment. <br></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Our QA lead can then head over and test the ticket in staging and make sure things are looking good. Move that ticket over, once approved, and we’re on to the next big win!</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>We're here to help our users as well, so that means sometimes taking a look at customer tickets coming in on priority and get those bug fixes moving quickly. Some days we’ll work on priority bugs and others on new tickets! (Most days a combination of both </span><span></span><span>.)</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>It'll be important that you keep communication with the team, QA, and support on what’s going on and where!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Then, you can high five your teammates again when you log off and update the team in Slack with your daily update!<span>&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Once a week, we'll review the sprint, goals, and any major issues plus we’ll meet month to look where to improve for better internal systems across the company. And if it’s a Friday, we might pop a few beers together (on Demio) and cheers to a great week!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>About Demio</b></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>At Demio, we are creating a culture of excitement and growth, driven by results.
