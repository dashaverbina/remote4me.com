We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</div><div><br></div><div>Our process reflects that. We’ve outlined our values and how we work above, and now we will ask you to complete a couple small tasks to show us you’re interested.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Create A Work Sample</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><em>The following is a typical task a product manager you’re working with will be doing on a daily basis.&nbsp; Since the position is for a player/coach, we’d like you to demonstrate basic competency as well.&nbsp; Please do not spend more than an hour on this task, as it is intended for you to be able to demonstrate basic competency in the core part of the job you will be doing.</em></div><div><br></div><div>We want to know how you think about designing elegant product solutions focused around increasing conversions.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div>Here is the website for a past client:&nbsp;<a href='http://www.hired.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hired.com</a>. Hired spends a lot of money (e.g. through paid ads) to drive applicants, primarily software engineers, to their site. Their goal is to increase the number of leads/applicants that complete the signup flow and are ready to be hired.</div><div><br></div><ol><li>Your first task is to come up with a hypothesis backlog of at least 6-8 ideas you have for improving conversions for&nbsp;<a href='http://hired.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hired.com</a>. An example of a hypothesis is:&nbsp;<em>“Adding a video to the Hired website will help job candidates understand how Hired works and therefore, increase conversions.”</em></li><li>Once you’ve developed your hypothesis backlog, choose one of the ideas that you believe is most likely to increase leads.</li><li>Write a spec for your chosen idea comprised of the user story, any supporting data, expected user or page interactions, engineering notes, etc. Optionally, you may also produce a wireframe and/or a visual to go along with your spec, using any number of UX tools such as Axure, Balsamiq, Invision or even simple pen/paper sketching. Just be sure to submit your spec as an image so anyone can view it without special software.<br><br></li></ol><div>In a real-life client situation, you will work with the client to create a testing roadmap supported by data that aligns with the client’s KPI’s. You’ll then write a spec for the experiments, and will work with engineering to implement and QA the experiment. Once the test is implemented, you’ll run an A/B test, share the results with the client, draw insights from the test, and develop new ideas for testing.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Paid Interview</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal. Thanks again for your interest in The Director of Growth Product Manager position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>When you’ve completed your hypothesis backlog and spec, please send an email to <a href='mailto:mike@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>mike@crometrics.com</a>, <a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a> and <a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>.

While this is not a sales role, it is a commercial role, so you will have some contact with customers and you need to be ready to explain our products and services to potential customers as part of your work.<br /><br />Main tasks:<br />Combining and analysing data from multiple sources to determine the effectiveness and impact of our sales and marketing efforts<br />Running social media accounts including LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook<br />Contributing to the Spend Network/Open Opps blog and publicising its contents<br />Identifying and following up on new business leads<br />Contacting business leads to introduce our products<br /><br />Requirements:<br />Keen interest in the analytical side of marketing<br />An understanding of how to establish a theory of what might be effective and to then test its effectiveness<br />Proven ability to analyse data using Excel<br />Excellent verbal communication with the ability to explain our products to potential customers<br />Strong written communication skills<br />Experience in using social media to promote activities, events, organisations or products<br />Enthusiasm to work in a startup company<br /><br />Applications:<br />Please send a CV of no more than two pages of A4 and a written statement of no more than one page of A4 to the email address in Spend Network's profile by the 16th of March.<br /><br />Benefits:<br />£80 per day<br />Opportunity for the right candidate to join the team full time.<br />Work with an ambitious and knowledgeable team, who are passionate about having an impact on the world.<br />A role with immediate responsibility, working directly with the founder to help grow the business.<br />Opportunity to grow your career in one of the leading CivTech businesses in London<br />Ability to work remotely, although it will be necessary to spend some time in London at the outset of the contract.<br /><br />It’s a great opportunity to shape the marketing strategy of a young and innovative business, providing valuable experience in business to business marketing. The internship will last around three months (might be longer, might be shorter), this will be long enough for the right candidate to prove their worth and to make the role a permanent one.<br />",

Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Director of Marketing</h4></div><div>Director of Marketing will develop and execute a cohesive marketing strategy, using data and insights, content and other business elements to increase new client acquisition for CROmetrics. This individual will assist in guiding the company’s brand identity and consistently communicating across all channels and touchpoints.</div><div><br></div><div>The ideal candidate is a self-starter, digitally savvy and thrives within a fast-paced environment. Combining strategic thinking, operational excellence and creativity, the candidate will develop, execute and scale processes and programs.

Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Our engineers value elegant code, but move fast.</span>&nbsp;We’re writing code that runs&nbsp;<em>on top of</em>&nbsp;existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). If “minimum viable product” isn’t in your lexicon, you aren’t a good fit.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The PM is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the PMs have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>A the core of experimentation is the lesson to be learned from the test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by setting the bar high for our team and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li><li>Read more about our culture and core values on our&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/culture/' rel='nofollow'>culture page</a>.</li></ul><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>A unique hiring process – we pay you to interview</h4></div><div>We’ve found that the best candidates shine most when they are able to participate directly with the team and show their skills in action. This does require some work from you, so we’ll pay you to join the team during a “paid interview”.</div><div><br></div><div>Assuming your application exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a paid interview where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal.<br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Apply now through this form: <a href='https://airtable.com/shrDsjeiQTHOMUSpo' rel='nofollow'>https://airtable.com/shrDsjeiQTHOMUSpo</a></p>  </div>",

We help students deeply learn concepts, build projects, and gain the confidence to start new careers (<a href='https://www.dataquest.io/stories' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dataquest.io/stories</a>).  We're all self-taught engineers, data scientists, and marketers, and we're eager to help others take the same journey that we did.  Read more about our philosophy at <a href='https://www.dataquest.io/blog/the-perfect-data-science-learning-tool/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dataquest.io/blog/the-perfect-data-science-learning-tool/</a>.</p><p>We're a bootstrapped team of 11 people, and we've been growing quickly since we launched 2.5 years ago.</p><p>We're looking for a director of marketing who can help increase awareness of Dataquest, our teaching method, and the successes of our students.</p><p>This includes:</p><p>* Owning and evolving our marketing strategy<br>* Managing and building our marketing team<br>* Optimizing key marketing metrics through experiments<br>* Developing a framework for creating, executing, and following up on marketing experiments<br>* Auditing and improving pages to rank better in search results<br>* Optimizing internal marketing and messaging, and driving students who sign up to subscribe<br>* Interfacing with our product and engineering teams to develop marketing-specific features and optimize existing features</p><p>Our content drives almost all of our signups in one way or another right now.  We write long, high-quality posts on data science topics on our blog, which result in referral and search traffic, shares, and signups.  Our blog gets around 200k unique visitors per month, and we like content marketing because it enables us to show students our teaching methods and add value before they start learning with us.</p><p>We're looking for someone who can cultivate new growth channels in addition to our content.  We're interested in the idea of marketing through tools, ads, features, and the courses themselves.  Examples would be retargeting ads, referral features, widgets that can be embedded in external websites, and encouraging students to create personal blogs and review Dataquest.  </p><p>It's important for you to be able to define the key metrics to optimize and develop a framework to figure out what channels have the highest ROI.  If you like having a daily dashboard and constantly optimizing your experiments to boost the dashboard metrics, this role may be a good fit for you.</p><p>There's substantial latitude and room to define the role and how it grows.  You'll be able to do everything from setting our marketing strategy to experimenting with ads to thinking of product features.  This role will be one of the most critical roles in our company, and will drive a significant amount of what we work on.  We think that we can grow revenue 4x+ in the next year, and we're looking for someone that's excited to tackle that challenge.</p><p>An ideal candidate will have:</p><p> * Deep experience with setting marketing metrics and running experiments<br> * Experience with developing marketing strategy<br> * Experience with ads and SEO<br> * Some management experience</p><p>In this role, you'll be able to see your impact on our students daily.  We hear from students who have been able to finish projects they never dreamed of (usually involving machine learning), who have been hired into exciting new jobs, or who just mastered a concept they never were able to &quot;get&quot; in school.</p><p>Although you don't need to be technical for this role, understanding some data science and SQL is a major plus.  Having analyzed data in the past is a must.</p></div>",

You’d work closely with a team of UX and UI designers, engineers, community managers, and sales staff to chart the direction of the product using data-driven hypothesis and testing.</div><div><br></div><div>We need someone who can work end-to-end through the entire product development process, from UX discovery, problem definition, information architecture, sprint and scrum planning, roadmap management, client management, and product marketing. We understand that your skillset will be stronger in some areas and weaker in others, but you need to contribute at every step of the product design and delivery process. This is a remote position.</div><div><br></div><div><em>We strongly encourage people from traditionally underrepresented populations in tech - such as women, People of Color, People with Disabilities, and LGBTQ+ people, etc - to apply!</em></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Responsibilities of this Role</h4></div><ul><li>Develop product strategy and direction to maintain relevance and value for users in a competitive marketplace.</li><li>Ultimately be responsible for the prioritization of features, bugs, backlog, and product direction.</li><li>Collaborate with product, engineering, and sales staff to scope, prototype, design, build, user test, and release software and communication material to users.</li><li>Manage the product roadmap for solving users’ problems from concept to implementation.</li><li>Contribute to and drive the product’s financial success.</li><li>Manage Ushahidi’s product and business metrics systems and tools to influence product roadmap and communicate them regularly to the team.</li><li>Manage engineering timelines and stakeholder expectations to ensure requirements are delivered on time.</li><li>Work with designers and community managers to do continuous UX testing and translate them into user stories and then into well scoped features.</li><li>Manage QA of product before product update releases.</li><li>Plan product releases, including QA, engineering support, and marketing content.</li><li>Contribute to the marketing and sales content of the product including campaign messaging, case studies, and website messaging.</li><li>Support account managers of enterprise clients to manage product customizations.</li><li>Ability to travel, with expectation of significant travel between key cities where our clients are based such as Washington DC, NYC, and a number of trips annually to Europe and Africa.</li></ul><div>We understand that your skillset will be stronger in some areas and weaker in others, but you will need to contribute at every step of the product design and delivery process</div><div><br></div><div><h4>What we are looking for in this role</h4></div><div>This is a hard job. We are a mission-driven social enterprise that makes open source software for the humanitarian, government, and international development industries to improve crisis response, election monitoring, citizen engagement, and human rights reporting. We have also had clients in the following markets: media, insurance, service delivery, municipalities, and private sector marketing. We sell software as a service and value added service to enterprise clients in the humanitarian and development sectors. We have a goal of increasing our earned revenue to make the product financially profitable in the next 18 months. In this role you need to grow our earned revenue while staying committed to our mission. This job is for someone who likes a challenge.</div><div><br></div><div>Your experience should include:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>At least 7+ years experience in software product management ideally for the international development, humanitarian, or public sector.</li><li>Proven experience building a software as a service product that serves a range of users, from free to enterprise level.</li><li>Proven experience managing mixed-discipline product teams to deliver software and being highly detail-oriented</li><li>Proven experience using and managing data and metrics systems to chart product development.</li><li>Proven experience doing user research and building products based on user needs.</li><li>Proven experience testing hypotheses to draw insights and make decisions.</li><li>Proven experience making technical recommendations throughout the web and mobile software stack</li><li>Preferred if you have a technical background with experience in HTML/CSS/Saas/Angular/React/PHP</li><li>Benefit if you have experience building open source software with a services business model.</li><li>Benefit if you have experience working with diverse, remote teams.</li><li>Benefit if you have experience building products that serve users who exist at the edge of the internet.</li></ul><div><h4>What we look for in all our employees</h4></div><ul><li>People who like working on hard problems.</li><li>Willingness to help out where you’re needed: responding to coworkers, helping community members in need, taking on a project that needs being done, researching best practices from other organizations and helping implement them here.</li><li>Drive for working with and supporting our clients and customers.</li><li>Drive for international development and social justice.</li><li>Eagerness to take feedback, grow and further your skills.</li><li>A passion for technology.</li><li>A desire to build things that aim to help those in need.</li><li>Ability to communicate effectively across cultures and time zones.</li></ul><div><h4>Why You Might Be A Good Fit</h4></div><ul><li>Independence. Ushahidi operates under a de facto system of commander’s intent in a largely remote working environment. That is, the team agrees upon goals and strategies, but the day to day of how it is accomplished is left largely up to each employee. Nobody will be leaning over your shoulder telling you what to do everyday and when to do it, we expect you to be able to do that yourself.</li><li>Intrinsically motivated. Ushahidi came from Nairobi, but team members work all around the world. If you need to come into an office and talk to your boss everyday to stay motivated, this job is not for you. If all you need is a crazy cool project, an awesome group of people online 24/7, wifi, and coffee (or tea), then you’ll fit right in.</li><li>Ability to get things done and hit metrics. Being remote and a group of self-driven people we don’t care how many hours you worked or how many meetings you went to, we all set tangible goals that move the needle each quarter and measure our success on those goals.</li></ul><div><h4>Why You Might Not Be A Good Fit</h4></div><ul><li>We pay competitively at Ushahidi using a pay calculator that is based on role, experience, location, and time at the company; however, keep in mind that we are still a mission driven non-profit and we recognize we do not pay what our for-profit software company friends pay. We believe that quality of life is as valuable as the dollar.</li><li>You are not able to get on phone calls at odd hours. The reality of being a remote organization is that we have lots of flexibility in our hours, but we have to also get on early morning or evening calls to accommodate time zones. Physics, sometimes it’s a pain.</li><li>You only want to wear one hat. Ushahidi is growing (30+ employees) but we take on the goals of much larger organizations. In practice this means that all Ushahidians end up wearing multiple hats and working on multiple projects. If that excites you, great. If you are set on never venturing out of your job title, you’re going to get frustrated fast.</li><li>You want to be in an office surrounded by colleagues. You will most likely be operating on your own most of the time, and in this role spending a lot of time on calls with the team, talking to users, or joining a client call, you will experience your colleagues through a video-chat the majority of the time.</li></ul><div><h3>BENEFITS</h3><h4>Why Working At Ushahidi Is Awesome</h4></div><ul><li>We don’t care when you work. There are no “business hours” at Ushahidi, we are milestone based, not a sit-in-your-chair from 9 to 5 company. Many staff have children and work around their schedules, all that matters is that you hit your milestones.</li><li>Ushahidi team members currently live all over the world: from Japan and New Zealand, to Nairobi and San Francisco, making this a global company while simultaneously small enough to know everyone.</li><li>Yearly company retreat in pretty incredible places such as the Kenyan Coast, a ranch in Austin, or the Italian Alps. We work remote, but once a year we get the whole company together in one physical location to plan for the year ahead, as well as hang out and enjoy each others company.</li><li>We aim to hire great people who support our open and diverse culture.</li><li>Quality of life. Ushahidi attracts workaholics, so we all work hard to make sure everyone has a work-life balance.</li><li>Other benefits: Take what you want vacation policy (<em>Minimum</em>&nbsp;25 days a year), parental leave</li><li>Healthcare insurance and other HR insurance package.</li><li>Co-working space stipend.</li><li>Interesting and engaging international travel.</li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p><a href='https://ushahidi.workable.com/j/83D0C50DD0' rel='nofollow'>https://ushahidi.workable.com/j/83D0C50DD0</a></p>  </div>",
