We are an online company.</span><br>        <a href='http://gmb.io/' rel='nofollow'>http://gmb.io/</a>      <br>      <a rel='nofollow'>View all GMB jobs →</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>Hi, we’re GMB, and we teach people how to use their bodies better.</div><div><br></div><div><blockquote></blockquote></div><div>The word “fitness” has been perverted to mean doing things you hate to impress people you don’t like with a body that’s too tired and sore to do anything fun. We’re here to change that, and we need your help.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We started out in 2010 with an email subscription form, a YouTube account, and a lot of scrambling to figure things out. Even with over 40,000 clients in 80 countries, pretty much everything about how we’ve built our company and marketed our products has been bootstrapped by a small group of deeply invested people wearing a lot of hats and learning as we went along. Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</div><div><br></div><div>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and continuing to push the limits of online marketing in a way that is fun, useful, and personal.</div><div><br></div><div>Do you get off on great email copywriting? Love parsing insights from survey responses? Fluent in Zapier integrations, custom fields, and nested email sequences? Most important: do you want to innovate and perfect the online marketing strategies everyone else will be using in the future?</div><div><br></div><div>If you can answer ‘yes’ to all of those, we want to hear from you.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Responsibilities for the Marketing Lead Role<br></b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>1. Overall Marketing Strategy</h4></div><div><br></div><div>You’ll work with our CEO to set the high-level, big-picture strategy for growing our brand and digital product sales. We market via content, social media, email, and advertising; you’ll need to understand the relative strengths, weaknesses, and priority of various strategies across these channels. You’ll be the glue that holds our creative and hard-working marketing team together, always coming up with ideas to explore. You’ll have all the data you can ask for to look for opportunities, test, and validate results. Your job will be to hold all this together in a unified marketing strategy and make it happen.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>2. Brand &amp; Messaging Alignment</h4></div><div><br></div><div>We’ve got eight years and over 40k clients worth of relationships, and we’ve learned a few things about the people we serve. Since we’ve developed a strong brand, you’ll need to learn and work with our voice. Work alongside company leaders, you’ll see that every team’s priorities and objectives build on each others’ successes and are in line with both our philosophy and company vision. You’ll need to be great at communicating to everyone you work with directly as well as with our other teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>3. Getting it Done</h4></div><div><br></div><div>This is not a hypothetical marketing role. At the end of the day, we still see ourselves as a fairly scrappy group. We like to get our hands dirty and make things happen. There’s always a balance to be struck between the researching, planning, and documenting side of things and the necessity to send emails, create upsells, and make forty subtly different versions of an ad to test. You’ll need to be comfortable switching between the two sides of the equation.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>In addition to that broad skillset, our ideal candidate has substantial experience in:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>ROI Thinking: comfortable crunching numbers and tracking/comparing analytics across platforms</li><li>Email Automation: complex workflows, personalization, custom/hidden fields, etc.</li><li>Basic SEO, working alongside our agency advisors</li><li>Identifying target audiences and devising digital campaigns that engage, inform and motivate</li><li>Planning, executing, and measuring experiments and conversion tests</li><li>Copywriting for sales pages, emails, ads, microcopy, and CTAs in a thousand different places</li><li>Coordinating between our copywriter, content authors, video editor, social media manager, designers, and developers to improve leading KPIs and bottom line revenue.</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div>We’re looking for an experienced marketer who can build systems, so be prepared to show us what you’ve done and the&nbsp;<span>results</span>&nbsp;you’ve produced.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Other Requirements &amp; Competencies</h4></div><div><br></div><ul><li>You’ve done some due diligence on GMB and understand what sets us apart from other fitness companies.</li><li>You’re clear on the value you’ll bring to the team.</li><li>You know how to follow instructions and how to be creative – and how to choose between them.</li><li>You speak and read/write perfect English.</li><li>You have a (somewhat twisted) sense of humor.</li><li>You work to develop a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>.</li><li>You’ve got a strong DIY ethic – know what you don’t know and what you can do about it.</li><li>You make things happen. You are a doer/maker as well as a planner.</li><li>You can manage written communication with a lot of different people.</li></ul><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><h4><br></h4></div><div><h4>Right now, our marketing team reports directly to our CEO and consists of:</h4></div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;a copywriter<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;a content manager<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;a graphic designer<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;a social media manager<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;a video editor<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;a partnerships wizard<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;a website page wrangler</div><div><br></div><div>We’re also currently working with agency assistance for SEO and Facebook advertising, and we’re looking to hire a dedicated front-end developer to help us make marketing-related changes to the website faster.</div><div><br></div><div>Some of the tools we use: WordPress, Drip, Optin Monster, LeadPages, LeadQuizzes, Zapier, Gravity Forms, and probably a couple dozen I’m forgetting… We’re always finding new things to tie into the mix, pushing the capabilities of various tools, and experimenting with different ways to learn about our leads and clients so we can engage with them more effectively (and teach them some useful shit in the process).</div><div><br></div><div>Compensation is competitive and commensurate with experience, but you can get a pretty good sense of our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits and such here</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>What’s it like working at GMB?</h3></div><div><br></div><div>GMB is a kick-ass company.</div><div><br></div><div>GMB is about creating autonomy. We’re working to make the world a better place by teaching people to take control of what their bodies can do so they can contribute to their families and communities. We create options for exploration and self-expression.</div><div><br></div><div>And we work the way we practice. Like our idea of fitness and the way we deliver our programs, very little about the way we work is like what you’d find in a traditional company.</div><div><br></div><div>Here’s how we exemplify autonomy at work:</div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;<span>Work and Live Anywhere</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>For this position, it’s best if you’re based somewhere in North America most of the time to make it easier to collaborate with the rest of the marketing team.</div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;<span>Set Your Own Schedule.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;<span>Create Your Own Role.</span></div><div><br></div><div>We also take care of our people. Building a great team with full autonomy requires more than just freedom; we thrive in an environment that supports development and growth… and we bet you will too. Some of the things we value and encourage are continuous learning, travel &amp; facetime, as well as time off.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If this sounds exciting, please make sure to</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>read this page as well</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to learn more about our company and how we handle hiring.</span></div><div><br></div><div>After that, familiarize yourself with who we are and what we’re&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>about</a>&nbsp;before going any further. You should also listen to this interview with Andy about&nbsp;<a href='https://mixergy.com/interviews/gmb-fitness-with-andy-fossett/' rel='nofollow'>how we grew GMB</a>&nbsp;and what’s important to us and how we keep integrity and relationships at the center of our marketing strategy.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to learn more about the smart, fun people you’ll be working with?

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere!)</strong> </p><p><span>Who are we?</span></p><p><span>BuySellAds operates the largest self-serve advertising marketplace on the web. We’re an adtech company empowering publishers and advertisers to connect more efficiently. We're growing fast, and we want you to be part of our team!</span><span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Don’t let the “adtech” part scare you away: our mission is to help publishers better monetize their sites so they can spend their time focusing on what they care about (their content!) rather than selling ads. We leverage tech to help broker these sales, and attempt to distance ourselves from the shady world of advertising that existed before.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 35+ people spread out across 30 cities in 6 countries. Our primary focus as a team is how our products can solve our user's needs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Who are you?</span></p><p><span>We are looking for a product manager, preferably with minor technical or design chops, to join our dev team. </span><span>Everyone on our dev team makes meaningful contributions that positively impact our team and our customers every day, and this role is particularly high-leverage if you're into that.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Our roles are intentionally open-ended. It's simple: tell us where you feel you provide most value. At a high level, you enjoy translating customer/stakeholder requirements to developer speak and back, and want to have an intimate attachment and contribution to our roadmap and product vision. You like ticketing, QA'ing, being involved in product design, and being responsible for deliverables/shipping.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Ideally you're comfortable working with git and making minor code changes (e.g. copy or design tweaks) locally at the very least. If you can design mockups in code, even better - we lean towards more technical product people because we believe this leads to tighter feedback loops, but this isn't a strict requirement so long as you're open to learning some stuff here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We are looking for someone who is:</span></p><ul><li><span>Able to help take requirements from users through to developers and back.</span></li><li><span>A self-starter: remote teams carry lots of autonomy. There’s no micromanaging here.</span></li><li><span>A great communicator: we’re big on teaching, learning, debating, and explaining, and these things require clear, deliberate communication.</span></li><li><span>Wary of bullet lists with more than 3 items in job postings: we aren’t heavily process-oriented or believe in tons of structure, and if your eyes have glazed over while reading this list, you might just fit right in.</span></li></ul><p><span>You’re likely more awesome than you think, so apply even if you only check a few of these boxes. Please note that r</span><span>ight now we're only hiring within 3 hours of Eastern Time.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Interested?</span></p><p><span>Woohoo! To apply, send us a blurb about who you are and what you’re into through Authentic Jobs. If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on products you've been involved with in the past and what you're looking to be doing now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straightforward: we'll do an initial phone screen, chat through some design decisions in a mock project via Slack (our primary mode of communication), and assign a take-home assignment paired with a programmer as well. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>And if we are the right fit? We’re stoked. Come build a platform to help fix advertising with us.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> Fully remote; small team/high impact; strong, motivated team. Big on mentorship and personal growth.</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, or New York.*</em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em><h4>What We Do</h4></em></div><div>Simply put, we make websites easier to use. Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Director of Growth Product Management</h4></div><div>As a Director of Growth Product Management at CROmetrics, you will be a player/coach overseeing a team of people who are hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to enable our product managers to be successful.&nbsp; Since you have done this yourself for a while, you’ll be able to quickly gain the respect of your team in showing them how it’s done while also helping them to develop the skills they’ll need to grow in their own careers.&nbsp; Product Managers spend much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, our Product Managers must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites while being rooted in better understanding what the customer wants.</div><div><br></div><div>Our PMs lead all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation</li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment</li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution</li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div>The director must be able to do all of these things on their own, and be focused on enabling their team to level up their skills.&nbsp; Expect about 10% travel as you visit key accounts regularly.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, as a CROmetrics team member, you will:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Support the professional growth of the team through leading and/or participating in ongoing training, e.g. book club</li><li>Engage in non-client related activities that help grow our business, e.g. writing the PM job description or delivering hypotheses and mock-ups for a sales deck</li><li>Actively participate in our remote culture</li></ul><div>If you don’t have previous management experience, an individual contributor role at CROmetrics might be a possibility. The type of individual contributor who will succeed in this role is strongly correlated with prior management experience since the type of client problems you encounter require solutions that leverage both the client and internal teams typical of strong internal product managers who need to influence teams that don’t report to them.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Who we’re looking for</h4></div><div>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>10+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on web products.&nbsp; You must have experience running successful, mature A/B testing or personalization programs.&nbsp; Familiarization with Optimizely is a bonus.</li><li>Experience managing other product managers or marketers running optimization programs.</li><li>5+ years experience managing others.</li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills</li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas</li><li>Passion for using data to&nbsp;improve user experiences</li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically</li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity</li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups</li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution</li><li>Lifelong learner</li></ul><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Our Culture</h4></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Our engineers value elegant code, but move fast.</span>&nbsp;We’re writing code that runs&nbsp;<em>on top of</em>&nbsp;existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). If “minimum viable product” isn’t in your lexicon, you aren’t a good fit.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The PM is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the PMs have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>A the core of experimentation is the lesson to be learned from the test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by setting the bar high for our team and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li><li>Read more about our culture and core values on our&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/culture/' rel='nofollow'>culture page</a>.</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><h4><b>A unique application and hiring process, just like us</b></h4></div><div>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</div><div><br></div><div>Our process reflects that. We’ve outlined our values and how we work above, and now we will ask you to complete a couple small tasks to show us you’re interested.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Create A Work Sample</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><em>The following is a typical task a product manager you’re working with will be doing on a daily basis.&nbsp; Since the position is for a player/coach, we’d like you to demonstrate basic competency as well.&nbsp; Please do not spend more than an hour on this task, as it is intended for you to be able to demonstrate basic competency in the core part of the job you will be doing.</em></div><div><br></div><div>We want to know how you think about designing elegant product solutions focused around increasing conversions.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div>Here is the website for a past client:&nbsp;<a href='http://www.hired.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hired.com</a>. Hired spends a lot of money (e.g. through paid ads) to drive applicants, primarily software engineers, to their site. Their goal is to increase the number of leads/applicants that complete the signup flow and are ready to be hired.</div><div><br></div><ol><li>Your first task is to come up with a hypothesis backlog of at least 6-8 ideas you have for improving conversions for&nbsp;<a href='http://hired.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hired.com</a>. An example of a hypothesis is:&nbsp;<em>“Adding a video to the Hired website will help job candidates understand how Hired works and therefore, increase conversions.”</em></li><li>Once you’ve developed your hypothesis backlog, choose one of the ideas that you believe is most likely to increase leads.</li><li>Write a spec for your chosen idea comprised of the user story, any supporting data, expected user or page interactions, engineering notes, etc. Optionally, you may also produce a wireframe and/or a visual to go along with your spec, using any number of UX tools such as Axure, Balsamiq, Invision or even simple pen/paper sketching. Just be sure to submit your spec as an image so anyone can view it without special software.<br><br></li></ol><div>In a real-life client situation, you will work with the client to create a testing roadmap supported by data that aligns with the client’s KPI’s. You’ll then write a spec for the experiments, and will work with engineering to implement and QA the experiment. Once the test is implemented, you’ll run an A/B test, share the results with the client, draw insights from the test, and develop new ideas for testing.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Paid Interview</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal. Thanks again for your interest in The Director of Growth Product Manager position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>When you’ve completed your hypothesis backlog and spec, please send an email to <a href='mailto:mike@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>mike@crometrics.com</a>, <a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a> and <a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>.

In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, or New York.*</em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em><h4>What We Do</h4></em></div><div>We make websites easier to use. Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>The Senior Growth Product Manager</h4></div><div>As a Senior Growth Product Manager at CROmetrics, you will be a hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to partner with our clients to improve their websites through data-driven experimentation and personalization. A Senior Growth Product Manager spends much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, the Senior Growth Product Manager must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites.</div><div><br></div><div>As a Senior Growth Product Manager, you will be leading all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation</li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment</li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution</li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics</li></ul><div><h4>Who we’re looking for</h4></div><div>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>5+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on consumer-facing web products</li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills</li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas</li><li>Passion for using data to improve user experiences</li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically</li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity</li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups</li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution</li><li>Lifelong learner</li></ul><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li>Matching 401k.</li><li>100% remote, preferably in U.S. time zones – work when and where you want (within reason).</li><li>Liberal vacation policy.</li><li>Performance-based bonuses.</li><li>All the professional gear you need to be successful (e.g. macbook, monitor, and noise-cancelling blackwire headset)</li><li>Workcations throughout the year in such exotic places as Cancun and Aspen.</li></ul><div><h4>Our Culture</h4></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<i>extremely</i>important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<i>improving</i>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and occasionally uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The Senior Growth Product Manager is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the Senior Growth Product Managers have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>At the core of experimentation is the insight to be learned from each test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by experimenting with our own processes and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li></ul><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.&nbsp;Sound like something you are interested in? Read on.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>A unique hiring process – we pay you to interview</h4></div><div>We’ve found that the best candidates shine most when they are able to participate directly with the team and show their skills in action. This does require some work from you, so we’ll pay you to join the team during a “paid interview”.</div><div><br></div><div>Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a paid interview where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal.</div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Apply now through this form: <a href='https://airtable.com/shrj97PLYSksnupsa' rel='nofollow'>https://airtable.com/shrj97PLYSksnupsa</a></p>  </div>",

People are evaluated, promoted and rewarded based on their results, not politics or hierarchy. </span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>We Are Grown-Ups</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We aren’t in the business of baby-sitting. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>No one watches your desk when you have a doctors’ appointment.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>No one tells you not to sleep 20 extra min if you had a bad night. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>No one minds if you pick your kids up from school.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>We can tell you are doing your job because you are driving results.

You freely take charge. You create opportunities, and you know how to get buy in to make them happen. You see money at the end of the road, and you know the path to get there.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You Have a Crush on Your Calculator</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our roots are direct marketing where we learned the hard way that personal opinions are secondary to measurable results. People who are comfortable with reading, interpreting and synthesizing data have a big advantage in our environment.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You Are “Home” Schooled</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You are a learner, constantly seeking out new skills and going and getting them. You want to learn to dance the Cha-cha? You’ll watch a YouTube video. Think you want to speak Spanish? You’ll get an audio-course. &nbsp;Whatever you want to learn, you go and learn it. You aren’t going to wait for someone to teach you. Your first instinct is to try to learn it on your own.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You Play Football, Not Tennis</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Team players only. You collaborate well with others. You are someone people want to work with and will work hard for.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You Are Dirty</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>There are no pristine hands here. Roll up your sleeves; prepare to own it. Some days, you’ll get so dirty you’ll need two showers. (p.s. But since we are 100% virtual, showers aren’t mandatory)</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You Make Banksy Jealous </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You create high impact experiences, and burst with creativity. But your artistic impulses are guided by data, trends and customer feedback, not by less tangible and unproven inputs. </span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You Are A Sure Bet</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You have measurable results to backup your marketing experience. Your references all want to rehire you. You are a proven money maker, and a high quality person.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><br></span></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>If this sounds like you, and you want to work in our creative, hard-working, collaborative environment, send your resume, cover letter and salary requirements to <a href='mailto:AmareHiring@AmareInc.com' rel='nofollow'>AmareHiring@AmareInc.com</a>.

Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Director of Marketing</h4></div><div>Director of Marketing will develop and execute a cohesive marketing strategy, using data and insights, content and other business elements to increase new client acquisition for CROmetrics.

Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Our engineers value elegant code, but move fast.</span>&nbsp;We’re writing code that runs&nbsp;<em>on top of</em>&nbsp;existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). If “minimum viable product” isn’t in your lexicon, you aren’t a good fit.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The PM is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the PMs have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>A the core of experimentation is the lesson to be learned from the test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by setting the bar high for our team and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li><li>Read more about our culture and core values on our&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/culture/' rel='nofollow'>culture page</a>.</li></ul><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>A unique hiring process – we pay you to interview</h4></div><div>We’ve found that the best candidates shine most when they are able to participate directly with the team and show their skills in action. This does require some work from you, so we’ll pay you to join the team during a “paid interview”.</div><div><br></div><div>Assuming your application exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a paid interview where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal.<br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Apply now through this form: <a href='https://airtable.com/shrDsjeiQTHOMUSpo' rel='nofollow'>https://airtable.com/shrDsjeiQTHOMUSpo</a></p>  </div>",
