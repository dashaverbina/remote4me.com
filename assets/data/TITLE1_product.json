Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>The Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant</h4></div><div>As a Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant at CROmetrics, you will be a hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to partner with our clients to improve their websites through data-driven experimentation and personalization. A Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant spends much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, the Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites.</div><div><br></div><div>As a Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant, you will be leading all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation</li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment</li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution</li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics</li></ul><div><h4>Who we’re looking for</h4></div><div>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>5+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on consumer-facing web products</li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills</li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas</li><li>Passion for using data to improve user experiences</li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically</li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity</li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups</li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution</li><li>Lifelong learner</li></ul><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li>Matching 401k.</li><li>100% remote, preferably in U.S. time zones – work when and where you want (within reason).</li><li>Liberal vacation policy.</li><li>Performance-based bonuses.</li><li>All the professional gear you need to be successful (e.g. macbook, monitor, and noise-cancelling blackwire headset)</li><li>Workcations throughout the year in such exotic places as Cancun and Aspen.</li></ul><div><h4>Our Culture</h4></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<i>extremely</i>important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<i>improving</i>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and occasionally uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>At the core of experimentation is the insight to be learned from each test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by experimenting with our own processes and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li></ul><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.&nbsp;Sound like something you are interested in? Read on.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>A unique hiring process – we pay you to interview</h4></div><div>We’ve found that the best candidates shine most when they are able to participate directly with the team and show their skills in action. This does require some work from you, so we’ll pay you to join the team during a “paid interview”.</div><div><br></div><div>Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a paid interview where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal.</div><div>Thanks again for your interest in the Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Interested?

    "content": "Master digital engagement, strengthen brand identity, and craft engaging campaigns.<br /><br />Are you a marketing addict? Do you love taking care of social media channels and exploring all the ways to make a brand explode online? Would it excite you to be part of a self-managing company with a creative culture?<br /><br />If so, read on...<br /><br />GrantTree’s Marketing team is at the dawn of an exciting new phase: we are launching a load of new marketing initiatives and we hope you'll join us for the journey.<br /><br />We are searching for the kind of marketeer who sees digital as the central core of a successful brand, as well as being adept at integrating social media with other traditional marketing activities, in particular events and gifting programmes. Customer engagement is your thing, you know when, where and how to add the ‘magic touches’ that improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br />Tasked with developing an exciting plan for our digital engagement strategies, you will create and manage the social media content calendar and coordinate with internal and external content producers to create a distinct, strong and personal flavour across our channels. It will be up to you to research and choose the right networks and channels to draw the most value from existing communities and influencers.<br /><br />We are looking for someone who can get stuck in quickly putting their focus on social media, video, real life events and a sprinkle of marketing support for all of GrantTree. Our environment offers the freedom to seriously grow, and we see the person in this role becoming a super strong marketeer over time - that kind of high-profile professional who is skilled at overseeing multiple channels and campaigns in order to satisfy multiple business needs.<br /><br />Today, you are comfortable with all of these tasks. Tomorrow, you will be someone able to own an entire brand strategy.<br /><br />Requirements<br /><br />- You have created social media strategies from scratch, implementing social video content and paid / ppc campaigns.<br /><br />- Engagement is key for you. You make use of your content production skills and exposure to email marketing to react quickly for maximum effect.<br /><br />- Social Media networks are your natural element and you master them expertly.<br /><br />- You have hands on experience on market research, audience research and targeting.<br /><br />- You are passionate about all things digital and the future of marketing excites you.<br /><br />- You can put together and manage small-scale events such as round tables, small panels, working breakfasts and you ideally have some experience with larger scale events.<br /><br />Benefits<br /><br />We believe that people should be rewarded fairly for the work they do. At GrantTree there is transparency over salaries and the way we work them out. For this role, this is likely to lie between £40k and £50k depending on experience. We also provide access to health insurance, cycle to work, and we have an annual profit sharing scheme for the whole team (which can be taken as shares or cash).<br /><br />Aside from money, we offer a place where you can be yourself. We want you to develop your skills and fulfil your potential. We have a flexible approach to working, and some of our staff work remotely most of the time. Our office near Old Street is bright and airy, with a well-stocked kitchen and a beautiful roof terrace. You can take up to 6 weeks as holiday each year.<br /><br />About Us<br /><br />GrantTree was founded 6 years ago and employs 34 people. In our culture everyone has the freedom, power and trust to do great work. We call this open culture. It’s been successful for us so far, although it's not for everyone (we suggest you check out our GlassDoor reviews). This is the ideal environment for creative, independent people.<br /><br />Equal Opportunities<br /><br />Teams are stronger when they have a diverse range of people. Applications are welcomed from everyone, regardless of the categories they put themselves in. We also encourage talented ‘square pegs’, who don’t neatly fit into the person specification, to apply.<br />Are you excited by GrantTree but not sure about this role? Join our recruitment mailing list to be the first to hear about future opportunities.",

It’s our goal for you to have work that you thoroughly enjoy (most of the time), that challenges you to grow (much of the time), and that ultimately makes you proud (all of the time). </p><p>This is a very specialized position. It’s not for most people. It requires a combination of experience, knowledge, and the ability to understand how our actions ultimately impact an organization. Ideally, you’ll also have the rare ability to see into the future. The combination of these traits are identified in less than 1.2% of the population. </p><p>If you think you've got what it takes, read on. </p><h4>As an&nbsp;ideal candidate, you should:</h4><ul><li>Be comfortable working directly with clients, managing expectations, and have the ability to break down complex issues for clients to their own technical level.</li><li>Be able to manage and maintain client relationships, coordinate with the team to ensure efforts are aligned with their objectives, and that calls and meetings are an upbeat and positive experience.</li><li>Understand the principles of search engine marketing and how to apply them in such a way that generates tangible results.</li><li>Have an understanding of content marketing, search engine optimization, conversion rate optimization, marketing automation, and the related elements that affect these practices.</li><li>Perform keyword/phrase research in coordination with client business objectives to optimize existing content and uncover new opportunities.</li><li>Create and execute/manage strategies for use across search engines, including content marketing, media buying, and more.</li><li>Understand the role these elements – and the website as a whole – relate to each client's organizational objectives and goals.</li><li>Be self-motivated and take initiative. If you're the kind of person who waits for someone to tell you what to do, this isn't your kind of place.</li><li>Be a problem solver, both collaboratively and on your own. Your Google-fu must be strong.</li><li>Be well-spoken and able to take command of a room, call, or conversation.</li><li>Be willing to give and receive feedback responsibly, have the perspective to evaluate it, and the flexibility to make adjustments.</li><li>Be an avid learner. Half the fun of this job is learning what goes on behind the scenes in new client industries and keeping up with a constantly shifting market and our own quick paced rapidly evolving industry. You should be excited to share knowledge by educating and receiving education from others both team members and clients.</li><li>Be passionate about your work. As an agency, we know the impact we have on the world is through the way we amplify our clients' impact. For that reason, we work only with people with whom we're well aligned.

Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>The Director of Growth Product Management</h3></div><div>As a Director of Growth Product Management at CROmetrics, you will be a player/coach overseeing a team of people who are hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to enable our product managers to be successful.&nbsp; Since you have done this yourself for a while, you’ll be able to quickly gain the respect of your team in showing them how it’s done while also helping them to develop the skills they’ll need to grow in their own careers.&nbsp; Product Managers spend much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, our Product Managers must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites while being rooted in better understanding what the customer wants.</div><div><br></div><div>Our PMs lead all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation</li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment</li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution</li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics</li></ul><div><br></div><div>The director must be able to do all of these things on their own, and be focused on enabling their team to level up their skills. Expect about 10% travel as you visit key accounts regularly.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, as a CROmetrics team member, you will:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Support the professional growth of the team through leading and/or participating in ongoing training, e.g. book club</li><li>Engage in non-client related activities that help grow our business, e.g. writing the PM job description or delivering hypotheses and mock-ups for a sales deck</li><li>Actively participate in our remote culture</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If you don’t have previous management experience, an individual contributor role at CROmetrics might be a possibility. The type of individual contributor who will succeed in this role is strongly correlated with prior management experience since the type of client problems you encounter require solutions that leverage both the client and internal teams typical of strong internal product managers who need to influence teams that don’t report to them.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Who we’re looking for</h3></div><div>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>10+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on web products.&nbsp; You must have experience running successful, mature A/B testing or personalization programs.&nbsp; Familiarization with Optimizely is a bonus.</li><li>Experience managing other product managers or marketers running optimization programs.</li><li>5+ years experience managing others.</li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills</li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas</li><li>Passion for using data to&nbsp;improve user experiences</li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically</li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity</li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups</li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution</li><li>Lifelong learner</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></div><div><br></div><div><h3>Our Culture</h3></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Our engineers value elegant code, but move fast.</span>&nbsp;We’re writing code that runs&nbsp;<em>on top of</em>&nbsp;existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). If “minimum viable product” isn’t in your lexicon, you aren’t a good fit.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The PM is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the PMs have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>A the core of experimentation is the lesson to be learned from the test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by setting the bar high for our team and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li><li>Read more about our culture and core values on our&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/culture/' rel='nofollow'>culture page</a>.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>A unique application and hiring process, just like us</h3></div><div>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us.

We’re searching for an <b>Advertising Manager</b> to help our our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can <b>set your own hours</b>, <b>take holidays as you see fit</b>, <b>work remotely</b> from home, and <b>help medical research succeed</b>, then please read on. </div><div><br></div><div><span>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research. </span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Our clients</b> – medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials. </div><div><br></div><div><b>Our company</b> – Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>We’re looking for someone who can:</span></h3><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Advertise</b></span><span>—You’ll need to create, manage and optimize our Facebook advertising campaigns and funnels. This includes strategy, persona creation, and complete ownership of the landing pages and multi-page forms we use to collect patient data.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Optimize</b></span><span>—You’ll be managing our campaigns from end to end, and expected to continuously run experiments and evaluate new strategies, processes and technologies to continuously improve performance and CPA. You’ll be expected to contribute to ongoing process and systems improvement, to support reliable campaign performance forecasting, efficient campaign setup, and CPA improvement.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Learn</b></span><span>—We’re looking for someone who’s driven to constantly update their advertising and marketing knowledge with the latest strategies and techniques. In addition to developing an in-depth understanding of clinical trials you’ll need to be able to rapidly develop a thorough understanding of each of our client’s clinical trials, their concerns, and then use that knowledge to create advertising collateral. If you’re intimidated by medical jargon then you need not apply.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Collaborate</b></span><span>—We’re looking for someone who will provide leadership in our advertising process, works well with the rest of our operations team, and is not afraid of picking up the phone, calling a client, brainstorming and working towards a solution. An important part of this role is to ensure that our successful advertising campaigns are resulting in our client’s success - our advertising funnel is just the first step, and it’s critical that our clients are able to convert the patients we’re providing.</span></div><div><h3><span>What’s in it for you:</span></h3></div><div><span><b>Autonomy</b></span><span>— We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a holiday policy (you can take your holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our team is remote (we communicate via Slack and Google Hangouts). We set our own hours based on what works for us and our clients. As long as you have a good internet connection and can overlap with our clients’ working hours, you can work from wherever you choose. You will need some flexibility to overlap some of your working hours with our team and clients. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Innovation</b></span><span>— We’re the first and only company in our industry to guarantee our results. We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g., our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews) that provide predictability and certainty in a volatile industry, and we’re constantly improving our service.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We apply the same innovative approach to our patient advertising and recruitment process. We’re focused on streamlining client onboarding, client education, and gathering feedback from our clients, and we're always interested in what improvements we can gain from the latest and greatest software tools and technology.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Impact</b></span><span>— Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clients—researchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practices—work hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are the only company that solves recruitment problems in a predictable and reliable way—our consistent, results-driven process makes us the only recruitment company that provides a money-back guarantee.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Growth</b></span><span>— As a member of a small, entrepreneurial team you'll be exposed to many areas of the business. You'll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You'll be continuously testing and implementing new advertising and marketing strategies. You'll have access to courses, books and training programs paid for by Trialfacts.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Opportunity</b></span><span>— We’re a rapidly growing company, 100% year-on-year via organic growth through repeat business, referrals and new clients. We're an innovative company in an industry ripe for disruption.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We offer a salary + results-based compensation package, and the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and/or leadership in the future. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>This position is for you if you:</span></h3><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Are great at synthesizing information</b></span><span> - whether it’s absorbing a client’s medical and research documents or analyzing vast amounts of data across multiple campaigns and funnel stages, you’ll need to be at home with receiving a high volume of input, honing in on what’s important, and efficiently moving forward. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are able to create compelling advertising and landing pages</b></span><span> - after synthesizing large amounts of information you need to be able to have a natural ability to be able to put yourself in the relevant person’s shoes to be able to create effective personas, advertising, landing pages and patient data collection forms.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Have a passion for testing and making data-driven decisions</b></span><span> - there’s no doubt advertising requires a love of both data and testing. If you’re not comfortable with gathering, manipulating and interpreting data, and constantly testing everything, then please don’t apply. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Love learning</b></span><span> - we're a team that's driven by learning and improving. &nbsp;We're looking for someone who wants to continuously learn and develop as an advertiser and marketer, grow as a person and constantly improve the service that we provide. If you’re not excited about learning and always taking that next course, then this position is not a good fit for you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are highly organized</b></span><span> - you'll be managing campaigns for many different clients, while also testing, creating and setting up new campaigns, and always learning more. If you're not highly organized and comfortable in a fast-paced environment then you're unlikely a good-fit for this role. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Look beyond the advertising campaigns</b></span><span> - when a patient converts for us, this is just the first step in our client’s larger funnel. We need to optimize and align what we’re doing, to ensure that we’re getting the right kind of conversions for our clients. If you just want to run ad campaigns and not think about what happens to someone after they sign up, this position is not for you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Have design skills (Canva, Photoshop or similar)</b></span><span> - Creating a great experience is essential in marketing. You don’t need formal design experience, but if you don’t know how to make something look good using appropriate color, font and spacing choices, or even worse - don’t think it’s important, then this position is not for you. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are proficient in HTML &amp; CSS (any other coding languages are an asset)</b></span><span> - Similar to the above, marketing today relies heavily on technology and automation. You don’t need any formal development experience but if you’re not comfortable with at least HTML &amp; CSS, please don’t apply. Similarly, if you’re not the kind of person that loves testing out new tools and technology, this position is not a good fit.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Excel at written communication and are not afraid to pick up the phone</b></span><span> - from landing page copy to communicating with clients via email, being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position. Being in a remote team, you must also be great at communicating, and if necessary be willing to pick up the phone and speak with our clients. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are flexible</b></span><span> - in an entrepreneurial business we sometimes have to wear different hats. We're looking for someone that takes ownership and wants to help grow our company. If you're the kind of person who would rather sit back and say &quot;that's not my responsibility&quot; then please don't apply.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are results-driven</b></span><span> - you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance which will directly impact your compensation.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are looking for a full-time position</b></span><span> - we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed fairly quickly. We’re not looking for someone who wants to run their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>Summary</span></h3></div><div><span>Yes, this position description is so long that it needs a summary! Here are the facts:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span><b>Set your own hours:</b></span><span> Choose when and how you work, so long as you are flexible to overlap with our team and clients when necessary. This is a full-time position.</span></li><li><span><b>Work remotely:</b></span><span> We’re a virtual team located around the globe. You can live nearly anywhere or travel with this position. You will need a reliable internet connection.</span></li><li><span><b>Results-based environment:</b></span><span> You’ll be evaluated based on your results. You will not be micro-managed, and you have the flexibility to set your own hours and work however you like, but you need to be meeting our advertisement targets for each client.</span></li><li><span><b>Commitment to learning:</b></span><span> We believe in continuous improvement and growth. You’ll be mentored, guided, and trained by our team and external resources, courses and training programs.</span></li><li><span><b>Contribute something meaningful to the world:</b></span><span> We make a lot of medical research possible that would otherwise fail, and remove the #1 headache faced by researchers in a predictable and reliable manner.</span></li><li><span><b>Trial period:</b></span><span> There will be an initial paid trial period probably lasting 2-3 weeks, but it’s possible it might be longer.</span></li><li><span><b>Compensation:</b></span><span> Compensation will be a monthly salary plus performance-based compensation package.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div><h3><span><span>Interested in making a difference with us?

If you just want to run ad campaigns and not think about what happens to someone after they sign up, this position is not for you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Have design skills (Canva, Photoshop or similar)</b></span><span> - Creating a great experience is essential in marketing. You don’t need formal design experience, but if you don’t know how to make something look good using appropriate color, font and spacing choices, or even worse - don’t think it’s important, then this position is not for you. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are proficient in HTML &amp; CSS (any other coding languages are an asset)</b></span><span> - Similar to the above, marketing today relies heavily on technology and automation. You don’t need any formal development experience but if you’re not comfortable with at least HTML &amp; CSS, please don’t apply. Similarly, if you’re not the kind of person that loves testing out new tools and technology, this position is not a good fit.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Excel at written communication and are not afraid to pick up the phone</b></span><span> - from landing page copy to communicating with clients via email, being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position. Being in a remote team, you must also be great at communicating, and if necessary be willing to pick up the phone and speak with our clients. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are flexible</b></span><span> - in an entrepreneurial business we sometimes have to wear different hats. We're looking for someone that takes ownership and wants to help grow our company. If you're the kind of person who would rather sit back and say 'that's not my responsibility' then please don't apply.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are results-driven</b></span><span> - you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance which will directly impact your compensation.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Are looking for a full-time position</b></span><span> - we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed fairly quickly. We’re not looking for someone who wants to run their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Yes, this position description is so long that it needs a summary! Here are the facts:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span><b>Set your own hours:</b></span><span> Choose when and how you work, so long as you are flexible to overlap with our team and clients when necessary. This is a full-time position.</span></li><li><span><b>Work remotely:</b></span><span> We’re a virtual team located around the globe. You can live nearly anywhere or travel with this position. You will need a reliable internet connection.</span></li><li><span><b>Results-based environment:</b></span><span> You’ll be evaluated based on your results. You will not be micro-managed, and you have the flexibility to set your own hours and work however you like, but you need to be meeting our advertisement targets for each client.</span></li><li><span><b>Commitment to learning:</b></span><span> We believe in continuous improvement and growth. You’ll be mentored, guided, and trained by our team and external resources, courses and training programs.</span></li><li><span><b>Contribute something meaningful to the world:</b></span><span> We make a lot of medical research possible that would otherwise fail, and remove the #1 headache faced by researchers in a predictable and reliable manner.</span></li><li><span><b>Trial period:</b></span><span> There will be an initial paid trial period probably lasting 2-3 weeks, but it’s possible it might be longer.</span></li><li><span><b>Compensation:</b></span><span> Compensation will be a monthly salary plus performance-based compensation package.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><p><strong>To apply:</strong> Please follow the application instructions at <a href='https://signup.trialfacts.com/advertising-manager' rel='nofollow'>https://signup.trialfacts.com/advertising-manager</a>.</p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

The position reports to npm’s Vice President of Marketing in Oakland, California.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>You’re a creative, organized, and versatile generalist who will help keep the marketing machine humming. You’ll create and iterate on our marketing efforts, particularly advertising, email marketing, and our website funnel. Other moving parts include marketing automation, site optimization and analytics, blog and web content, search engine marketing, and ad tools.</p><p>We’re looking for prior experience in digital marketing, marketing operations, or marketing communications, but that’s not rigid. If you are curious, adaptable, and kind, you can get the hang of this. Other members of our marketing team have been an unsuccessful screenwriter and a bartender at a Cajun restaurant, and our CEO started his career selling vacuum cleaners. It takes all kinds.</p><p><strong>About npm</strong></p><p>npm is kind of a big deal. Over 9 million software developers worldwide use npm, Inc.’s open source software and web registry to discover, share, and reuse packages of code. Our users download over 550,000 packages more than 3 billion times per week, and registry downloads have grown by more than 16x in the last two years.</p><p>Our paid products and services offer teams and companies additional ways to organize, share, and secure code, integrate npm with testing and deployment tools, and bring code reuse into the enterprise. More than 100,000 companies, including BBC, DocuSign, Electronic Arts, Hyperloop One, Juniper Networks, Nvidia, Slack, and Visa, rely on npm to reduce friction and build amazing things.</p><p><strong>About working at npm</strong></p><p>npm is not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests who take both our careers and our lives seriously. The best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We focus on tools and sustainable processes rather than on individual heroics, and we value flexibility, continual process improvements, and scrappy problem solving.</p><p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California, but if you have experience working remotely, we are open to this. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p><p><strong><em>Closing date for applications is Friday, November 3, 2017</em></strong></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",
