    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><h2><span>Job Description</span></h2><p><span>Analytics Fire builds custom software for the solar power industry. We’re looking for a collaborative but hands-on Solutions Architect to help us scale our execution to support additional new high-tech sectors.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Analytics Fire is a deeply technical engineering organization. Most of us are software engineers and spend the majority of our time on heads down engineering activities like coding. Our goal in creating this position is to expand our small client-facing team with a unique person that has both the personality and the technical skill set to collaborate directly with clients and senior members of the technical team in order to help steer technical decision making and requirements gathering, especially early in the project lifecycle.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This position is similar to that of a technical Program Manager, but you will be much more involved in the technical details and hurdles around software architecture than a traditional Project Manager would be. Our ideal candidate is a current or former full stack Software Engineer that is willing to be trained in formal Program Management processes (or has already been trained in formal Program Management processes).</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>As a small company, Analytics Fire is able to tailor roles around the strengths of our individual team members. We will tailor this role to your specific technical background. However, it is a hard requirement that you are able to support the following 3 types of responsibilities:</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><span>(a) Represent Analytics Fire software engineering teams in client-facing interactions (and sometimes interactions with potential clients)</span></p></li><li><p><span>(b) Technical writing responsibilities such as documenting requirements, project plans, system architecture, etc.</span></p></li><li><p><span>(c) Making meaningful contributions to the execution of complex software projects.</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><span>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</span></p></li><li><p><span>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</span></p></li><li><p><span>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</span></p></li><li><p><span>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</span></p></li><li><p><span>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</span></p></li><li><p><span>Agile collaboration and devops tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</span></p></li><li><p><span>Other technologies we are currently building with: AWS / Salesforce platform / iOS / ARKit</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your primary responsibility will be to assist in guiding new projects through sales, planning, development, and deployment. This will be accomplished through a combination of client interactions, technical writing, and participation in formal sales, program management, and engineering related processes. Your contributions will naturally be slightly front-loaded towards the sales and planning phases, however you will remain deeply connected to each project through the entire lifecycle in order to ensure conceptual integrity is maintained from design to final implementation.</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is a remote position but is only open to candidates living in the US or Canada. We’re flexible about location and hours. We’re a really great match for candidate who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</span><strong></strong></p><h2><span>Skills &amp; Requirements</span></h2><p><span>“Must have” requirements:</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><span>5+ years relevant hands-on experience as a full stack Software Engineer, DevOps engineer, or Site Reliability Engineer, ideally within a commercial startup environment.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Fluency around current modern best practices around software development and DevOps.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Soft skills necessary to navigate and negotiate with multiple teams, both internal and external to Analytics Fire.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Ability and willingness to familiarize yourself with our technical stack.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Superior organization and detail orientation.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Willingness to design, document, and evangelize new engineering processes to meet evolving organizational requirements.</span></p></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>“Nice to have” requirements:</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p><span>Former work experience or training as a technical Program Management.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Technical experience with Ruby, Python, or Node.js.</span></p></li></ul><h2><span>About Analytics Fire</span></h2><p><span>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>“We founded Analytics Fire to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. To us that means being able to spend our time working on interesting technical problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, or New York. Applications will be accepted through January 15, 2018.</em>*</h4></div><div><br></div><div><h4>What We Do</h4></div><div>We make websites easier to use. Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>The Senior Growth Product Manager</h4></div><div>As a Senior Growth Product Manager at CROmetrics, you will be a hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to partner with our clients to improve their websites through data-driven experimentation and personalization. A Senior Growth Product Manager spends much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, the Senior Growth Product Manager must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites.</div><div><br></div><div>As a Senior Growth Product Manager, you will be leading all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation</li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment</li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution</li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics</li></ul><div><h4>Who we’re looking for</h4></div><div>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>5+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on consumer-facing web products</li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills</li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas</li><li>Passion for using data to improve user experiences</li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically</li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity</li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups</li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution</li><li>Lifelong learner</li></ul><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li>Matching 401k.</li><li>100% remote, preferably in U.S. time zones – work when and where you want (within reason).</li><li>Liberal vacation policy.</li><li>Performance-based bonuses.</li><li>All the professional gear you need to be successful (e.g. macbook, monitor, and noise-cancelling blackwire headset)</li><li>Workcations throughout the year in such exotic places as Cancun and Aspen.</li></ul><div><h4>Our Culture</h4></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<i>extremely</i>important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<i>improving</i>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and occasionally uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The Senior Growth Product Manager is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the Senior Growth Product Managers have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>At the core of experimentation is the insight to be learned from each test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by experimenting with our own processes and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li></ul><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.&nbsp;Sound like something you are interested in? Read on.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>A unique hiring process – we pay you to interview</h4></div><div>We’ve found that the best candidates shine most when they are able to participate directly with the team and show their skills in action. This does require some work from you, so we’ll pay you to join the team during a “paid interview”.</div><div><br></div><div>Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a paid interview where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal.<br></div><div></div><div><span>Thanks again for your interest in the Senior Growth Product Manager position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</span></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Interested?

Do you love taking care of social media channels and exploring all the ways to make a brand explode online? Would it excite you to be part of a self-managing company with a creative culture?<br /><br />If so, read on...<br /><br />GrantTree’s Marketing team is at the dawn of an exciting new phase: we are launching a load of new marketing initiatives and we hope you'll join us for the journey.<br /><br />We are searching for the kind of marketeer who sees digital as the central core of a successful brand, as well as being adept at integrating social media with other traditional marketing activities, in particular events and gifting programmes. Customer engagement is your thing, you know when, where and how to add the ‘magic touches’ that improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br />Tasked with developing an exciting plan for our digital engagement strategies, you will create and manage the social media content calendar and coordinate with internal and external content producers to create a distinct, strong and personal flavour across our channels. It will be up to you to research and choose the right networks and channels to draw the most value from existing communities and influencers.<br /><br />We are looking for someone who can get stuck in quickly putting their focus on social media, video, real life events and a sprinkle of marketing support for all of GrantTree. Our environment offers the freedom to seriously grow, and we see the person in this role becoming a super strong marketeer over time - that kind of high-profile professional who is skilled at overseeing multiple channels and campaigns in order to satisfy multiple business needs.<br /><br />Today, you are comfortable with all of these tasks. Tomorrow, you will be someone able to own an entire brand strategy.<br /><br />Requirements<br /><br />- You have created social media strategies from scratch, implementing social video content and paid / ppc campaigns.<br /><br />- Engagement is key for you. You make use of your content production skills and exposure to email marketing to react quickly for maximum effect.<br /><br />- Social Media networks are your natural element and you master them expertly.<br /><br />- You have hands on experience on market research, audience research and targeting.<br /><br />- You are passionate about all things digital and the future of marketing excites you.<br /><br />- You can put together and manage small-scale events such as round tables, small panels, working breakfasts and you ideally have some experience with larger scale events.<br /><br />Benefits<br /><br />We believe that people should be rewarded fairly for the work they do. At GrantTree there is transparency over salaries and the way we work them out. For this role, this is likely to lie between £40k and £50k depending on experience. We also provide access to health insurance, cycle to work, and we have an annual profit sharing scheme for the whole team (which can be taken as shares or cash).<br /><br />Aside from money, we offer a place where you can be yourself. We want you to develop your skills and fulfil your potential. We have a flexible approach to working, and some of our staff work remotely most of the time. Our office near Old Street is bright and airy, with a well-stocked kitchen and a beautiful roof terrace. You can take up to 6 weeks as holiday each year.<br /><br />About Us<br /><br />GrantTree was founded 6 years ago and employs 34 people. In our culture everyone has the freedom, power and trust to do great work. We call this open culture. It’s been successful for us so far, although it's not for everyone (we suggest you check out our GlassDoor reviews). This is the ideal environment for creative, independent people.<br /><br />Equal Opportunities<br /><br />Teams are stronger when they have a diverse range of people. Applications are welcomed from everyone, regardless of the categories they put themselves in. We also encourage talented ‘square pegs’, who don’t neatly fit into the person specification, to apply.<br />Are you excited by GrantTree but not sure about this role?

For subscription companies, this is a HUGE problem. Left untreated, it can cause more than 50% of a company's churn. Left poorly-treated, customers face poor billing experiences, and companies lose good customers to bad process.</div><div><br></div><div>We're looking for our first full-time Growth Marketer to focus on educating our verticals about the problem of failed payments, how to increase retention with in-house systems, and why to ultimately outsource the job to Churn Buster.</div><div><br></div><div>You'll be working closely with Joelle (https://twitter.com/JoelleGoldman) to increase traffic, improve conversion, and expand brand recognition.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Here are some of the things you’ll be doing to accomplish those goals:&nbsp;</div><ul><li><b>Customer Research</b> (<i>interfacing with Ken and Carli in Sales</i>): ensuring our marketing site and blog get ahead of common objections, competitive comparisons, etc.</li><li><b>Product Marketing</b> (<i>interfacing with Matt and Scott in Product</i>): ensuring our marketing site and blog tell the story well of what can be done with Churn Buster</li><li><b>Integration Marketing</b>: ensuring our marketing site has public documentation for each of our payment processor integrations, and ensuring that we are included in each integration's directory on their site, and that we aren't missing out on co-marketing opportunities</li><li><b>Content Marketing</b> (<i>creation</i>): writing top-, middle-, and bottom-of-funnel content on our blog and marketing site</li><li><b>Content Marketing</b> (<i>distribution</i><span>): networking with others in the churn/retention space, positioning Churn Busters as experts, educating those in our verticals about the problem of failed payments, and how Churn Buster solves that problem better than any competitor or in-house system.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div>You may also help with marketing to current customers, past customers, and interested leads, but we're definitely cognizant of the distraction that can occur spinning too many plates at once.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Your core focus should be on content marketing (creation and distribution), driven by strategy, based on a deep understanding of what life is like for our leads and customers. You've learned the hard way that without understanding, you can't have strategy...and without strategy, you can't have an effective &amp; highly-focused content marketing program.</div><div><br></div><div>We're looking to you as the expert here and excited to give you plenty of autonomy to lead the charge in accomplishing the goals our leadership team (Ken, Joelle, and Matt) aligns around.</div><div><br></div><div>---</div><div><b>About You:</b></div><div>You've worked several years in online marketing, specifically writing content, and more importantly, distributing content.</div><div><br></div><div>You know how to research topics and people online. You don't hesitate to do cold outreach when you identify a potential partnership. And you put more effort into ensuring content spreads than in writing the perfect piece. That's not to say writing quality doesn't matter to us, we just all have a little perfectionist in us and have seen the lack of results that can lead to.</div><div><br></div><div>You have a deep understanding of the SaaS space. You know the impact churn can have on a business, and you're familiar with how better retention can be achieved. You're connected with marketers in the space, and you're able to leverage your network to amplify content.</div><div><br></div><div>You've also had experience marketing into verticals. While SaaS is a core-vertical for us, you'll also learn about other verticals we sell into, and you'll be responsible for researching them, and finding ways to gain visibility for Churn Buster amongst new audiences.</div><div>you lead with strategy, work with product/sales teams to understand customers, objections, etc</div><div><br></div><div>You understand that talking to existing customers is a great way to understand what they love about our service - or what they wish would change.</div><div><br></div><div>You see the value in talking to our sales team regularly to understand customer objections, the competitive landscape, and how to tell the right story on our marketing site pre-demo.</div><div><br></div><div>And you see the value in talking to our product team regularly to understand what's coming in the roadmap, and how best to leverage that to spread our story online.</div><div><br></div><div>You're comfortable putting yourself out there (like Gregory Ciotti, Dave Gerhardt, and Len Markidan have done for Help Scout, Drift, and GrooveHQ) and you're also eager to amplify the voices/learnings inside of Churn Buster.</div><div><br></div><div>You focus your efforts on high-value opportunities, backed by data/an understanding of where the value lies. You don't burden yourself with 50 recurring, low-value, never-closed loops which drain your creative energy and prevent high-value work.</div><div><br></div><div>Most importantly, you don't wait for permission. This isn't your first rodeo, and you won't let us slow you down.

You don't hesitate to do cold outreach when you identify a potential partnership. And you put more effort into ensuring content spreads than in writing the perfect piece. That's not to say writing quality doesn't matter to us, we just all have a little perfectionist in us and have seen the lack of results that can lead to.</div><div><br></div><div>You have a deep understanding of the SaaS space.

    "content": "<p>Part-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><p>Kin is seeking a UI engineer to join our small, distributed team for on a contract basis for 25-30 hours per week. The position begins immediately and you’re welcome to work remotely so long as you’re in the US and eligible to work here.</p><p>As a UI Engineer, you’re responsible for the entire technical lifecycle of Kin’s UI. That means working with our designer up front on interactions and best practices, then working closely with our back-end engineers to get your work wired into the application.</p><p><strong>About Kin</strong></p><p>Kin is focused on increasing mental health, well-being, engagement and retention within the workplace. We do this by using traditional HRIS features such as paid time-off management and new hire onboarding in reimagined ways that benefit both the employee and the bottom line. We launched in July of 2013, are completely bootstrapped, and we’re passionate about helping innovative companies grow, learn, and thrive.</p><p><strong>Why work at Kin?</strong></p><p>We’re a small, scrappy team. We’re constantly building, releasing, and improving the app, so you’ll see your work ship regularly. Though your primary role will be development, you will have influence on the direction of the product and plenty of transparency into how we run our business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who we’re looking for</strong></p><p>You are a front-end native. You speak clean, semantic, standards-compliant front-end code fluently. You have experience with dynamic CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS, and responsive UI isn’t a mountain you walk around.</p><p>You are absolutely solid with our technology set. Kin is built on Backbone,js, and you’ll be spending at least 50% of your time working directly in it. We use Handlebars for templating and Rivets for data binding. Our backend is built on C#/.NET. Though you don’t need to be fluent in C#, some experience with it is certainly a plus, as is experience with Wordpress. You will also need working knowledge and experience with consuming RESTful APIs.</p><p>You don’t want that job where you're told exactly what to do at every step. To succeed at Kin, you have to be interested in the product, interaction design, sales, and every other facet of the company. This isn't a job for someone who only wants to focus on what falls under a job title. If you’re looking for detailed specs and crisp corners, or are looking to be a cog in a big engine, this isn’t the gig for you.</p><p>You can succeed with a remote team. Our team isn’t huddled in a single location, so you need to be present, aware, and responsive with our distributed team. We use tools like Github, Basecamp, Slack, Google Hangouts, and DoneDone to keep both code and team synced. Constant communication and teamwork make the company tick.</p><p><strong>Additional Expectations</strong></p><ul><li>HTML, CSS, Backbone, Rivets, Handlebars, Javascript, JQuery and more is a plus</li><li>Experience with dynamic CSS preprocessors such as SASS and LESS</li><li>Experience working with Gulp and Webpack</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</li><li>Strong problem-solving skills and the ability to think for yourself.</li><li>Dedication to testing your work</li><li>You are comfortable building templates that will be integrated with server-side code</li><li>You like to document your code as well as keep organized</li><li>Experience working with the Bootstrap framework</li><li>Familiarity working in an integrated development environment (IDE) like Visual Studio</li><li>Experience using Litmus to verify that your email templates look as good as possible in different email clients</li><li>Experience using Browserstack or another multi browser testing platform</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, or New York</em></strong><br></p><p>Simply put, we make websites easier to use. Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.<br></p><p>As a Director of Growth Product Management at CROmetrics, you will be a player/coach overseeing a team of people who are hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to enable our product managers to be successful. Since you have done this yourself for a while, you’ll be able to quickly gain the respect of your team in showing them how it’s done while also helping them to develop the skills they’ll need to grow in their own careers. Product Managers spend much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, our Product Managers must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites while being rooted in better understanding what the customer wants.<br>Our PMs lead all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:<br></p><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation<br></li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment<br></li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution<br></li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics<br>The director must be able to do all of these things on their own, and be focused on enabling their team to level up their skills. Expect about 10% travel as you visit key accounts regularly.<br>In addition, as a CROmetrics team member, you will:<br></li><li>Support the professional growth of the team through leading and/or participating in ongoing training, e.g. book club<br></li><li>Engage in non-client related activities that help grow our business, e.g. writing the PM job description or delivering hypotheses and mock-ups for a sales deck<br></li><li>Actively participate in our remote culture<br>If you don’t have previous management experience, an individual contributor role at CROmetrics might be a possibility. The type of individual contributor who will succeed in this role is strongly correlated with prior management experience since the type of client problems you encounter require solutions that leverage both the client and internal teams typical of strong internal product managers who need to influence teams that don’t report to them.<br><p>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:<br></p></li><li>10+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on web products. You must have experience running successful, mature A/B testing or personalization programs. Familiarization with Optimizely is a bonus.<br></li><li>Experience managing other product managers or marketers running optimization programs.<br></li><li>5+ years experience managing others.<br></li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills<br></li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas<br></li><li>Passion for using data to improve user experiences<br></li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically<br></li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity<br></li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups<br></li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution<br></li><li>Lifelong learner<br>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here <a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>to learn more about the team.</a><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email chris@crometrics.com or tom@crometrics.com.</em><br></li><li><strong>We’re a remote company.</strong> We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.<br></li><li><strong>Our engineers value elegant code, but move fast.</strong> We’re writing code that runs on top of existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). If “minimum viable product” isn’t in your lexicon, you aren’t a good fit.<br></li><li><strong>Communication is critical.</strong> We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension — extremely important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes, improving processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.<br></li><li><strong>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.</strong> The PM is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the PMs have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!<br></li><li><strong>We are not perfect.</strong> A the core of experimentation is the lesson to be learned from the test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by setting the bar high for our team and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.<br></li><li>Read more about our culture and core values on our <a href='https://crometrics.com/culture/' rel='nofollow'>culture page</a>.This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by: This is Professionalism: <a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/</a><em>Sound like something you are interested in?

Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>The Director of Growth Product Management</h4></div><div>As a Director of Growth Product Management at CROmetrics, you will be a player/coach overseeing a team of people who are hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to enable our product managers to be successful.&nbsp; Since you have done this yourself for a while, you’ll be able to quickly gain the respect of your team in showing them how it’s done while also helping them to develop the skills they’ll need to grow in their own careers.&nbsp; Product Managers spend much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, our Product Managers must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites while being rooted in better understanding what the customer wants.</div><div><br></div><div>Our PMs lead all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation</li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment</li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution</li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics</li></ul><div><br></div><div>The director must be able to do all of these things on their own, and be focused on enabling their team to level up their skills. Expect about 10% travel as you visit key accounts regularly.</div><div><br></div><div>In addition, as a CROmetrics team member, you will:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Support the professional growth of the team through leading and/or participating in ongoing training, e.g. book club</li><li>Engage in non-client related activities that help grow our business, e.g. writing the PM job description or delivering hypotheses and mock-ups for a sales deck</li><li>Actively participate in our remote culture</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If you don’t have previous management experience, an individual contributor role at CROmetrics might be a possibility. The type of individual contributor who will succeed in this role is strongly correlated with prior management experience since the type of client problems you encounter require solutions that leverage both the client and internal teams typical of strong internal product managers who need to influence teams that don’t report to them.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Who we’re looking for</h4></div><div>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>10+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on web products.&nbsp; You must have experience running successful, mature A/B testing or personalization programs.&nbsp; Familiarization with Optimizely is a bonus.</li><li>Experience managing other product managers or marketers running optimization programs.</li><li>5+ years experience managing others.</li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills</li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas</li><li>Passion for using data to&nbsp;improve user experiences</li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically</li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity</li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups</li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution</li><li>Lifelong learner</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Our Culture</h4></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Our engineers value elegant code, but move fast.</span>&nbsp;We’re writing code that runs&nbsp;<em>on top of</em>&nbsp;existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). If “minimum viable product” isn’t in your lexicon, you aren’t a good fit.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The PM is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the PMs have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>A the core of experimentation is the lesson to be learned from the test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by setting the bar high for our team and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li><li>Read more about our culture and core values on our&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/culture/' rel='nofollow'>culture page</a>.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>A unique application and hiring process, just like us</h4></div><div>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</div><div><br></div><div>Our process reflects that. We’ve outlined our values and how we work above, and now we will ask you to complete a couple small tasks to show us you’re interested.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Create A Work Sample</span><br></div><div></div><div><em>The following is a typical task a product manager you’re working with will be doing on a daily basis.&nbsp; Since the position is for a player/coach, we’d like you to demonstrate basic competency as well.&nbsp; Please do not spend more than an hour on this task, as it is intended for you to be able to demonstrate basic competency in the core part of the job you will be doing.</em></div><div><br></div><div>We want to know how you think about designing elegant product solutions focused around increasing conversions.<br></div><div></div><div>Here is the website for a past client:&nbsp;<a href='http://www.hired.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hired.com</a>. Hired spends a lot of money (e.g. through paid ads) to drive applicants, primarily software engineers, to their site. Their goal is to increase the number of leads/applicants that complete the signup flow and are ready to be hired.</div><div><br></div><ol><li>Your first task is to come up with a hypothesis backlog of at least 6-8 ideas you have for improving conversions for&nbsp;<a href='http://hired.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hired.com</a>. An example of a hypothesis is:&nbsp;<em>“Adding a video to the Hired website will help job candidates understand how Hired works and therefore, increase conversions.”</em></li><li>Once you’ve developed your hypothesis backlog, choose one of the ideas that you believe is most likely to increase leads.</li><li>Write a spec for your chosen idea comprised of the user story, any supporting data, expected user or page interactions, engineering notes, etc. Optionally, you may also produce a wireframe and/or a visual to go along with your spec, using any number of UX tools such as Axure, Balsamiq, Invision or even simple pen/paper sketching. Just be sure to submit your spec as an image so anyone can view it without special software.</li></ol><div>In a real-life client situation, you will work with the client to create a testing roadmap supported by data that aligns with the client’s KPI’s. You’ll then write a spec for the experiments, and will work with engineering to implement and QA the experiment. Once the test is implemented, you’ll run an A/B test, share the results with the client, draw insights from the test, and develop new ideas for testing.</div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>When you’ve completed your hypothesis backlog and spec, please send an email to <a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a> and <a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>. In the email, include the following: +A cover letter that includes a description of prior AB Testing, agency, and/or management experience. +A link to your LinkedIn profile and the name of the town/city you live in. Note the job is open to US-based applicants only. +Desired annual compensation range (to ensure we’re not wasting one another’s time – we’re not going to hold you to this number) and general availability. +The hypothesis/ideas backlog you created for Hired.com +The spec/wireframe for one of your top hypotheses. Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal. Thanks again for your interest in the Director of Growth Product Manager position with CROmetrics. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>  </div>",

ByBox have done this using its world-beating electronic-box technology and in-house developed software platform to provide the most sophisticated field service solution in the UK. The ByBox solution disrupted the market by increasing service while reducing cost for customers, so that it now dominates the UK market.</p><p>ByBox is now taking its technology globally by building on its already impressive software development team to build a technology team capable of delivering electronic box-based solutions to a global market. The ByBox suite of mobile, web, and client-based applications cover:</p><ul><li>Bluetooth electronic lockers</li><li>Multi-tenanted customer web-applications</li><li>End-user mobile applications</li><li>Logistics support &amp; label/barcode generation</li><li>Warehouse management systems</li><li>Customer-facing order portals</li><li>Customer and 3<sup>rd</sup>-party EDI</li><li>In-field mobile device and scanner solutions</li><li>Automated testing facilities</li><li>And much, much more</li></ul><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>ByBox requires an experienced, enthusiastic, and highly motivated Software professional to take on the new role of Technical Content Author at ByBox, in the Software Development department. As the first person to fill this role you will be expected to bring your experience to the team and influence how technical documentation fits into the Software Development Lifecycle in ByBox.</p><p>Until now technical documentation at ByBox has largely been in the form of written documents, been completed by a range of people, and of a mixed quality, but as our team and Software Portfolio grows the need for high-quality technical content has also increased, and deserves dedicated attention from a professional Technical Content Author. This is especially important now, as much of the documentation will be customer-focused; therefore, content must be designed and delivered with an emphasis on presentation, accuracy, clarity, and usability.</p><p>With the support of the development team (in particular the business analysts and system specialists) you will be responsible for owning and maintaining the software team's product catalogue/portfolio and producing user guides (including technical installation instructions), and content for the ByBox marketing team. Working closely with Product Owners you will produce professional documentation for our key products. You will also drive the adoption of the latest mediums for knowledge transfer, such as through e-learning tools, online video, and other techniques. The Software Development team will look to you for guidance on documentation strategy, techniques, templates, and media content. You will also have overall responsibility for guiding the structure and standards in our internal Knowledge Base Wiki.</p><p>Your duties will include:</p><ul><li>Own, develop and maintain the content of ByBox Software Product Catalogue/Portfolio, producing content suitable for both internal and external audiences.</li><li>Be involved from the early stages of projects to understand the solution, and to understand the documentation/training requirements of the end-users.</li><li>Produce appropriate technical content for the end-users of our software, including Users&nbsp; Guides, technical installation instructions, and integration/API guides.</li><li>Understand the configuration and use-cases of the ByBox products to be self-reliant in producing appropriate content (e.g. screenshots, screencasts, videos etc.)</li><li>Drive the adoption of other techniques such as e-learning and online videos, or other media.</li><li>Guide the standardization of documentation and other content and help define our documentation strategy.</li><li>Gather feedback on the usability of content from internal and external customers, and regularly review content and processes to ensure best practices.</li><li>Work with technical team to make products easier to use and thus need fewer instructions.</li><li>Keep up to date with changing technologies, developments and trends in the industry, attending training courses as necessary.</li><li>Work closely with the ByBox Marketing team to produce suitable content for their Marketing material.</li></ul><p>You will receive full domain training where necessary; and experts in all areas of existing systems will be on hand throughout projects™ lifetimes and beyond.</p><p>ByBox is opening a new 'Tech Hub' office in Oxford (opening 2018), and this role will be based from this office, which will be a key place for knowledge transfer, testing our products and utilising demo systems. However, we have a flexible working culture, and with mutual agreement you can spend a proportion of your time working from home. There will also be some travel to other sites in the UK, namely our facilities in Coventry and Milton Keynes.

The position reports to npm’s Vice President of Marketing in Oakland, California.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>You’re a creative, organized, and versatile generalist who will help keep the marketing machine humming. You’ll create and iterate on our marketing efforts, particularly advertising, email marketing, and our website funnel. Other moving parts include marketing automation, site optimization and analytics, blog and web content, search engine marketing, and ad tools.</p><p>We’re looking for prior experience in digital marketing, marketing operations, or marketing communications, but that’s not rigid. If you are curious, adaptable, and kind, you can get the hang of this. Other members of our marketing team have been an unsuccessful screenwriter and a bartender at a Cajun restaurant, and our CEO started his career selling vacuum cleaners. It takes all kinds.</p><p><strong>About npm</strong></p><p>npm is kind of a big deal. Over 9 million software developers worldwide use npm, Inc.’s open source software and web registry to discover, share, and reuse packages of code. Our users download over 550,000 packages more than 3 billion times per week, and registry downloads have grown by more than 16x in the last two years.</p><p>Our paid products and services offer teams and companies additional ways to organize, share, and secure code, integrate npm with testing and deployment tools, and bring code reuse into the enterprise. More than 100,000 companies, including BBC, DocuSign, Electronic Arts, Hyperloop One, Juniper Networks, Nvidia, Slack, and Visa, rely on npm to reduce friction and build amazing things.</p><p><strong>About working at npm</strong></p><p>npm is not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests who take both our careers and our lives seriously. The best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We focus on tools and sustainable processes rather than on individual heroics, and we value flexibility, continual process improvements, and scrappy problem solving.</p><p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California, but if you have experience working remotely, we are open to this. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p><p><strong><em>Closing date for applications is Friday, November 3, 2017</em></strong></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",
