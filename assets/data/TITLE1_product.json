Read more about our philosophy at <a href='https://www.dataquest.io/blog/the-perfect-data-science-learning-tool/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dataquest.io/blog/the-perfect-data-science-learning-tool/</a>.</p><p>We're a bootstrapped team of 11 people, and we've been growing quickly since we launched 2.5 years ago.</p><p>We're looking for a director of marketing who can help increase awareness of Dataquest, our teaching method, and the successes of our students.</p><p>This includes:</p><p>* Owning and evolving our marketing strategy<br>* Managing and building our marketing team<br>* Optimizing key marketing metrics through experiments<br>* Developing a framework for creating, executing, and following up on marketing experiments<br>* Auditing and improving pages to rank better in search results<br>* Optimizing internal marketing and messaging, and driving students who sign up to subscribe<br>* Interfacing with our product and engineering teams to develop marketing-specific features and optimize existing features</p><p>Our content drives almost all of our signups in one way or another right now.  We write long, high-quality posts on data science topics on our blog, which result in referral and search traffic, shares, and signups.  Our blog gets around 200k unique visitors per month, and we like content marketing because it enables us to show students our teaching methods and add value before they start learning with us.</p><p>We're looking for someone who can cultivate new growth channels in addition to our content.  We're interested in the idea of marketing through tools, ads, features, and the courses themselves.  Examples would be retargeting ads, referral features, widgets that can be embedded in external websites, and encouraging students to create personal blogs and review Dataquest.  </p><p>It's important for you to be able to define the key metrics to optimize and develop a framework to figure out what channels have the highest ROI.  If you like having a daily dashboard and constantly optimizing your experiments to boost the dashboard metrics, this role may be a good fit for you.</p><p>There's substantial latitude and room to define the role and how it grows.  You'll be able to do everything from setting our marketing strategy to experimenting with ads to thinking of product features.  This role will be one of the most critical roles in our company, and will drive a significant amount of what we work on.  We think that we can grow revenue 4x+ in the next year, and we're looking for someone that's excited to tackle that challenge.</p><p>An ideal candidate will have:</p><p> * Deep experience with setting marketing metrics and running experiments<br> * Experience with developing marketing strategy<br> * Experience with ads and SEO<br> * Some management experience</p><p>In this role, you'll be able to see your impact on our students daily.  We hear from students who have been able to finish projects they never dreamed of (usually involving machine learning), who have been hired into exciting new jobs, or who just mastered a concept they never were able to &quot;get&quot; in school.</p><p>Although you don't need to be technical for this role, understanding some data science and SQL is a major plus.  Having analyzed data in the past is a must.</p></div>",

In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, or New York.*</em><br></h4></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><h4>What We Do</h4></div><div>We make websites easier to use. Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>The Senior Growth Product Manager</h4></div><div>As a Senior Growth Product Manager at CROmetrics, you will be a hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to partner with our clients to improve their websites through data-driven experimentation and personalization. A Senior Growth Product Manager spends much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, the Senior Growth Product Manager must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites.</div><div><br></div><div>As a Senior Growth Product Manager, you will be leading all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation</li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment</li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution</li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics</li></ul><div><h4>Who we’re looking for</h4></div><div>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>5+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on consumer-facing web products</li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills</li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas</li><li>Passion for using data to improve user experiences</li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically</li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity</li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups</li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution</li><li>Lifelong learner</li></ul><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li>Matching 401k.</li><li>100% remote, preferably in U.S. time zones – work when and where you want (within reason).</li><li>Liberal vacation policy.</li><li>Performance-based bonuses.</li><li>All the professional gear you need to be successful (e.g. macbook, monitor, and noise-cancelling blackwire headset)</li><li>Workcations throughout the year in such exotic places as Cancun and Aspen.</li></ul><div><h4>Our Culture</h4></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<i>extremely</i>important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<i>improving</i>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and occasionally uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The Senior Growth Product Manager is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the Senior Growth Product Managers have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>At the core of experimentation is the insight to be learned from each test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by experimenting with our own processes and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li></ul><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.&nbsp;Sound like something you are interested in? Read on.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>A unique hiring process – we pay you to interview</h4></div><div>We’ve found that the best candidates shine most when they are able to participate directly with the team and show their skills in action. This does require some work from you, so we’ll pay you to join the team during a “paid interview”.</div><div><br></div><div>Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a paid interview where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal.</div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Interested?

We’re the first travel company in the world that is focussed on mums: the decision-maker in the family when it comes to family holidays. We’re targeting the 8 million UK mums to form a unique and defensible community dedicated to family travel. TimeAway is a marketplace where SuperMums sell family holidays based on their own experiences amongst their networks. We provide SuperMums with the technology to create, share and sell holiday experiences.

We’re a small team so you will have a lot of responsibility from day one. We are the first travel company dedicated to mums and the first to provide a home-based working opportunity for mums. This means you will be spearheading unique marketing campaigns that will require you to think outside the box. <br /><br /><br />About You <br /><br />•    Do you have an entrepreneurial spirit? Are you energized by challenges that stand in your way?<br />•    Are you a self-starter who enjoys a rapid pace and wants to make a difference?<br />•    Do you have the ability to work autonomously and be decisive?<br />•    Are you interested in the travel industry?<br />•    Are you passionate about create new work opportunities for mums?<br /><br /><br />Your Responsibilities <br /><br />•    Ensure our messaging is consistent across all marketing assets <br />•    Build, maintain and implement overall marketing plan which includes campaign pipeline, budget, growth targets, and campaign effectiveness tracking <br />•    Implementing CRM systems <br />•    Work with the team on generation and execution of growth hacking ideas <br />•    Write copy<br />•    Interact with users and decipher their motivations <br />•    Work with our Frontend Developer on creative marketing assets (display ads, emails, etc)<br />•    Manage TimeAway’s social media accounts <br />•    Manage marketing interns<br /><br /><br />Your Skills and Experiences<br /><br />•    3+ years of marketing experience <br />•    2+ years of hands-on marketing experience (e.g., Adwords, events, email marketing, Facebook ads, etc.) <br />•    Experience working with analytics to ensure results-driven marketing <br />•    Proven track record running campaigns on multiple channels <br />•    Experience optimizing acquisition channels <br />•    Excellent English writing and communication skills<br /><br /><br />Benefits<br /><br />•    Become one of the early employees of TimeAway<br />•    Competitive salary packages and stock options<br />•    Think about all the holiday discounts!<br />",

Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>The Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant</h4></div><div>As a Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant at CROmetrics, you will be a hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to partner with our clients to improve their websites through data-driven experimentation and personalization. A Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant spends much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, the Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites.</div><div><br></div><div>As a Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant, you will be leading all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation</li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment</li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution</li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics</li></ul><div><h4>Who we’re looking for</h4></div><div>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>5+ years of professional experience working in digital product management, user experience design or similar roles on consumer-facing web products</li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills</li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas</li><li>Passion for using data to improve user experiences</li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically</li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity</li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups</li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution</li><li>Lifelong learner</li></ul><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>chris@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href='mailto:tom@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>tom@crometrics.com</a>.</em></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li>Matching 401k.</li><li>100% remote, preferably in U.S. time zones – work when and where you want (within reason).</li><li>Liberal vacation policy.</li><li>Performance-based bonuses.</li><li>All the professional gear you need to be successful (e.g. macbook, monitor, and noise-cancelling blackwire headset)</li><li>Workcations throughout the year in such exotic places as Cancun and Aspen.</li></ul><div><h4>Our Culture</h4></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is funded by the company.</li><li><span>Communication is critical.</span>&nbsp;We’re a remote company. That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<i>extremely</i>important. You’ll work closely with engineers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “write specs and close tickets” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<i>improving</i>&nbsp;processes, seeing their ideas and work affect millions of users, and occasionally uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li><li><span>We’re relentlessly focused on our client’s happiness.&nbsp;</span>The Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant is a client-facing role. Managing a client relationship virtually takes a different type of skill set – the Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant have to be both a strategic partner, the customer (represented by the data), teacher and project manager over the phone/email/Slack, all while delivering an exceptional level of service. This type of interaction is not for everyone, and we completely understand. It’s not easy!</li><li><span>We are not perfect.&nbsp;</span>At the core of experimentation is the insight to be learned from each test, whether a win, loss or inconclusive. We extend this concept to everything we do by experimenting with our own processes and fostering an environment of radical candor and constant learning.</li></ul><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.&nbsp;Sound like something you are interested in? Read on.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>A unique hiring process – we pay you to interview</h4></div><div>We’ve found that the best candidates shine most when they are able to participate directly with the team and show their skills in action. This does require some work from you, so we’ll pay you to join the team during a “paid interview”.</div><div><br></div><div>Assuming your submission exceeds expectations, we will reach out to schedule a few informal conversations with our team to learn more about you, and provide an opportunity for you to ask questions of us. If all goes well for both you and CROmetrics, we will hire you for a paid interview where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal.</div><div>Thanks again for your interest in the Senior Marketing Experimentation Consultant position with CROmetrics.

    "content": "Master digital engagement, strengthen brand identity, and craft engaging campaigns.<br /><br />Are you a marketing addict? Do you love taking care of social media channels and exploring all the ways to make a brand explode online? Would it excite you to be part of a self-managing company with a creative culture?<br /><br />If so, read on...<br /><br />GrantTree’s Marketing team is at the dawn of an exciting new phase: we are launching a load of new marketing initiatives and we hope you'll join us for the journey.<br /><br />We are searching for the kind of marketeer who sees digital as the central core of a successful brand, as well as being adept at integrating social media with other traditional marketing activities, in particular events and gifting programmes. Customer engagement is your thing, you know when, where and how to add the ‘magic touches’ that improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.<br />Tasked with developing an exciting plan for our digital engagement strategies, you will create and manage the social media content calendar and coordinate with internal and external content producers to create a distinct, strong and personal flavour across our channels. It will be up to you to research and choose the right networks and channels to draw the most value from existing communities and influencers.<br /><br />We are looking for someone who can get stuck in quickly putting their focus on social media, video, real life events and a sprinkle of marketing support for all of GrantTree. Our environment offers the freedom to seriously grow, and we see the person in this role becoming a super strong marketeer over time - that kind of high-profile professional who is skilled at overseeing multiple channels and campaigns in order to satisfy multiple business needs.<br /><br />Today, you are comfortable with all of these tasks. Tomorrow, you will be someone able to own an entire brand strategy.<br /><br />Requirements<br /><br />- You have created social media strategies from scratch, implementing social video content and paid / ppc campaigns.<br /><br />- Engagement is key for you. You make use of your content production skills and exposure to email marketing to react quickly for maximum effect.<br /><br />- Social Media networks are your natural element and you master them expertly.<br /><br />- You have hands on experience on market research, audience research and targeting.<br /><br />- You are passionate about all things digital and the future of marketing excites you.<br /><br />- You can put together and manage small-scale events such as round tables, small panels, working breakfasts and you ideally have some experience with larger scale events.<br /><br />Benefits<br /><br />We believe that people should be rewarded fairly for the work they do. At GrantTree there is transparency over salaries and the way we work them out. For this role, this is likely to lie between £40k and £50k depending on experience. We also provide access to health insurance, cycle to work, and we have an annual profit sharing scheme for the whole team (which can be taken as shares or cash).<br /><br />Aside from money, we offer a place where you can be yourself. We want you to develop your skills and fulfil your potential. We have a flexible approach to working, and some of our staff work remotely most of the time. Our office near Old Street is bright and airy, with a well-stocked kitchen and a beautiful roof terrace. You can take up to 6 weeks as holiday each year.<br /><br />About Us<br /><br />GrantTree was founded 6 years ago and employs 34 people. In our culture everyone has the freedom, power and trust to do great work. We call this open culture. It’s been successful for us so far, although it's not for everyone (we suggest you check out our GlassDoor reviews). This is the ideal environment for creative, independent people.<br /><br />Equal Opportunities<br /><br />Teams are stronger when they have a diverse range of people. Applications are welcomed from everyone, regardless of the categories they put themselves in. We also encourage talented ‘square pegs’, who don’t neatly fit into the person specification, to apply.<br />Are you excited by GrantTree but not sure about this role? Join our recruitment mailing list to be the first to hear about future opportunities.",
