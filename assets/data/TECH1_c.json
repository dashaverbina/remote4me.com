What's the process?</strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, we will reject your application immediately. If you do follow the directions in this job posting, and we like your resume, we will schedule an introductory interview with you. Additional interviews could occur if we feel you fit our company culture.</p><p><strong>What's with the dishes analogy?</strong></p><p>Doing your dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. Do your dishes.Do you see someone (including us, the Founders) making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p><strong>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</strong></p><p>Right now!

We’re Action Verb.</p><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that Engineering and Marketing professionals use to power their products and services.</p><p>Our products include <a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and <a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><p>Our company consists of 8 full time USA-based Engineers, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America. We’re looking to grow our family by one or two faces.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest engineers and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of <a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong> As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about our Holacracy practice.</a></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that <strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='https://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>Learn more about Open Book Management.</a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four quarterly meetings that are hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, and Detroit.</p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post. <strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb, <strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong> Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully Remote Company!

Everything technology-related will be under your purview. And at least initially, you will be the only person on our team focused on tech full-time.</p><p>Our culture is casual with a start-up feel. We care deeply about efficiency and robust tech, but not how you choose to manage your schedule. We care about our lifestyles but don’t want to dictate yours. You’ll be working remotely but will have constant access to the founders, who will give you feedback and growth.</p><p><strong>Ideal candidate would have:</strong></p><ul><li>Top notch coding skills. You will need to be able write robust, clean code with a focus on extensibility and performance. We use Python throughout, but as tech lead you might decide e.g. Java/C++ is more suitable for a particular solution.</li><li>Experience with hedge fund technology (managing positions, broker data, market data, etc.) a big plus.</li><li>Experience with databases and managing data.</li><li>Experience with configuring and permissioning enterprise apps for a growing organization.</li><li>Experience with integration of back-end systems with Excel. Currently we use PyXLL, a cool system that integrates a Python backend with Excel.</li><li>Strong communication skills and ability to work remotely and manage your own schedule.</li><li>Creativity and being highly proactive in your solutions, passion about tech and coding, and staying well-informed of cool new solutions for tech problems.</li></ul>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote Work                            </div>                    ",

Our team includes employees based on Asia, Europe and America, spanning both timezones and cultures.</p><p>One of the core principles of Igalia is equality, so we feel a deep and continual obligation to acknowledge and counter the structural discrimination that permeates our industry and our world. In a practical sense this means that we have a permanent diversity commission that helps to shape company policy and that maintain a safe and inclusive work environment. We also feel that one of the best ways to accomplish these goals is to grow and maintain the diversity of Igalia itself. We welcome applicants regardless of their age, disability, gender, race, marital status, religion, sexual orientation or whatever type of systemic discrimination that they have faced.</p><p>Send us your CV, accompanied by a brief cover letter by filling the form below.
