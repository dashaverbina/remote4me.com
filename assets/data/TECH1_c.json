We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia.

Your job is to build new services that enhance the customer experience or our internal tooling while maintaining our standards of performance and robustness.</p><p>You'll collaborate closely with our CEO, CTO, DevOps, and Front End engineers to build across our tech stack and deliver best-in-class insurance technology.</p><p>As with all of our engineers, you will test, QA, deploy, and maintain your own code within our continuous integration framework. That means pushing a change to production on your first day, and continuing to improve our services from then on. As you learn, you'll be able to keep the team informed on emerging best practices, and champion ideas you believe in.</p><p><strong><em>We pay competitive salaries.

These three things let us work flexibly because we are consistently improving our forecasting ability and staying motivated to deliver for our members. </p><p>What does that mean for the day-to-day? It means a single team check-in at 9AM PT where you discuss your tasks for the day and any help you will need. Then, you're free to complete that task at your own pace and on your own schedule. We do a weekly retrospective to assess team performance, and a bi-weekly sprint planner. </p><p>Every team seeks to get something out into the wild every day - whether it's a paper prototype or a full deployment to production.</p><p>We take your personal development seriously - the better you are, the better we can deliver for our members and community. As part of your onboarding, we'll discuss your development goals and how we can contribute. That includes everything from blog posts to conferences and sponsored meet-ups. </p><p>Hugo is an EEO employer that actively pursues and hires a diverse workforce, and will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records. Our salaries, perks, and benefits are all negotiable. We don’t judge people based on schools or degrees.</p><h5>Our application process</h5><p>Our goal is to take as little of your time as possible - and be transparent throughout.</p><p>Every candidate answers 3 relevant entry-level questions. Technical and design hires submit 2 portfolio pieces. Please do not send a resume or &quot;about me&quot;.</p><p>If things work out, we will invite you to a 30 minute call where we will discuss your prior experience and future goals, and roles you've enjoyed or found frustrating. </p><p>If that call goes well, we will invite you to a 30 minute call to discuss your area of expertise and work habits.</p><p>From there, you will be provided an area-specific problem to solve in your own time (with as much or as little support from us as desired), followed by a two-on-one review and debrief call. We then check references and prepare to make an offer!</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail.

We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner.

In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors. </span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense. </span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><ul><li><span>React &amp; React Native</span><br><br></li><li><span>Swift &amp; Objective C</span><br><br></li><li><span>Elixir, &nbsp;Phoenix, and Nerves</span><br><br></li><li><span>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</span><br><br></li><li><span>Ethereum / Solidity</span><br><br></li><li><span>Ruby on Rails</span><br><br></li><li><span>Python</span><br><br></li><li><span>Pandas</span><br><br></li><li><span>Serverless</span><br><br></li><li><span>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</span><br></li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><strong>This Role: &nbsp;Senior Software Engineer // Javascript</strong><br></b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><strong><br></strong></b></div><div></div><div><span>Over the past few years, we’ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice.
