We’re Action Verb.</p><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower organizations worldwide.</p><p>Our products include&nbsp;<a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and&nbsp;<a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><p>Our company consists of 15 (but growing to 19 by the end of the year) full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p><strong>Our Success Strategy</strong></p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We Practice Holacracy</strong></p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of&nbsp;<a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong>&nbsp;As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE<span>→</span></a></p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that&nbsp;<strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</p><p><strong>Design Skills We’re Looking For</strong></p><p>This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.</p><p><strong>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) design</li><li>Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles</li><li>Solid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).</li><li>Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.</li><li>History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li></ul><p><strong>Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history</strong>&nbsp;of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.</p><p>We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.</p><p><strong>Some of Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><p><strong>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills.</strong>&nbsp;We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.</p><p><strong>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire.</strong>&nbsp;We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</p><p><strong>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work.</strong>&nbsp;Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.&nbsp;<a href='https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb' rel='nofollow'>Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</a></p><p><strong>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</p><p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p><p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs' rel='nofollow'>READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p><p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p><p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p><p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Ready To Apply?</strong></p><p>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you,&nbsp;<strong>please apply</strong>.</p><p>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?</li><li>How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs?

    "title": "You Need A Budget (YNAB): Humbly Confident UI/UX Designer",
    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><p><span>YNAB is growing, and so is our design team. We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product. </span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements): </span></p><ul><li><span>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design </span><span>at a software company.</span><span> Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</span></li><li><span>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them). </span></li><li><span>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. </span></li></ul><p><span>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span>A Bit About Us</span></h2><p><span>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a><span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></p><p><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></p><p><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> <span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span> has to really </span><span>click</span><span> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you! </span></p><p><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></p><p><span>Who you’d be working with:</span></p><p><span>Todd, </span><span>our Chief Strategy Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and experiences our users have in them—and knows that process begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence </span><span>and </span><span>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span></p><p><span>Alan</span><span>, one of our UI/UX designers, can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills... or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.</span></p><p><span>Dylan </span><span>is the other UI/UX designer at YNAB. He loves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it's a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams' 10 principles of good design on it. He lives in Canada with his girlfriend and six-toed cat named Pawpaw. In his spare time he's probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time. </span></p><p><span>Lauren </span><span>is our illustrator/designer. She is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts, _and_ might be single-handedly responsible for all of the WoW achievement points mentioned on our </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/about/' rel='nofollow'><span>About Page</span></a><span>. We should also mention that she designed and illustrated that page. So yeah, her list of awesome just keeps going and going. Oh, and she writes fantasy novels. Seriously.</span></p><h3><span>How You’ll Work at YNAB</span></h3><p><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></p><p><span>Live Where You Want</span></p><p><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. As I write this, Taylor (our CTO) is in, London or Brazil, or maybe back in Austin? Not all of us travel so extensively, but the fact that he does is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></p><p><span>No Crazy Hours</span></p><p><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></p><p><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></p><p><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span><span>minimum</span><span> vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></p><p><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></p><p><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span> in the mountains, and a beach house in the Outer Banks. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></p><p><span>Up Your Game</span></p><p><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></p><p><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, and all over the United States.)</span><strong></strong></p><p><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></p><p><span>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span><span>and your family.</span><span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span><span>your retirement</span> <span>nest egg</span><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of that awesomeness?)</span></p><p><span>Other Tidbits</span></p><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><span>standing</span><span>?) in front of a computer.</span></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not </span><span>think</span><span> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span></li></ul><p><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. </span><span>You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success.</span><span> You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</span><strong></strong></p><h2><span>Now, back to you, our new UI/UX Designer...</span><strong></strong></h2><h3><span>What Success Looks Like: </span></h3><p><span>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? In 2018, you’ll join our two product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. In 2018, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB </span><span>effortless </span><span>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.</span></p><p><span>You’ll need to: </span><strong></strong></p><ul><li><span>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes. </span></li><li><span>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success. </span></li><li><span>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature. Design reviews during the development process examine form and function and you will see the feature through to the end. </span></li><li><span>Be comfortable iterating with low-fidelity designs and prototypes while working in cross-functional teams made up of developers, marketers, and customer-facing team members (waterfalls are for rivers!), while continuing to pursue a meticulous and thorough design.</span></li><li><span>Communicate and document the styling, user flows, and the impact of your designs on other parts of the system. You’ll update this documentation as feedback comes in and the apps evolve. On the flip side, you’ll provide feedback in design reviews that is clear and helpful in moving our products forward.</span></li><li><span>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done </span><span>in writing. </span><span>Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable writing a first pass at UI copy which is then refined with the help of your team in design reviews. There’s no lorem ipsum here. </span></li><li><span>You are comfortable speaking the language of software development. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!) to help implement your design work, that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement.</span></li><li><span>We use Sketch for the vast majority of design work and maintain a design system using version control in Abstract. You will aide in the expansion and maintenance of the design system and feel comfortable contributing new UI for our applications and website. If you have experience developing and maintaining design systems and can help us strike a balance between fighting for consistency and pushing the design system forward, that’s another plus.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates. </span></li></ul><p><span>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our product: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions. </span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Starting salary will be between $85k and $102k, depending on experience.</span><strong></strong></p><p><span>How to Apply</span></p><p><span><a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0flxd' rel='nofollow'>Apply here*</a> by 11:59PM on </span><span>February 7th, 2018.</span> <span>Firm.

Travel will be up to 5% for professional development conferences, onsite user testing, and or company meetings.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Flexible Work Hours                            </div>                            <div>                                 Remote Work Opportunities                            </div>                            <div>                                 Competitive Salaries                            </div>                            <div>                                 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Awesome Health Insurance                            </div>                            <div>                                 Excellent PTO &amp; Paid Holidays                            </div>                            <div>                                 Casual Business Attire                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid Parental Leave                            </div>                            <div>                                 Forbes Top 100 Best Places to Work 2017 (#7 in IT)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Computerworld's Best Places to Work in IT 2017                            </div>                    ",
