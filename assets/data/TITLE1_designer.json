Stories of how people are being exploited surface on a daily basis, like the recent story about how <a href='https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/your-smartphone-is-making-you-stupid/article37511900/' rel='nofollow'>Instagram withholds like notifications to certain users</a>, with the purpose of increasing the rate of which they open the app. In the same story, The Globe and Mail describe how former <a href='https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/your-smartphone-is-making-you-stupid/article37511900/' rel='nofollow'>high level employees of Facebook are growing a conscience and tell horrifying stories</a> about how features are meticulously being built to exploit human behavior and make us addicts of social media.</p><p>As designers and developers we have an obligation to build experiences that are better than that. This article explains how unethical design happens, and how to do ethical design through a set of best practices. It also helps you understand how you can plant the seed to change the meaning within the company you work for and in the design community, even if you are not part of the management layer. Change starts with a movement!</p><h4>Ethical Design</h4><p>Let’s start with the core terminology: According to <a href='https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic' rel='nofollow'>Merriam Webster</a>, ethics is “the discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation.” For the purpose of this article, ethics will be defined as a system of moral principles that defines what is perceived as good and evil. Ethical design is, therefore, design made with the intent to do good, and unethical design is its black hat counterpart.</p>      <div>      <div>        <p>          Is your pattern library up to date today? <em>Alla Kholmatova</em> has just finished a fully fledged book on <strong>Design Systems</strong> and how to get them right.

It is founded by Aral Balkan and Laura Kalbag who defined an “<a href='https://ind.ie/ethical-design/' rel='nofollow'>Ethical Hierarchy of Needs</a>” that describe the core of ethical design very well.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4bb28749-d346-4d08-8e81-17ede0c2a4df/ethical-design-hierarcy.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        The 'Ethical Hierarchy of Needs' (licensed under <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/' rel='nofollow'>CC BY 4.0</a>) (Source: <a href='https://ind.ie/' rel='nofollow'>ind.ie</a>)            <p>As with any pyramid-shaped structure, the layers in the <em>Ethical Hierarchy of Needs</em> rest on the layer below it. If any layer is broken, the layers resting on top of it will collapse. If a design does not support human rights, it is unethical. If it supports human rights but does not respect human effort by being functional, convenient and reliable (and usable!), then it is <em>unethical</em>. If it respects human effort but does not respect human experience by making a better life for the people using it, then it is still <em>unethical</em>.</p><p>From a practical viewpoint, this means that products and services which exploit user data, use dark patterns and generally are only out to make money, disregarding its human purpose, are unethical. Let’s look at how unethical design manifests itself in business models and design decisions.</p><h4>Unethical Design: The Black Hat Of The Business </h4><h5>Surveillance Capitalism</h5><p>Data-driven design can be used to do good. But more often than not it is used with monetary intent also known as surveillance capitalism.</p><p>As <a href='https://twitter.com/aral' rel='nofollow'>Aral Balkan</a>, ethical designer and founder of <a href='https://ind.ie/' rel='nofollow'>ind.ie</a> puts it:</p><blockquote>“When a company like Facebook improves the experience of its products, it’s like the massages we give to Kobe beef: they’re not for the benefit of the cow but to make the cow a better product. In this analogy, you are the cow.”</blockquote><p>Surveillance capitalism is unethical by nature because at its core, it takes advantage of rich data to profile people and understand their behavior with the sole purpose of making money. The most chilling thought of all is how data is being used not just to predict and manipulate current behavior, but how it is used to profile our future selves through machine learning, ultimately giving companies the power to impact our future decisions and behavioral patterns.</p><p>As Cracked Labs, independent research institute and creative laboratory, states in their report about <a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en/data-against-people' rel='nofollow'>Data Against People</a>:</p><blockquote>“Systems that make <strong>decisions about people</strong> based on their data produce substantial adverse effects that can massively limit their choices, opportunities, and life-chances”.</blockquote><p>This happens on a daily basis to everyone who use Facebook, where the individualized feed is carefully filtered to show the posts most likely to trigger engagement and activity. Pricing is also becoming increasingly individualized because companies are able to use rich data to assess the long-term value of customers, also known as <a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en/corporate-surveillance/info' rel='nofollow'>data-driven persuasion</a>.</p><p>Data trade and data tracking is big business. According to the report “<a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en/corporate-surveillance/#3' rel='nofollow'>Corporate Surveillance in Everyday Life</a>”, Oracle provides access to 5 billion (yes, billion!) unique user ID’s (this is confirmed on <a href='https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/s/dataexplorer/data-providers.html' rel='nofollow'>Oracle’s website</a>). The word “scared” does not cover the emotional state which we should all be in over that fact.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/170938ae-3f05-4571-bff3-67841f2751e1/ethical-design-data-trade.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        An overview of the amount of profiles held by online platforms, credit reporting agencies and consumer data brokers as of June 2017. (Source: <a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en/corporate-surveillance/#3' rel='nofollow'>Corporate Surveillance in Everyday Life</a>, <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/' rel='nofollow'>CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, <a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en' rel='nofollow'>Cracked Labs</a>)            <p>One can only imagine how companies will be able to utilize data to profile which of us are more likely to develop mental health or physical issues, thus putting us in the “no thanks” pile of applications for our future jobs. With this in mind, I fear for the future of my children.</p><p>To some the above sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, but it is not far-fetched at all. Unethical companies are exposed daily, from the <a href='https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-know-smartphones-activity-what-do-not-use-social-network-account-media-privacy-security-a7892761.html' rel='nofollow'>VPN app</a> who claimed to protect the data of their 24 million users, but sold it to Facebook to the software called <a href='http://alphonso.tv/' rel='nofollow'>Alphonso</a> which, according to an <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/media/alphonso-app-tracking.html' rel='nofollow'>article in The New York Times</a>, is used in more than 250 game apps (some of which are designed for children) to monitor what tv ads people watch, even if the app is not in active use. The list of companies who harvest and use data with deeply unethical purposes goes on and on and on.</p><h5>Black Hat Design</h5><p>Nevertheless, data tracking is not the only way that unethical design plays out. <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/' rel='nofollow'>Dark patterns</a> fall under unethical design too, as they are black hat design patterns specifically designed to trick us into doing something we don’t necessarily want to do. It may not be considered unethical when a company makes use of the dark pattern called <em>Roach Motel</em> to make it nearly impossible to delete your account (looking at you, Skype). But looking at the motivation of the business side, it is not hard to see the unethical nature of the design, naming the <a href='https://medium.com/shanghaiist/chinese-shoe-company-tricks-people-into-swiping-instagram-ad-with-fake-strand-of-hair-54d8a2d8ec1d' rel='nofollow'>Chinese shoe company</a> who tricked people to swipe by adding a fake strand of hair on their Instagram ad as just one example.</p>  <div></div><p>Harry Brignull, one of the originators and driving forces behind <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/' rel='nofollow'>Dark Patterns</a>, states that dark patterns work because they take advantage of the human brain’s weaknesses and the way we are hard-wired. That counts as unethical in my book, and we have a moral obligation to the people who design these products to do <em>better</em>.</p><p>Businesses who nurture consumerism and manipulate people into buying more stuff are unethical by design. It is common practice in e-commerce, and it takes advantage of a phenomenon called “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion' rel='nofollow'>loss aversion</a>”. <a href='https://www.hotels.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hotels.com</a> is particularly aggressive, sending several notifications within seconds about how many people have booked and are looking at the same room as you.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a69293cb-38d9-4c21-a639-30b38659ae4a/ethical-design-hotels.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://de.hotels.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hotels.com</a> loves letting us know just how many others are looking at a room to 'motivate' us into booking fast.            <h4>The General Data Protection Regulation</h4><p>The effectuation of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation' rel='nofollow'>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> in late May 2018 will be an efficient tool in the fight against companies that are unethical by design.</p><p>GDPR is an extensive regulation that amongst the highlights include:</p><ul><li>The requirement of any organization that collects data to do so in a secure manner by design;</li><li>Heavy fines for data breaches;</li><li>Data must only be collected after explicit consent, and the language used to explain why the data is collected must be plain and simple. In addition, consent must be withdrawable at any time and must be as easy to do as it was giving it (which, by the way, includes <code>Sign up</code> → <code>Delete profile</code>);</li><li>“The right to be forgotten,” meaning that people have the right to have their data deleted;</li><li>The right for people to get access to their personal data in any organization, alongside information about how this data is processed;</li><li>Data portability, meaning that people have the right to get hold of their data in one company and transfer it to another company;</li><li>Heavy fines for non-compliance of GDPR.</li></ul><p>All in all, May 25, 2018, is a pretty good day for the people, and a sign of a much different future for all the unethically designed organizations out there.</p><p>But let’s not kid ourselves and think that change will happen overnight or across all organizations in a heartbeat. A deeper change is needed in order to make that happen over time.</p><h4>Change Happens Through Change Of Meaning</h4><p>GDPR is not likely to solve all of our problems. Believing that would be naive. That’s why it will continue to be up to the people within company walls to make a difference. The good news is that making a change is possible even if you’re not part of the management team who decides on the business model.</p><p>This type of change towards a more ethical design approach is not claimed to happen overnight. Rather, it is possible to make changes incrementally and foster long-term, organizational change through what Don Norman and Roberto Verganti call Meaning-driven Innovation (read more in their article about “<a href='http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/Norman%20&amp;%20Verganti.%20Design%20Research%20&amp;%20Innovation-18%20Mar%202012.pdf' rel='nofollow'>Incremental and Radical Innovation</a>”).</p><p>Meaning-driven innovation is a result of people starting to articulate new thoughts that create new dynamics, which ultimately lead to radically new meanings.</p><p>Don Norman and Roberto Verganti say that radical innovation only happens when one of the following things occur:</p><ol><li>A new enabling technology is available in a reliable, economical form (it took 20 years for touch interfaces to exit the labs and enter the phone and tablet market);</li><li>When the meaning of something changes in society — also referred to as meaning-driven innovation.</li></ol><p>I think that the increasing awareness, focus, and concern about our privacy in respect to data-driven businesses will in a not so distinct future spark radical innovation and change in society. Ironically, the companies who founded surveillance capitalism have also sparked a change in how we perceive our right to privacy, and we are already starting to see companies and organizations innovate and foster privacy driven solutions.</p><p>The meaning of companies who track and surveil us is already changing. We used to not think very hard about, and maybe even find it convenient when ads served on Facebook were based on our browsing history. But with the escalation of surveillance capitalism, I will argue that we are going through a meaning change as an increasing mass of people are finding it not only uncomfortable but directly unacceptable to be spied on in the name of a business.</p><p><a href='https://duckduckgo.com/' rel='nofollow'>DuckDuckGo</a>, a search engine that doesn’t track, had an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo#Traffic' rel='nofollow'>average of 16 million search queries per day in 2017</a>, a sign that privacy is an increasing concern among people when using the web. Also, we are seeing apps devoted to privacy reaching markets, such as <a href='https://signal.org/' rel='nofollow'>Signal</a>, a secure phone and messenger app designed to protect privacy. Furthermore, it is highly likely that GDPR will spark further meaning change related to privacy.</p><h4>Transition To A Human-Centered Design Approach</h4><p>Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a philosophy developed by Don Norman (among others). According to the <a href='https://uxpa.org/' rel='nofollow'>User Experience Professionals Association</a> (UXPA), HCD is defined by “the active involvement of users and a clear understanding of user and task requirements”.</p><p>Don Norman and Roberto Verganti conclude in their substantial study that HCD is only suitable for incremental innovation — step by step improvements — because new ideas are not discovered while constantly looking at the existing state of things as it is done through user research.</p><p>While this sounds reasonable, I believe that HCD can prove to be the offset to meaning-driven innovation, ultimately leading to a broad meaning change about what people will accept and won’t accept from unethical organizations. The reason why I believe this, is that HCD fosters a deeper sense of empathy than any other experience design method.</p><p>Human-Centered Design is a framework as well as a mindset. At its core, working “human-centered” means involving the people you serve early and continuously in the process, i.e. using research to establish the needs of these people, understanding what problems they have, and how your product can help solve these problems.</p><p>It falls within the natural sphere of experience designers to work human-centered, but what do you do if your job is in design and development, and you are constantly occupied by sprint reviews and daily tasks?</p><p>While working with a remote development team, I learned that the developers didn’t have any contact with the people who used the product. This often led to heated discussions where statements like “I think…”, “From a technical perspective…”, and “I feel…” were the main arguments.</p><p>The biggest problem with basing decisions on what you think and feel, or what is easiest from a technical perspective, is that it doesn’t involve the people you are serving. The people who your product or service is put in the world to solve problems for. That’s where HCD comes in.</p><p>UX designers and researchers typically conduct research, document the insights and bring them forward in a refined state to the design- and product team in the shape of personas, user needs descriptions, user flows, journeys, and so on. And that’s all well and good. The problem is, however, that the distance between the organisation and people you serve remains large, because no one except the UX designers talked to them or have seen them use the product. So they keep going back to “I feel…”, “I think…” and “From a technical perspective…”</p><p>To help establish empathy towards the people you serve, there are a couple of very impactful things designers and developers — and the rest of the organization — can do (and can ask for from the UX team).</p><ol>    <li><strong>Involve all team members in watching videos from user testing sessions.</strong><br>Actually going through the pains and delights of the people who use your products (or prototypes, depending on what you’re testing) is worth every second. It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to watch other people interact with and comment on the stuff you’re building (and no, your team doesn't count as “people” here!).<br><br>If this is not part of the routine in your company, ask for it to be included. Certainly, the vast majority of UX designers who would not be thrilled to organize and facilitate such sessions. You are guaranteed to go through pain, agony, frustration, happiness and get multiple eye openers, and it will all serve as the stepping stone towards growing a human-centered mindset.</li>    <li><strong>Ask for actual, living portraits of the people you serve.</strong><br>This includes photos and video from contextual studies (link), stories from their daily life and stories about them. Getting a deeper sense of the people on the other side of the product you develop creates instant empathy and makes it a lot harder to design things that knowingly are bad for them.</li>    <li><strong>Insist on continuous testing.</strong><br>It cannot be emphasized enough how crucial testing is in HCD. This includes early proof of concept tests, prototype tests, and usability tests. A side bonus of early and continuous involvement from the people who are meant to use the product is that it saves money in the long run. The earlier you realize a bad call or error, the cheaper it is to fix.<br><br>A lot has been said about the nuclear alarm that was triggered by mistake in Hawaii on January 13. However, it’s pretty safe to say that early and continuous testing would have helped prevent it.<br>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f1258cce-f17d-41e4-9374-6f087a651794/ethical-design-hawaii.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        A poorly designed screen has been named the cause of a false ballistic missile alert in Hawaii. (Source: <a href='https://twitter.com/civilbeat/status/953127542050795520' rel='nofollow'>Honolulu Civil Beat</a>)            </li><li><strong>Always ask “why?”</strong><br>To start a change of meaning in an organization or community, the first important step is to start asking “why.” Ask why something is being done unethically; ask why you are told to make a black hat feature; question the current state of things.<br><br>Ask on what grounds design decisions are being made. If it’s because of what the CEO or someone else thinks, and it has no root in insights from the people you are serving, ask for that validation. Meaning change grows through small steps.</li></ol><h4>Ethical Design Best Practices</h4><p>Alongside establishing a human-centered design tradition in the organization, it is also important to make use of the best practices of ethical design. People who do so are part of taking the lead and showing the rest of the organization how things can be done in a more ethical way, all of which will add to the incremental meaning change. Just as dark patterns fall under unethical design, we have White Hat design patterns that can be utilized to ensure ethical design, some of which you can learn about in the following.</p><h5>Use Data To Improve The Human Experience</h5><p>Despite numerous companies using data for unethical purposes, such as increasing consumption and traffic, data can, in fact, be used to actually improve the human experience.</p><p>This is the case on the <a href='https://ind.ie/' rel='nofollow'>ind.ie</a> forum where setting up an account is suggested as a way to customize your experience by remembering what you’ve read.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2e353509-58d4-4e0b-b759-842d1361aac6/ethical-design-indie.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://ind.ie/' rel='nofollow'>ind.ie</a>'s forum highlights the benefits of setting up an account — one that won’t harvest your data and use it unethically.            <p>In a current project in which I am involved in making an app for students to more easily access their Learning Management System, we are sorting the student’s individual courses by “last visited”; we know through research that the students most often revisit a small number of pages that relate to the courses they are currently enrolled in. This customization is not designed to change behavior or nudge them into using parts of the app they didn’t intend to. Instead, it is designed to make their experience faster and more efficient.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/46eefbc4-bd90-49f3-ab1b-23d6aeeae473/ethical-design-student-app.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        In this early wireframe from a current project, it it shown how we used knowledge about current usage of the product to increase efficiency in the app by sorting the student’s courses by 'last visited'.            <p>Another positive example is the American pharmacy <a href='https://www.walgreens.com/' rel='nofollow'>Walgreens</a>, who sends out reminders when it’s time to refill on things like vitamins. This is an extremely helpful feature that solves a problem a lot of us have.</p><p>Data can help inform research initiatives to understand how you’re not tackling the problems people have when interacting with your product.</p><p><a href='https://www.skyscanner.net/' rel='nofollow'>Skyscanner</a>, a travel search engine, noticed through their data that their newly launched design didn’t go down well for the people who used their service to fly out of Amsterdam. That data helped inform a research initiative that ultimately lead to a customized solution for people flying to and from Amsterdam that broke down the barriers the new design had initially built (here’s the <a href='https://hackernoon.com/look-at-your-product-from-a-new-perspective-f0709760614b' rel='nofollow'>background story</a>).</p><h5>Advertising Without Tracking</h5><p>Advertising is not necessarily unethical. Advertising based on granular data is. It is careless (if not stupid) to rely on a single platform for the majority of a brand’s marketing efforts, especially considering that said platform owns and controls the data the brand uses as the foundation for its ad targeting.</p><p>Facebook, Instagram, and Google care just about as little about their advertisers as they do about the people who they see as “users,” i.e. they can make any change they want to, disregarding any consequences it might have for people or businesses using their platform. For example, there was a time when they started blocking fake accounts en masse, which hurt numerous companies whose social media admins had set up fake accounts to administer business pages because they (understandably) didn’t want to use their private accounts for this purpose. This is standard procedure from Facebook who <a href='https://www.facebook.com/terms' rel='nofollow'>only allows one profile per person</a> (likely because allowing several would contaminate their data tracking).</p><p>The platform is always the weakest link in a marketing strategy because it is a third party beyond the control of companies. Thinking back to the 90’s when I worked in marketing at a regional newspaper, granular data tracking was not an option. When a store had placed an ad in the paper about an event, they would simply monitor how many people showed up, and compare that to their expectations to determine the success rate.</p><p>While “the good old days” were certainly not good in all aspects, the thought of not basing advertising on granular user data tracking is an appealing thought. John Gruber’s blog, <a href='https://daringfireball.net' rel='nofollow'>Daring Fireball</a> is an example of a site that doesn’t allow ad tracking. Instead, John Gruber encourages advertisers to add a custom link to their ads enabling them to monitor the click rate on their end.</p><p>As John Gruber rightfully states:</p><blockquote>“If you pay (say) Facebook for an ad, why in the world would you, the advertiser, trust Facebook’s numbers for how the ad performed?”<br><br>— <a href='https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/df_display_ads' rel='nofollow'>Source</a></blockquote><p>Another great example worth highlighting is <a href='https://www.goodwings.com/en-us' rel='nofollow'>Goodwings</a>, a hotel booking site that donates half of their commission to charity. They can do so because of a close collaboration with a large number of NGO’s which means they spend very little on traditional marketing.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fb1a5ade-edf2-4257-835d-1d10f93fb624/ethical-design-goodwings.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://www.goodwings.com/en-us' rel='nofollow'>Goodwings</a> is a hotel search engine that donates half of their commission to charity.            <p>And if you think Google Analytics is your only option for collecting meaningful data, think again: <a href='https://matomo.org/' rel='nofollow'>Matamo</a> is an open source tool that is installed directly on your own server. It guarantees that data is not shared with advertising agencies such as Google.</p><h4>Always, Always Prioritize Usability</h4><p>Surveillance capitalism and data tracking are heavily talked about problems related to ethical design these days. But we must not forget the importance of complying with the best practices of usability. Without it, design is unethical, as a lack of usability almost always entails the use of dark patterns. A good place to go to read more about core usability is <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/' rel='nofollow'>Nielsen Norman Group</a>.</p><p>Back in the early days, Jakob Nielsen defined 5 core components of usability:</p><ul><li>Learnability,</li><li>Efficiency,</li><li>Memorability</li><li>Errors, and</li><li>Satisfaction.</li></ul><p>To ensure a usable product, it’s crucial that these five components are front and center in the design and development process.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8a1486fe-7a36-4e46-9588-881d2608f0a7/ethical-design-usability.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        While it may not be the most interesting 404 page around, <a href='https://www.apple.com/404' rel='nofollow'>Apple’s version</a> focuses on error prevention by offering us a forward path when we hit a lost page.            <p></p><h5>Don’t Ask For More Than You Need</h5><p>As with many other aspects in life, asking for more than you need results in exploitation. It’s common for e-commerce sites to ask for tons of information when people sign up for an account or buy a product. But if someone is buying a digital product (such as a book), there really is no need to ask for anything other than their email address.</p><p><a href='https://signal.org/' rel='nofollow'>Signal</a> is a great example. Private at its core, it doesn’t ask for anything more than the information that is absolutely necessary for people to start using the app right away.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a5c39747-ea0d-4756-a44f-bbd02f6f6523/ethical-design-signal.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://signal.org/' rel='nofollow'>Signal</a> only asks for the phone number of the device during signup.            <h5>Be Transparent</h5><p><a href='https://www.norwegian.com/' rel='nofollow'>Norwegian.com</a> has perhaps one of the best airfare booking systems in the world. Not only is it convenient to use but they also offer full transparency in relation to their optional service fees, something that is often hidden away. Anyone who lives outside of an Amazon storage country knows how hard it is to find the actual delivery price of their location.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bc539d50-3e47-4ac7-a8a0-a2fd08d39346/ethical-design-norwegian.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://www.norwegian.com/' rel='nofollow'>Norwegian.com</a> offers full transparency on all additional charges.            <h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The movement towards a more ethical future has begun. Change doesn’t happen radically short term unless it’s built into the core of the business model. But that doesn’t mean we cannot change the current state for the better. We can do so through incremental change; one step at a time. By working human-centered, by asking why, and by using best practices for ethical design. That’s our obligation as the ones who build products so deeply ingrained in people’s lives. What we do changes and shapes lives for better or for worse. I choose better.</p><h5>Learn More</h5><p>There are a lot of valuable resources available for anyone interested in ethical design.

We're looking for a Design Manager to help manage and grow our Platform Design Team at Zapier. Are you excited to foster a user-centered design culture in 100% remote company? Then keep reading!</div><div><br></div><div><h3>About You</h3></div><div><b><span>You put your teammate's and customer's needs first.</span>&nbsp;</b>You enjoy helping and enabling designers do great work. You set design strategy by aligning business strategy and our user's needs. You use data and user research to make human-centered design decisions. You challenge assumptions about what makes a design successful through encouraging divergent exploration and talking to users.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You're technically inclined.</b></span>&nbsp;The Platform team is responsible for all of the apps on Zapier. Notably, we have over 1000 partners who create, test, launch, maintain, and improve apps on the Zapier platform – and add dozens every month. The Platform is unique inside Zapier. They have&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;users: the end-users who use the apps on Zapier and the developers/partners building the apps. Serving both users effectively requires getting to know some of the technical inner-workings to help your team design effective solutions.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>You wear many hats.</span>&nbsp;</b>You are constantly learning and leveling up your management skills. You have the relevant design skills to build rapport with the Design Team. On a regular basis you can expect to be holding one on ones with designers, thinking through tricky design problems, reviewing design iterations, and helping prioritize design needs across the company that align with our business strategy.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>You have experience hiring and managing UX Researchers and Designers.</span>&nbsp;</b>This isn't your first rodeo. You may not have hired or managed hundreds of people before, but you have hired, trained and managed before.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You love collaboration and feedback.</b></span>&nbsp;You understand successful design doesn't happen in a vacuum or in secret. You believe in sharing work early, openly, and often. You enjoy working closely with Product Managers, Engineers, Data Scientists, and Customers to help make the Design Team's designs achieve effective results.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You know how design impacts development.</b></span>&nbsp;You've built functional web apps before. You understand the technical complexities a design might introduce, and can work through them with your teammates. You don't believe in “tossing designs over the wall,” and would dread doing so.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Things You Might Do</h3></div><div>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, your primary goal is to help achieve better design outcomes and here are some things you'll probably do:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Hold weekly one on ones with members of the Platform Design Team (Product Designers and UX Researchers).</li><li>Build rapport with each member of the Platform Design Team and work hard to help them level up their skills</li><li>Collaborate with platform leadership to understand business strategy and apply it to your team's work</li><li>Work to serve developers, product managers, and business development teams at our 1000+ partner organizations</li><li>Collaborate across functions to help set roadmaps that will achieve business goals through design</li><li>Advocate for and teach design skills across the organization. Find ways to involve non-designers in the design process through design sprints and other creative means</li><li>Help champion our Zapier design standards and visual identity</li><li>Provide feedback on design solutions through wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes</li><li>Participate in user research and other experiments to inform design decisions</li><li>Give, seek, and receive thoughtful critical feedback</li><li>Give back to the community via open source, blog posts, and&nbsp;<a href='https://dribbble.com/zapier?utm_source=zapier.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=zapier' rel='nofollow'>sharing design team work</a></li><li>Help recruit, onboard and train new Design Team members at Zapier</li><li>Help customers via All Hands Support to learn about Zapier and the product</li></ul><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p><a href='https://zapier.workable.com/j/E51078ADCA' rel='nofollow'>https://zapier.workable.com/j/E51078ADCA</a></p>  </div>",

That's where you come in.</p><p>As our first full-time Design hire, you’ll help define the way our product looks, acts, and sounds. You’ll produce assets at varying levels of fidelity across a wide variety of media, from paper sketches to interactive prototypes, chatbot tone to outdoor billboards.</p><p>You’ll collaborate closely with our Heads of Product, Technology, and Marketing to produce nuanced assets which reflect careful analysis of products that our community loves and hates, ground research, internal data, and your own inspiration.</p><p>We’re looking for a Senior Designer who is passionate, resourceful, and has a history of listening closely to discover what users need.

We do code reviews, we don’t merge into mainstream any substantial code without being reviewed and approved.</p><p>For all the above reasons we are a teal organization. What does it mean?</p><p>Everyone at Cycloid meets once every quarter at our in France to define collectively the strategy/road map/features for the coming quarter. Then, everyone defines their own agenda and priorities that to achieve his own goal.</p><p>We are fully transparent on revenues, salaries and believe that everybody should have the same variable plan.</p><p>We have signed millions since our creation in April 2015, we are 100% self-funded and have neither external investors nor bank credits.</p><p>We take the time that we need to build useful products and provide great services.</p><h5>SKILLS</h5><p>You are a passionate software engineer, which is the most important, with years of experience crafting software and UI /UX expertise, would be better but not necessary. Skills are one thing, the behaviour is what is the most important. </p><p>You prefer and want to focus on the nowadays web frontend development, where frontends aren’t any more a simple mirror of information.You have some knowledge and experience with some backend development, would be better, so you can have an overall understanding of it.</p><p>Because you are focused on the frontend, you know how to build UIs which look professional, are usable and made with a little bit of passion, with passion it's always better.</p><p>Meanwhile, our current frontend is in VueJS, if you love VueJS you really should speak with us. We don’t require that you have any experience with it, but we expect that you have experience with frontend frameworks and you can show us that you understand the web mechanics, not only knowing the framework surface.</p><p>We are looking for a person who can build with us new features, can bring some new ideas on what could be a great DevOps platform/pipeline to simplify the work of others. If you don't have any ideas, it will be a challenge because we don't have a product manager and we are trying to work without it due to our culture. We want to empower people.</p><p>You are, of course, a team player and know how to work in remote even if you can work at Cycloid office in Paris if you are in Paris. You can also decide to work on remote. Our organization is in an asynchronous manner, keeping a good team culture through Slack and conference meetings.</p><p>You have adequate written and oral communication skills in English, any others languages would be a plus.</p><p>The salary will depend on your skills and your localization.</p><p><em>Cycloid is committed to having equality between women and men. In that way, we strongly encourage women's application.</em></p><p><strong>What do we expect that you send to us?</strong></p><p>Your CV or a LinkedIn profile or a personal website where we can know more about your professional experience and public portfolio.

We’re Action Verb.</p><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower organizations worldwide.</p><p>Our products include&nbsp;<a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and&nbsp;<a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><p>Our company consists of 15 (but growing to 19 by the end of the year) full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p><strong>Our Success Strategy</strong></p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We Practice Holacracy</strong></p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of&nbsp;<a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong>&nbsp;As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE<span>→</span></a></p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that&nbsp;<strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</p><p><strong>Design Skills We’re Looking For</strong></p><p>This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.</p><p><strong>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) design</li><li>Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles</li><li>Solid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).</li><li>Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.</li><li>History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li></ul><p><strong>Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history</strong>&nbsp;of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.</p><p>We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.</p><p><strong>Some of Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><p><strong>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills.</strong>&nbsp;We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.</p><p><strong>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire.</strong>&nbsp;We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</p><p><strong>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work.</strong>&nbsp;Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.&nbsp;<a href='https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb' rel='nofollow'>Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</a></p><p><strong>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</p><p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p><p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs' rel='nofollow'>READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p><p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p><p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p><p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Ready To Apply?</strong></p><p>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you,&nbsp;<strong>please apply</strong>.</p><p>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?</li><li>How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs? Is there anything you would add or change?</li><li>Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?</li><li>Are you familiar with Holacracy? Any questions or concerns?</li><li>What’s lacking in your current work arrangement that we could improve?</li><li>What are your philosophies on design?</li><li>What does designing great software look like?</li></ul><p>We look forward to reading your letter!</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully Remote Company!

    "title": "You Need A Budget (YNAB): Humbly Confident UI/UX Designer",
    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><p><span>YNAB is growing, and so is our design team. We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product. </span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements): </span></p><ul><li><span>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design </span><span>at a software company.</span><span> Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</span></li><li><span>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them). </span></li><li><span>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. </span></li></ul><p><span>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span>A Bit About Us</span></h2><p><span>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a><span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></p><p><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></p><p><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> <span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span> has to really </span><span>click</span><span> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you! </span></p><p><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></p><p><span>Who you’d be working with:</span></p><p><span>Todd, </span><span>our Chief Strategy Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and experiences our users have in them—and knows that process begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence </span><span>and </span><span>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span></p><p><span>Alan</span><span>, one of our UI/UX designers, can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills... or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.</span></p><p><span>Dylan </span><span>is the other UI/UX designer at YNAB. He loves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it's a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams' 10 principles of good design on it. He lives in Canada with his girlfriend and six-toed cat named Pawpaw. In his spare time he's probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time. </span></p><p><span>Lauren </span><span>is our illustrator/designer. She is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts, _and_ might be single-handedly responsible for all of the WoW achievement points mentioned on our </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/about/' rel='nofollow'><span>About Page</span></a><span>. We should also mention that she designed and illustrated that page. So yeah, her list of awesome just keeps going and going. Oh, and she writes fantasy novels. Seriously.</span></p><h3><span>How You’ll Work at YNAB</span></h3><p><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></p><p><span>Live Where You Want</span></p><p><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. As I write this, Taylor (our CTO) is in, London or Brazil, or maybe back in Austin? Not all of us travel so extensively, but the fact that he does is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></p><p><span>No Crazy Hours</span></p><p><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></p><p><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></p><p><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span><span>minimum</span><span> vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></p><p><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></p><p><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span> in the mountains, and a beach house in the Outer Banks. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></p><p><span>Up Your Game</span></p><p><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></p><p><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, and all over the United States.)</span><strong></strong></p><p><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></p><p><span>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span><span>and your family.</span><span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span><span>your retirement</span> <span>nest egg</span><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of that awesomeness?)</span></p><p><span>Other Tidbits</span></p><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><span>standing</span><span>?) in front of a computer.</span></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not </span><span>think</span><span> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span></li></ul><p><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. </span><span>You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success.</span><span> You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</span><strong></strong></p><h2><span>Now, back to you, our new UI/UX Designer...</span><strong></strong></h2><h3><span>What Success Looks Like: </span></h3><p><span>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? In 2018, you’ll join our two product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. In 2018, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB </span><span>effortless </span><span>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.</span></p><p><span>You’ll need to: </span><strong></strong></p><ul><li><span>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes. </span></li><li><span>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success. </span></li><li><span>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature. Design reviews during the development process examine form and function and you will see the feature through to the end. </span></li><li><span>Be comfortable iterating with low-fidelity designs and prototypes while working in cross-functional teams made up of developers, marketers, and customer-facing team members (waterfalls are for rivers!), while continuing to pursue a meticulous and thorough design.</span></li><li><span>Communicate and document the styling, user flows, and the impact of your designs on other parts of the system. You’ll update this documentation as feedback comes in and the apps evolve. On the flip side, you’ll provide feedback in design reviews that is clear and helpful in moving our products forward.</span></li><li><span>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done </span><span>in writing. </span><span>Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable writing a first pass at UI copy which is then refined with the help of your team in design reviews. There’s no lorem ipsum here. </span></li><li><span>You are comfortable speaking the language of software development. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!) to help implement your design work, that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement.</span></li><li><span>We use Sketch for the vast majority of design work and maintain a design system using version control in Abstract. You will aide in the expansion and maintenance of the design system and feel comfortable contributing new UI for our applications and website. If you have experience developing and maintaining design systems and can help us strike a balance between fighting for consistency and pushing the design system forward, that’s another plus.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates. </span></li></ul><p><span>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our product: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions. </span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Starting salary will be between $85k and $102k, depending on experience.</span><strong></strong></p><p><span>How to Apply</span></p><p><span><a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0flxd' rel='nofollow'>Apply here*</a> by 11:59PM on </span><span>February 7th, 2018.</span> <span>Firm.

Our goal is to put design at the focus of our product &amp; brand and we are looking for the right person to take on that challenge.<br /><br />**How we work**<br /><br />The engineering team is led by Pedro. Pedro loves building things from scratch (especially electric Skateboards and lately, building a fully electric bus), cryptocurrencies, and tweeting about Elon Musk.<br /><br />The product team is led by our co-founder Max, who loves Bayern Munich football club, Pirate Metrics and listening to Pedro talk about Elon Musk.<br /><br />We work remotely across a shared timezone and are focused on building new products from scratch and running a continuous growth process.<br /><br />We are building a product-focused culture and despite working remotely, try to get together in Lisbon, or London, once a quarter to work together for a week (and also spend some time together listening to Pedro talk about Elon Musk - he really likes Elon).<br /><br />You will be working directly with Pedro and Max, speaking to users, redesigning existing features, running quick iterative tests and building new products. Additionally, you will take lead on owning and updating the brand &amp; messaging.<br /><br />**Who we are looking for**<br /><br />We are looking for someone with 2-3 years of experience in UX / UI design at a technology business. We focus on aptitude over skill - what we look for the most is that you are eager to learn and take on new challenges, and have a keen eye for beautiful products &amp; brands.<br /><br />Additionally, we are looking for team members who are excited about the Obby mission, providing independent teachers with a platform to share their skills and generate an income doing what they love.",
