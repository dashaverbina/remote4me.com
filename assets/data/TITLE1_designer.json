We are looking for team members to help us develop world class software products for the most exclusive organizations in the world. We have been at this for seventeen years, and continue to grow off our best asset, our people.</p><p>In this role you will have significant responsibility in one of our project development teams to ensure client satisfaction by executing on the deliverables.</p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>Clevertech looks for craftsmen developers who take ownership of their designs. You can deliver quickly while being clever to avoid missteps. You have an effective positive attitude that shines as you show your care about client and colleague concerns. You are always learning and are a transparent communicator even when it is challenging. You thrive on challenging yourself daily and seek to surround yourself with like minded individuals.</p><p>You understand good UX and good UI and what that means and love to create successful designs (that delight customers) and you can successfully bring a whole concept from idea to wireframe, to mockup/prototype and have the deliverables to prove it. You have worked in significant mobile projects and have participated in the full design cycle to deliver world class, pixel perfect designs.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p><strong>Own Your Time</strong></p><p>We are a completely remote team. That means we have a large amount of trust and a lot of flexibility. World travelers, young parents, nature lovers, and commute avoiders love working here. We also will pay for a co-working space in case you feel like working outside of your normal setting.</p><p><strong>Recharge Time</strong></p><p>We insist that you take recharge time. We are closed for major holidays and then require that you take at least two weeks a year to refresh.</p><p><strong>Care For Yourself</strong></p><p>You’ll receive a health/wellness monthly stipend that goes towards covering medical insurance, dental insurance or joining a gym!</p><p><strong>Focused Work</strong></p><p>You will work together on a dedicated team with your eye on one finish line at a time. Our teams are nimble and agile, and cover the technical range you would expect in world class product delivery teams.</p><p><strong>Learn at your edges</strong></p><p>We believe in learning and provide unique programs that improve your tech skills, leadership skills and even challenge you in personal development. CleverFridays, guest speakers, mentorship opportunities and in-depth industry exposure are all on offer here. And of course, if you speak at a tech conference, we cover all expenses.</p><p><strong>Clevertech Swag</strong></p><p>And keep your eye on the mail - we send out swag everywhere in the world and there are celebratory pictures of Clevertech socks, hoodies, and mugs all over Slack.</p><p>Want to learn more about Clevertech and the team?

We had what can only be called a very strong response — both in number and in passion.</p><p>First, we winnowed out the podcasts that were on a broader theme (e.g. creativity, mentoring, leadership), on a narrower theme (e.g. on one specific WordPress theme) or on a completely different theme (e.g. car maintenance — I’m sure it was well-intentioned).</p><p>When we filtered out those that had produced no new content in the last three months or more (although then we did have to make some exceptions, as you’ll see), and ordered the rest according to how many times they were nominated, we had a graded shortlist of 55.</p><p>Agreed, that’s not a very short shortlist.</p><p>So, we broke it down into five more reasonably sized shortlists:</p><ul><li><a rel='nofollow'>Podcasts for web developers</a></li><li><a rel='nofollow'>Podcasts for web designers</a></li><li><a rel='nofollow'>Podcasts on the web, the Internet and technology</a></li><li><a rel='nofollow'>Business podcasts for web professionals</a></li><li><a rel='nofollow'>Podcasts that don’t have recent episodes (but do have great archives)</a></li></ul><p>Obviously, it’s highly unlikely anyone could — or would want to — listen to every episode of every one of these podcasts. Still, we’re pretty sure that any web designer or developer will find a few podcasts in this lot that will suit their particular listening tastes.</p>    <div>      <div>    <p>Getting workflow <em>just</em> right ain't an easy task.

    "content": "Role: Designer, Heist Studios<br />Reporting to: Art Director<br />Location: Clerkenwell, London<br /><br />Our vision<br /><br />At Heist, we believe underwear can be an instrument of progress. While many industries understand our era’s desire for autonomy, choice and freedom, women’s underwear has lagged behind. Effectively, all women are living in underwear inadequate to their time.  <br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in underwear design can ensure that every woman, every day, is living in underwear that allows her to progress in the way that she demands in every other area of her life. That’s why our designs are built on an understanding of how bodies move, not just how they look.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane wardrobe staple, a pair of tights, into a product that redefines superiority in comfort and fit for every female body. We’re now using polymer physics, computational engineering models and 3D knitwear to reinvent shapewear. Next, we’ll be taking our design ethos to make a bra that actually fits. (Finally!)<br /><br />Our journey<br /><br />We may be only two years old, but it’s already been quite a ride. Our first range reinvented the humble pair of tights, delivering 30% month-on-month growth and propelling us into the pages of almost every major European publication. We’re backed by some of the biggest investors in fashion and technology, and on a busy day, we can sell a pair of tights every 15 seconds. Even our tube adverts caused a scandal. Most importantly, we have tens of thousands of customers who genuinely love Heist and the products we develop and ship around the world. We are continually growing and creating a creative brand that not just looks good, but also tell a story.    <br />Your responsibilities<br /><br />As Designer, you will work on a range of tasks from designing emails and banners to advertising, across both print and digital. You will be working within our Creative team, supporting them on day to day tasks as we continue to grow.<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />•    Design work for new banner ads, print and web material.<br />•    Be able to constantly think of new designs to push Heist forward.<br />•    Ability to take ownership of design projects across multiple platforms both online and offline.<br />•    Provide final artwork across a wide range of projects, from print advertising through to display ads and social posts. This will include repurposing of existing assets.<br />•    Work with external partners and agencies<br />•    Support the creation of conceptual designs for new projects<br />•    Refresh existing email, print and advertising templates with relevant imagery and copy. <br /><br /> Your experience<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people come from a wide range of backgrounds, but we would expect that you have:<br /><br />•    Advanced knowledge of studio software, including Adobe Creative Suite InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop and skills in all other Creative Suite programs.<br />•    An outstanding awareness of current design trends.<br />•    A brilliant understanding of typography and layout and a good understanding of the print process.<br />•    Thorough understanding of asset supply requirements across all media disciplines<br />•    Past experience in retouching is a nice to have <br />•    The ability to work collaboratively within a team with other creatives and have the ability to take creative direction from the Art Director to bring design concepts to life when necessary.<br />•    Exceptional attention to detail<br />•    An excellent eye and passion for design.<br />•    The ability to meet deadlines without compromising quality<br />•    Creative agency experience is desirable <br /><br />You<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Heist. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br />•    You deeply care about Heist’s mission; you have a desire to build something iconic, that will disrupt an industry, and women’s lives.<br />•    You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them. <br />•    You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />•    You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />•    You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.",

We’re here to change that, and we need your help.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We started out in 2010 with an email subscription form, a YouTube account, and a lot of scrambling to figure things out. Even with over 40,000 clients in 80 countries, pretty much everything about how we’ve built our company and marketed our products has been bootstrapped by a small group of deeply invested people wearing a lot of hats and learning as we went along. Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</div><div><br></div><div>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and we are looking for a UX / UI Designer to join GMB. You’ll be part of a team that is helping to imagine and build new products — as well as improve existing ones.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>What will be your responsibilities?</h3></div><ul><li>Design and take ownership for the user experience of our products — including creating user journeys, wireframes and interactive prototypes</li><li>Create high fidelity user interaction and interface designs</li><li>Work closely with our engineering team to ensure implementation aligns with designs</li><li>Develop standards and a unified style guide for your designs, to ensure a consistent user experience and to make it easy for others to implement</li><li>Present and communicate your ideas and designs to others in the company</li><li>Contribute to overall brand and design strategy</li><li>Be involved in various kinds of usability testing (User testing, Beta testing, A/B etc.)</li><li>Interact with our customers, to understand how they use our products, their goals and pain points.</li></ul><div><h4>To do this job, you will need:</h4></div><ul><li>Proven experience as a UX / UI Designer — backed up by a strong portfolio</li><li>Experience in designing high quality experiences for both mobile and desktop</li><li>Experience in user journey mapping, wire-framing and interactive prototypes</li><li>High attention to detail and a passion for keeping designs simple and efficient</li><li>Well rounded design skills that range from early wire frames, through to high fidelity designs</li><li>Proficient with design tools, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Sketch, Adobe CC, InVision, Balsamic etc</li><li>Good knowledge of design trends and best practices across different devices and platforms</li></ul><div><h4>Other Requirements &amp; Competencies</h4></div><ul><li>Are clear on the value you’ll bring to the team.</li><li>Know how to follow instructions and how to be creative – and how to choose between them.</li><li>Speak and read/write perfect English.</li><li>Have a sense of humor.</li><li>Always work to develop a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>.</li><li>Good at self-managing.</li><li>A ‘Hands On’ attitude: You are naturally curious and want to understand how things work.

We create options for exploration and self-expression.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>And we work the way we practice.

We deliver products, solutions and platforms built using blockchain technology to transform how business is done in complex network of buyers, suppliers and consumers.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, the music industry, security, and infrastructure, and more. To accomplish this we've built out a flat organizational structure which we call the ConsenSys Mesh: a network of individuals &amp; teams working autonomously and towards the same goal.  Our mission is to use these decentralized solutions to fundamentally reshape the economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us.</p><p> <br>About the role:</p><p>As a Design Facilitator you will work collaboratively, creatively, and flexibly with interdisciplinary teams and with our clients. The Design Facilitation practice at ConsenSys is primarily driven by our desire to help our teams and customers use Design Thinking to achieve outstanding, human-centered results. The Design Thinking team at ConsenSys currently consists of two facilitators and is projected to grow to four by July 2018. Future growth will depend on demand for Design Thinking from the wider organisation.</p><p>What gets us excited:</p><p>-You have a proven history of using design thinking in a variety of ways and in a variety of locations and cultures, at lots of different places from big to small companies, and start-ups.<br>-A strong point of view - you aren’t just along for the ride. Lots of blog posts and videos and podcasts (for example) where we can learn about what you care about and how you express yourself.<br>-Background in teaching and making your own courses and curriculum.<br>-References who will say lots of nice things about you and help us understand how you would fit in at ConsenSys.<br>-A passion for exploring the possibilities of blockchain technology.</p><p>Responsibilities:</p><p>-Run workshops in all forms — a facilitator needs to have a comprehensive grasp of design thinking at a sophisticated level, including methods and mindsets. You need to be able to effectively guide a team of people through the design thinking framework in person and remotely. Please note that we are not looking for theoretical trainers - you must be experienced at delivering hands-on facilitation services.<br>-Advocate, inspire, reflect—we’re going to be building the airplane as we fly it. The facilitator also needs to be a content creator and think about how to better apply design thinking in the venture accelerator model.<br>-Client facing — for ConsenSys to succeed, we will need to interact with potential customers and users in order to understand their worlds, needs, and aspirations. The facilitator needs to be comfortable working with people outside the organization. Typical client sessions will be for consulting engagements and for helping teams co-create with their users.<br>-Teaching and modeling — helping teams get better at design thinking so they can apply it on their own in-between facilitator-led workshops.<br>-Stay on your feet—a facilitator is always actively adapting to the environment they’re shaping. You need to know when to be flexible, when to hold firm, and how to calmly navigate ever-changing waters.<br>-Staying organized—tracking who is asking for workshops, when you are running workshops, when you are traveling, finding supplies, planes, and hotels. Being an independent facilitator has a lot of moving pieces and you’ll most be on your own to handle your schedule.</p><p>Requirements:</p><p>-You understand human-centered design philosophy and love sharing design methodologies.<br>-You really care about how process turns innovative ideas into awesome realities.<br>-You love to learn. Blockchain, design thinking, and software development are all young enough disciplines that there is an endless amount to discover and invent.<br>-Test and learn is part of your DNA.<br>-You restlessly reinvent yourself and your facilitation practice.<br>-You question everything! You regularly ask yourself “Why does it have to be this way and how can it be better?”<br>-Self starter— you won’t have a manager in this role.  No one will tell you what you have to do, and you work better that way.<br> </p><p>Some perspectives on facilitation to check out:</p><p><a href='https://medium.com/design-ibm/build-experiences-not-features-9ae0d2c0117a' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/design-ibm/build-experiences-not-features-9ae0d2c0117a</a></p><p><a href='https://medium.com/design-ibm/prototyping-ibm-design-thinking-method-cards-1328080da382' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/design-ibm/prototyping-ibm-design-thinking-method-cards-1328080da382</a></p><p><a href='https://medium.com/design-ibm/facilitator-unconference-2017-with-design-at-business-d20696ab6354' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/design-ibm/facilitator-unconference-2017-with-design-at-business-d20696ab6354</a></p><p> </p><p>Application instructions:</p><p>Cover letters and resumes are not required.

It might sound like a dream, but all that glitters is not gold, and it might not be the right choice for you. In this article, I’ll share some insights from my four years of travel and work that hopefully will be useful for anyone willing to try a nomadic lifestyle, too.</p><p>When I wrote the first draft of this article, I was in London, after a long trip to Asia. Now, I’m making changes to it in Mexico, before going to Argentina to visit my family. Changing countries often has become an important part of my life as a designer; and, curiously, it all happened by accident.</p><p>I once heard that, while at the office, you should stand up from your desk, stretch your legs, leave the building and never come back. That’s exactly what I did when I was living in Barcelona in March 2014. At the time, I was working for a big company on a project that I didn’t enjoy, and was participating in meetings with people I didn’t know. Sounds like fun, doesn’t it?</p><p>Looking back, I see that quitting a stable job to jump into the void of a traveling life was one of the scariest moments of my life. I was going to start a trip to South America, doing design workshops and lectures that would provide me with income to sustain my journey — but in reality, I had no idea what I was doing. Without knowing it, I was becoming a nomadic designer.</p>    <div>      <div>    <p>Getting the process <em>just</em> right ain't an easy task.

Location: Barcelona.            <p>When that six-month trip ended and I went back to Barcelona, I was never able to settle again. So, what did I do? Of course, I kept traveling! Four years and 60 countries later, I’m still on it.</p><p>And I am not alone. I’d like to quote Vitaly Friedman (founder and long-time <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/rachel-andrew-editor-in-chief/' rel='nofollow'>editor in chief</a> of Smashing Magazine), who <a href='https://the-pastry-box-project.net/vitaly-friedman/2014-december-23' rel='nofollow'>once said</a>:</p><blockquote>“There is nothing more liberating and sentimental than the sound of a closing door that you will never open again. As memories are flowing by, you turn your back from that door, you hold your breath for just a second and you walk away. At that point you almost sense the change in the wind flowing by. You let go; and knowing and feeling this change is an incredibly empowering, intoxicating experience.”</blockquote><p>If this sounds appealing, and you would like to try it for yourself, I hope my article will help you get started. Please note, however, that I’m not going to give you a “how to” guide, with step-by-step instructions that will work for everyone. Instead, I’ll share some insights from my personal experience.</p><h4>Whatever People Think It Is, It Is Not That</h4><p>When I tell someone that I’m constantly traveling, usually the person looks amazed. Most of the time, their first question is, “How can you afford to live like that?” I sometimes joke, saying I’m a millionaire with plenty of free time, but it’s not only because of this that I suspect they get the wrong idea about “working and traveling.” Perhaps, some of them imagine plenty of beaches and a lot of comfort and freedom.</p><p>Well, guess what? Working from a beach is not that fun or convenient. Or, as <a href='http://millo.co/what-freelancing-is-not' rel='nofollow'>Preston Lee</a> puts it, “Freelancing is not sitting on the beach, sipping margaritas, and reading books by <a href='https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307465357/' rel='nofollow'>Tim Ferriss</a>.”</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/edae7afa-af01-4f84-ad9c-41d237b1a6c4/four-places-to-work.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        I've worked in all kind of places: public libraries, hostels, friends' houses (and, of course, some of them had cats). Can you spot a beach in any of these photos?            <p>But the part about having a lot of freedom is true. I do have a lot of freedom and flexibility — like any other freelancer — with the bonus that I get to know different places, people, cultures and cuisines. The perks of such a lifestyle outweigh the difficulties, but at the same time, not everyone would be willing to handle it.</p><p>Today, the “digital nomad” hype is <a href='https://www.fastcompany.com/3068312/the-digital-nomads-guide-to-working-from-anywhere-on-e' rel='nofollow'>all around</a>, with a lot of people publishing e-books, videos and blog posts selling an ideal lifestyle that’s apparently perfect. Of course, some things are often left out — things like getting tired of packing again and again, being away from family and friends, and starting over often. That’s why people might have a unrealistic idea of <a href='https://hackernoon.com/waking-up-in-thailand-c0cea601293a' rel='nofollow'>what all this is about</a>.</p><p>In case you are considering trying something similar, it might help to be aware of some personal characteristics that would be helpful to have.</p><h5>Comfort With Being Alone</h5><p>Being a solo traveler allows me to make my own decisions and be wherever I want, whenever I want. I spend a lot of time by myself (luckily, I get along well with myself). Even though it’s fine for me, I know it’s not for everybody. Loneliness is easy to solve, though. Coworking spaces, hostels, <a href='https://www.couchsurfing.com/mobile-hangouts' rel='nofollow'>couchsurfing hangouts</a> and <a href='https://www.meetup.com/' rel='nofollow'>Meetup</a> are great places when you feel like you need some company and want to meet new friends.</p><h5>Being Able To Adapt To New Contexts Easily</h5><p>On a rough average, I move from one place to another every four days. This is very tiring, because every time I switch cities, I have to repeat the same process: book transportation and accommodation, pack my stuff, figure out how to get around, check the weather and find out about the cost of living. Ideally, you won’t be moving that often, but you should be able to grab your things quickly and move to a new place that better meets your expectations.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/78ed19e4-1f8e-4ec7-ac90-9c0ddcd9d45c/02-the-nomadic-designer.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        In my travels, I've taken more flights than I would like to admit. That's a problem when moving so much from one place to another. Location: São Paulo, Brazil.            <p>In some cases, you could plan to stay three or four months in the same spot, but the reality is that you will never know how you’ll feel until you get there. So, my advice is: Go little by little, especially at the beginning.</p><h5>Flexible But Organized</h5><p>I think I’ve never been as organized as I’ve been since I started traveling. Apart from the tools that I normally use to generate invoices, track payments and manage projects as a freelance designer, I also have several spreadsheets to organize my flights, accommodation and daily expenses.</p><p>The spreadsheet for expenses is divided into different categories and organized by day. I put in there all the money that goes out, so that I know exactly what’s happening, and how close I am to reaching my daily budget. I know there are some apps for this, but so far I haven’t felt comfortable with any of them. The key here is not to cheat (just write down everything) and to be consistent (do it every day) — this will give you good insight into how you are spending your money on the road. Then, it will be easier for you to make decisions based on the data gathered — for example, you could stop buying expensive cocktails so much.</p><h4>Before Packing: Find A Remote-Friendly Job</h4><p>If you’ve decided to give it a try, then, as a minimum, plan your start, and don’t leave home without at least one or two months of contracted work. This will keep you busy for the first part of your trip, so you’ll only have to worry about settling in a new place.</p><p>When I went to South America at the very beginning of my new life, I contacted several design organizations, schools and agencies that could help me organize design workshops and lectures in different countries. I did this because, a few months before leaving, I, along with a friend (¡hola <a href='https://twitter.com/josevittone' rel='nofollow'>José</a>!) <a href='http://www.appdesignbook.com' rel='nofollow'>self-published a book</a> that gained some popularity among designers in Latin America, and I was willing to teach its contents and show how to put them into practice. Doing things like that provided me with at least some idea of dates and an approximate income, while leaving other things to improvisation.</p>  <div></div><p>In my case, I’ve always liked being a freelancer, so I give myself a bit more flexibility in managing my schedule. One of the last projects I worked on was for a team in Barcelona and in which the words “remote” and “freelance” were clear in our agreement from the very beginning. This is what allowed me to keep going from country to country, splitting my time between work and getting to know new places and people.</p><p>Just so you know how “glamorous” this way of working is, at the beginning of this project I tried to hide my background during video calls or said that I couldn’t turn video on, because I was a bit embarrassed. By the end, though, my teammates didn’t care about that, and so later on, usually the first question of a video call was to ask me for a tour of the place I was staying at, to everyone’s amusement.</p><p>Of course, freelancing is not the only way. Working at a remote-friendly company could also be a good option for you. While you’ll lose some of the freedom to move around, if you plan to stay longer in places, then this could be the way to go: <a href='https://www.hubspot.com/jobs/search' rel='nofollow'>Hubspot</a>, <a href='https://basecamp.com/about/jobs' rel='nofollow'>Basecamp</a>, <a href='https://www.sketchapp.com/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>Bohemian Coding</a> (of Sketch fame) and <a href='https://qz.com/694410/automattic-has-figured-out-the-right-tools-for-remote-working/' rel='nofollow'>Automattic</a> are some examples of companies that successfully work with designers and developers remotely, and there are many more.</p><p>A few websites list remote positions for design, so be sure to check them often: <a href='https://weworkremotely.com/categories/remote-design-jobs' rel='nofollow'>We Work Remotely</a>, <a href='https://remoteok.io/remote-design-jobs' rel='nofollow'>Remote OK</a>, <a href='https://www.workingnomads.co/jobs?category=design' rel='nofollow'>Working Nomads</a> and <a href='https://www.designernews.co/jobs?remote=yup' rel='nofollow'>Designer News</a> — to name just some of them.</p><p>Regardless of whether you are freelancing or working for someone else, I have to say that face to face contact with members of your team is necessary from time to time to time, especially when planning meetings at the beginning of a project, when things are not all that clear. This will partly determine the location you choose, so best to pick a place that allows you to conveniently go where your team is based when needed.</p><h4>Choosing Your Next Destination</h4><p>After finding work that allows you to be on the move, the next big thing is to decide where to base yourself. The good thing is that you can work from any place with a decent Internet connection and easy access to coffee (which is essential).</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4e3cdb50-6185-4b68-87fb-7156c498436b/01-the-nomadic-designer.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        I always say that, to work, I need only an Internet connection and a laptop. So, this place at almost 5,000 meters up is a good place to get stuff done. Location: somewhere near Uyuni, Bolivia.            <p>So far, I’ve been in 60 countries, more or less. Many of them were in Europe, where it is easy to move from one place to another and where you can sometimes cross countries without even noticing. (True story: I once missed a whole country because I fell asleep on the train.)</p><p>When choosing where to go next, keep in mind the following.</p><h5>Reliable Access To Internet</h5><p>You’ll never know how good the Internet connection is until you get there, but at least <a href='https://www.internetsociety.org/map/global-internet-report/#download-speed-fixed' rel='nofollow'>you can research which countries have the best and worst</a>. This is important. Even if you’re tempted to spend a few days in the middle of a forest, if there is no access to Internet, it will probably be a no-go.</p><h5>Time Zones</h5><p>Choose a place where you’ll be in the same time zone with the rest of your team, or maybe a couple of hours ahead or behind. You’ll thank me when you have to schedule your first online meeting and it’s not 4:00 am.</p><h5>Work Facilities</h5><p>I’ve said that I can work from almost anywhere, but I have to make sure that my next destination at least has some good coffee shops, libraries or coworking spaces. You could also work from your hostel, hotel or rented flat, but then you’d have to make sure it’s a proper environment to work in.</p><h5>Design Ecosystem</h5><p>It’s always good to be surrounded by like-minded people, so many times before going somewhere, I’ll check whether there’s a designer, a design studio or a meetup where I could visit and get in touch with others. Luckily, some people are always willing to meet new pals, and they’ll give you good insight into how the local design community works. You can exchange and share tools of the trade, and you can make new friends as well.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/84fc63ed-4c26-428b-ae24-fa0d4e88e11f/07-the-nomadic-designer.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        Sometimes I don't choose my destinations right… at least for getting some work done. Being in the middle of snowy places forced me to take unplanned vacations. Location: Mongolia.            <p>In my case, sending some emails in advance enabled me to meet such talented people as <a href='https://twitter.com/flarup' rel='nofollow'>Michael Flarup</a> in Copenhagen and <a href='https://twitter.com/SachaGreif' rel='nofollow'>Sacha Greif</a> in Osaka. Just don’t be afraid to ask if you can drop by for a short visit!</p><p>Besides that, other factors are at play when you’re deciding where to go: affordability, transportation, safety, weather, etc. Fortunately, Nomad List rounds up the <a href='https://nomadlist.com/' rel='nofollow'>“best” cities,</a>, which you can use as a reference when choosing where to head to next.</p><p>Of course, sooner or later, you’ll make some mistake. I’ve learned the hard way that <strong>planning where to work is indeed important</strong>. I once had to take a few unintended days off <a href='https://medium.com/nomad-designers/travelling-in-the-trans-siberian-from-st-petersburg-to-beijing-afcc596e0022' rel='nofollow'>when I took the Trans-Siberian train to go from St. Petersburg to Beijing via Mongolia</a>. At some point, the temperatures in the middle of Siberia were so low — the worst day was -50º Celsius — that my phones’ batteries suddenly drained — and being lost in the middle of a snowy small town is anything but fun. (The Russians there thought I was crazy for traveling during winter, and I now know they were right. But if you are like me and go there during wintertime anyway, always keep a paper copy of directions and important information, and bring warm boots and a pocket-sized bottle of vodka.)</p><h4>Packing And Gear</h4><p>If you already have a job and know where you are heading to, then you are ready to pack! Someone once said that before starting a trip, you should take half the things you plan to carry and double the money you have budgeted. While the last thing is not always an option, <strong>packing light</strong> is doable! You’ll thank me when you find your accommodation is uphill.</p><p>I started traveling with a 50-liter backpack for my personal things, and a smaller one for work-related items that I carry separately. After some time, I switched the smaller one for a daypack that I can roll up and put into the big one when I don’t need it. Everything (including the laptop) weighs 10 kilograms or so, but I keep assessing what else can I take off in order to have fewer things to carry. Similarly to when working on a design, try to <a href='https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/antoine_de_saintexupery_103610' rel='nofollow'>get rid of the unnecessary</a>.</p><p>For my work, I chose a MacBook Air because I knew I was going to travel a lot, and I wanted something lightweight and compact. Even though it’s a bit old now, it’s been enough for my requirements so far. I also carry two phones (iPhone and Android, with their corresponding chargers) because I do a lot of UX design for mobile and I often need to test on different devices.</p><p>I do have more gadgets and stuff, of course. I carry a remote to control my slides (for conferences and workshops), all kinds of adaptors, and noise-cancelling headphones (very useful for when you travel by train or plane.) But, in general, it is a good idea not to over-buy in advance, and pick up items only when you need them.</p><h4>Where To Work</h4><p>I have worked in all kinds of places: buses, trains, coffee shops, airport lounges, libraries, shared rooms in hostels, private rooms in hotels — sometimes anywhere I can set my laptop horizontally… or kind of. I’ve even gotten used to not using a mouse at all, because there is not always a place to put it next to my laptop.</p><p>Chances are the room where you stay is also going to be where you will work, so choose carefully. <a href='http://www.airbnb.com' rel='nofollow'>Airbnb</a> is now pretty much widespread, so renting your own room with a desk should be enough — but be sure to mark “laptop friendly” in the search filters.</p><p>I try to keep a low budget, so most of the time I stay in a hostel. After a bit of training, I’ve learned to identify places that look better for work — like ones with spacious common areas — just by looking at the pictures. Of course, “party hostels” are not an option if you want to get work done, so if you see a lot of people having fun on the property’s website, that’s a red flag.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/25d055e2-eb65-4d9f-8a77-74346a1b31f4/04-the-nomadic-designer.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        I sleep in shared dorms in hostels most of the time, to keep my budget low and meet new people, but there's not much privacy. Location: Sofia, Bulgaria.            <p>One of the main problems is that you never know how good the Internet connection will be. So, if you have difficulty with the Wi-Fi at your hostel, go to a coffee shop, coworking space or even a public library. (Interestingly, public libraries are where I’m most productive, perhaps because of the silence and the fact that I cannot make calls or participate in online meetings.)</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> More than once, I’ve visited a coworking space and offered to give a free design lecture to members in exchange of a few days’ worth of using a desk. It’s also nice because afterwards people will know who you are and will approach you openly to share ideas! Feel free to try it yourself.</p><p>Finally, a couple of websites could be useful when you’re looking for a place to work — namely, <a href='https://workfrom.co/' rel='nofollow'>Workfrom</a> and <a href='https://placestowork.net/' rel='nofollow'>Places to Work</a>.</p><h4>Things To Keep In Mind When Living On The Road</h4><p>A few things are important for any traveling designer but are too complex to address completely in one article, so I’ll just briefly mention a few of them, in the hope that it will still be useful.</p><p>Please keep in mind that everybody’s situation is different. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, so you might have to adapt the following to your case.</p><h5>Taxes</h5><p>What is convenient for you will depend on your case, and it’s difficult to advise on what’s best, so be aware of the legislation of your home country and of the country where you plan to work. I’ve also been exploring the possibilities <a href='https://e-estonia.com/solutions/business-and-finance/' rel='nofollow'>that Estonia is offering with its e-citizenship</a>. I’m already an Estonian e-resident, but I haven’t done anything practical with this as of yet.</p><h5>Managing Your Finances</h5><p>Besides keeping spreadsheets for expenses, one thing that I discovered (perhaps too late) is that it is normally far more convenient to create an account in an app such as <a href='https://monzo.com/' rel='nofollow'>Monzo</a> or <a href='https://www.revolut.com/' rel='nofollow'>Revolut</a> (and there are plenty of others, like <a href='https://next.n26.com/en-eu/' rel='nofollow'>N26</a>), so that, when making withdrawals, you pay fewer fees and get better exchange rates. This is especially useful in places where credit or debit cards are not normal; this way, you can also avoid the excessive fees that traditional banks often charge.</p><p>Also, check the exchange rate of your home currency before arriving at your next destination. In some cases, I’ve arrived in a new country and bought a very expensive coffee because I didn’t do my homework beforehand. One app I use to avoid situations like this is <a href='http://currency.nunocoelhosantos.com/' rel='nofollow'>Currency</a>, an elegant and simple currency converter.</p><h5>Visas</h5><p>The situation will depend on where you’re from and where you’re going, so <a href='https://www.travisa.com/Visa_Search.aspx' rel='nofollow'>check well</a> <a href='https://www.travisa.com/Visa_Search.aspx' rel='nofollow'>in advance</a> regarding the requirements <a href='https://www.passportindex.org/byIndividualRank.php' rel='nofollow'>for the passport you are holding</a>.</p><p>Something useful I learned when applying for a visa that requires a tentative itinerary is to book hostels and planes that you can later on cancel for free, and print out and bring those booking confirmations.</p><h5>Health And Insurance</h5><p>Plenty of companies offer health insurance for travel, so I cannot recommend any one of them. The only thing I can advise is not to leave home without it. An accident in a foreign country, besides being annoying, could also be very expensive. So, prepare in advance.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4e45f879-d7cc-4427-a93d-1d01690b094b/03-the-nomadic-designer.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        You never know where you'll be when there's a problem at work, so try to find ways to stay connected on the go. Location: somewhere near Jericoacoara, Brazil.            <h5>Getting Connected</h5><p>What I normally do is buy a prepaid SIM card in each country I stay, with a data plan that will be enough for my stay there. I do a bit of research beforehand to see which carrier has the most widespread coverage, and I check if there’s any information in English on their website to make recharges when necessary.</p><p>A SIM card is more necessary in some countries than in others. For example, in Russia, most open Wi-Fi networks require you to fill in a phone number, to which a validation code will be sent, before you are able to use the network. Japan, on the other hand, is full of convenience stores with free internet (such as 7-Eleven), so a SIM card is not so necessary. Meanwhile, <a href='https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/telecoms-internet/mobile-roaming-costs/index_en.htm' rel='nofollow'> Europe now has a more convenient way to handling roaming, called “Roam like at home”,</a> and getting a new SIM card in every country is not so necessary anymore.</p><p>In any case, before buying a SIM card, make sure it will work across the country, especially if the country is large with many different regions.Another important thing to check beforehand: Will your current phone number work in the new country? Luckily, <a href='https://willmyphonework.net/' rel='nofollow'>there’s a website where you can check that information</a>.</p><h5>Preparing To Be Offline</h5><p>Moving from one place to another involves a lot of time spent on the road, and in some cases you won’t have the chance to find Wi-Fi or good data network coverage. At these times, <a href='https://www.spotify.com' rel='nofollow'>Spotify</a> and <a href='https://www.netflix.com' rel='nofollow'>Netflix</a> are my best friends, because both allow me to download music and TV shows, respectively, so I can use them without an Internet connection. This was especially useful when I had to take several connecting trains to cross Siberia, spending in some cases around 30 hours straight in a railroad car before my next stop.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bee03aac-4346-4762-ae76-42e4d3a2fffa/05-the-nomadic-designer.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        I still had an Internet connection in these mountains in Bulgaria! However, being offline from time to time and enjoying the natural surroundings is really advisable. Location: Seven Rila Lakes region, Bulgaria.            <p>For the same reason, I always download a map of my next destination, <a href='https://support.google.com/maps/answer/6291838?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en' rel='nofollow'>using Google Maps</a> (<a href='https://maps.me/download/' rel='nofollow'>Maps.me</a> has the same functionality).</p><p>If you want more information of this kind, check out <a href='https://medium.com/nomad-designers/advices-and-travel-hacks-from-4-years-of-travelling-e082b3ade981' rel='nofollow'>another article I wrote</a>, with more travel hacks and tips from my years of traveling.</p><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><p>Before I board my next train, let me tell you that becoming a nomadic freelance designer is by far one of my best decisions of my life so far. I have the flexibility that any freelancer has, but I also meet new people and see new places all the time. And it’s not as expensive as you might think. If you control your budget, traveling could be cheaper than living in a big city. So, I can afford to work four to five hours every day, and I use the rest of the time to get to know the place I’m visiting, to work on personal projects and to <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/javiercuello/' rel='nofollow'>write articles for Smashing Magazine</a>.</p><p>Traveling also makes it a bit hard to separate pleasure from work, because everything seems more enjoyable when you’re moving around. I’ve had to remind myself sometimes that I’m not on a vacation and to focus on getting things done. After a while, though, I’ve found a good balance. Now, I allow myself some moments to just move around, travel and enjoy the ride, doing nothing. It’s not all about work, after all!</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4385814c-6f81-49cf-84a5-eedd6caf5560/06-the-nomadic-designer.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        Taking a train in Siberia. It's not all about work. You also have to let yourself go and enjoy your ride. Location: somewhere in Russia.            <p>Living like this is sometimes challenging and tiring, but I find it much richer than being in an office Monday to Friday, 9:00 to 5:00. And with all of the current technology, it’s easy for any designer to embrace this lifestyle. The most difficult part is finding a job to sustain your travel, but once you’ve found it, the next part is just to let it flow.</p><p>The nomadic lifestyle is not right for everyone, but the only way to know for sure is to try. Neale Donald Walsch once said that <a href='https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10646-life-begins-at-the-end-of-your-comfort-zone' rel='nofollow'>life starts where your comfort zone ends</a>, and I completely agree.

    "content": "<p>What if you could work in an environment that offered:</p><ul><li>Great company</li><li>Important and Noble Mission – Meaningfully contribute to Saving the Planet</li><li>Valuable Work and a Great Team that Really Values Your Contributions</li><li>Unusually Nice People that are really passionate about their mission</li><li>Flexible hours and freedom to mold work to your schedule</li></ul><p>If that sounds too good to be true, read on to learn about a Silicon Valley company with a fantastic culture that is already having an impact on reducing climate change with the potential to meaningfully contribute to solving one of the most important challenges of our generation.</p><p>Smart Wires is looking to hire two valuable remote employees that can help our team achieve a much higher impact every day.&nbsp;&nbsp; We call these employees “Project Coordinators”, but it is tricky to describe the role and their impact in just a couple words.</p><p>We have two of these incredibly valuable Project Coordinators today, and our goal is to double the team immediately. Our Project Coordinators have shared that one of the things they like most about their jobs is that they get to learn every day from some of the most progressive management leaders in the entire tech industry and help transform a power grid that should no longer be running on carbon based fuels. Supporting a variety of work streams, you will be in a unique position at a company that is revolutionizing the energy industry with a culture that 99% of the world only dreams about.</p><p><br><strong>The Company:</strong><br>Smart Wires (www.smartwires.com) has developed an innovative technology that dramatically improves the efficiency of today’s power grid. Driven by a world-class leadership team, Smart Wires works with utilities globally to address the unique challenges of the rapidly evolving electric system. We deploy our revolutionary technologies to “re-route power” around overloaded lines and address the most serious problems challenging our transmission system.&nbsp; Our solutions offer a superior value proposition to all other solutions that a utility will consider and represent a complete paradigm shift for utilities that are finding it very difficult to build new lines in a world with so much uncertainty around the future needs of the grid.&nbsp; These utilities recognize that their grids are running with concerning levels of inefficiency today and are under immense pressure to “get more out of their existing grids”, which is why Smart Wires has accumulated a true “Who’s Who” list of customers and forced the entire industry to take notice of this revolutionary technology solution.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Culture: </strong><br>We are carefully engineering our culture to attract stunning performers who thrive in a “Freedom and Responsibility” environment. Borrowing heavily from the cultural breakthroughs offered by Netflix, this culture rejects tight management of detailed tasks, focusing instead on hiring great people capable of managing important missions with fairly limited direction and supervision.&nbsp; We give even those with limited work experience the resources they need and believe that certain “superstars” are hard-wired to deliver nothing but truly excellent results.&nbsp; This is an atmosphere of rapid professional development and incredible learning.&nbsp; Our goal is to place superstars in every role so that we rely and trust each other to do our jobs brilliantly, knowing that this strategy ensures a fun, exciting workplace and nearly guarantees continued commercial success.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Position:</strong><br>We are looking to add two more virtual Project Coordinators to our team.&nbsp; Our current thinking is that one of these will be a dedicated full time resource working 30 – 40 hours per week. The other may work on part time basis with the potential to migrate to full time status based on how much they enjoy working with the company and whether we have enough volume of work that fits well with this person’s key skill set.</p><p>These roles will be personally responsible for managing many of our team’s most important tasks, coordinating with people at all levels of the organization to allow for better utilization of the entire team. The dynamic candidate we seek will be sharp, strategic, organized, detail-oriented, flexible, creative, serious (but still able to laugh at themselves…), committed, and passionate about their work.</p><p>The ideal candidate possesses superior communication skills, is a strong team player who enjoys working with all levels of staff, and is prepared to roll their sleeves up and dig in on a new task every day.&nbsp; Some of the tasks you are likely to tackle in your first six months include:</p><ul><li>Performing research on a variety of topics from customer bios and market trends to office equipment evaluations</li><li>Creating, collating, and presenting valuable insights in MS PowerPoint and Excel&nbsp;</li><li>Organizing and preparing necessary materials for stakeholder meetings</li><li>Scheduling and coordinating meetings and appointments for a variety of projects</li><li>Providing administrative support as needed</li><li>Ensuring projects adhere to designed frameworks and that we have proper documentation on the most critical elements of each key project</li></ul><p>Smart Wires is looking for the Project Coordinator to become another indispensable and highly recognized company superstar. If you can do all of the aforementioned things, this one should be straightforward. We want someone who will master these and other tasks in just a few months and then we want them asking, “What else can I do to contribute?”&nbsp; And that’s when the real fun begins…</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Ideal Candidate:</strong></p><ul><li>Is an excellent communicator with fantastic interpersonal skills</li><li>Can effectively conduct online research and produce quality / professional work with limited supervision</li><li>Has the ability to work efficiently and comfortably on multiple projects / tasks concurrently</li><li>Can work effectively with a variety of different people at all levels</li><li>Has the ability to problem solve independently and synthesize information from various sources</li><li>Has reasonably strong fluency with Microsoft office, specifically PowerPoint and Outlook</li><li>Appreciates the value of learning from unusually bright and passionate coworkers and supervisors that are committed to rapid professional development</li></ul>",

This article explains how unethical design happens, and how to do ethical design through a set of best practices. It also helps you understand how you can plant the seed to change the meaning within the company you work for and in the design community, even if you are not part of the management layer. Change starts with a movement!</p><h4>Ethical Design</h4><p>Let’s start with the core terminology: According to <a href='https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ethic' rel='nofollow'>Merriam Webster</a>, ethics is “the discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation.” For the purpose of this article, ethics will be defined as a system of moral principles that defines what is perceived as good and evil. Ethical design is, therefore, design made with the intent to do good, and unethical design is its black hat counterpart.</p>      <div>      <div>        <p>          Is your pattern library up to date today? <em>Alla Kholmatova</em> has just finished a fully fledged book on <strong>Design Systems</strong> and how to get them right. With common traps, gotchas and the lessons she learned.

It is founded by Aral Balkan and Laura Kalbag who defined an “<a href='https://ind.ie/ethical-design/' rel='nofollow'>Ethical Hierarchy of Needs</a>” that describe the core of ethical design very well.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4bb28749-d346-4d08-8e81-17ede0c2a4df/ethical-design-hierarcy.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        The 'Ethical Hierarchy of Needs' (licensed under <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/' rel='nofollow'>CC BY 4.0</a>) (Source: <a href='https://ind.ie/' rel='nofollow'>ind.ie</a>)            <p>As with any pyramid-shaped structure, the layers in the <em>Ethical Hierarchy of Needs</em> rest on the layer below it. If any layer is broken, the layers resting on top of it will collapse. If a design does not support human rights, it is unethical. If it supports human rights but does not respect human effort by being functional, convenient and reliable (and usable!), then it is <em>unethical</em>. If it respects human effort but does not respect human experience by making a better life for the people using it, then it is still <em>unethical</em>.</p><p>From a practical viewpoint, this means that products and services which exploit user data, use dark patterns and generally are only out to make money, disregarding its human purpose, are unethical. Let’s look at how unethical design manifests itself in business models and design decisions.</p><h4>Unethical Design: The Black Hat Of The Business </h4><h5>Surveillance Capitalism</h5><p>Data-driven design can be used to do good. But more often than not it is used with monetary intent also known as surveillance capitalism.</p><p>As <a href='https://twitter.com/aral' rel='nofollow'>Aral Balkan</a>, ethical designer and founder of <a href='https://ind.ie/' rel='nofollow'>ind.ie</a> puts it:</p><blockquote>“When a company like Facebook improves the experience of its products, it’s like the massages we give to Kobe beef: they’re not for the benefit of the cow but to make the cow a better product. In this analogy, you are the cow.”</blockquote><p>Surveillance capitalism is unethical by nature because at its core, it takes advantage of rich data to profile people and understand their behavior with the sole purpose of making money. The most chilling thought of all is how data is being used not just to predict and manipulate current behavior, but how it is used to profile our future selves through machine learning, ultimately giving companies the power to impact our future decisions and behavioral patterns.</p><p>As Cracked Labs, independent research institute and creative laboratory, states in their report about <a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en/data-against-people' rel='nofollow'>Data Against People</a>:</p><blockquote>“Systems that make <strong>decisions about people</strong> based on their data produce substantial adverse effects that can massively limit their choices, opportunities, and life-chances”.</blockquote><p>This happens on a daily basis to everyone who use Facebook, where the individualized feed is carefully filtered to show the posts most likely to trigger engagement and activity. Pricing is also becoming increasingly individualized because companies are able to use rich data to assess the long-term value of customers, also known as <a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en/corporate-surveillance/info' rel='nofollow'>data-driven persuasion</a>.</p><p>Data trade and data tracking is big business. According to the report “<a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en/corporate-surveillance/#3' rel='nofollow'>Corporate Surveillance in Everyday Life</a>”, Oracle provides access to 5 billion (yes, billion!) unique user ID’s (this is confirmed on <a href='https://www.oracle.com/webfolder/s/dataexplorer/data-providers.html' rel='nofollow'>Oracle’s website</a>). The word “scared” does not cover the emotional state which we should all be in over that fact.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/170938ae-3f05-4571-bff3-67841f2751e1/ethical-design-data-trade.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        An overview of the amount of profiles held by online platforms, credit reporting agencies and consumer data brokers as of June 2017. (Source: <a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en/corporate-surveillance/#3' rel='nofollow'>Corporate Surveillance in Everyday Life</a>, <a href='https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/' rel='nofollow'>CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, <a href='http://crackedlabs.org/en' rel='nofollow'>Cracked Labs</a>)            <p>One can only imagine how companies will be able to utilize data to profile which of us are more likely to develop mental health or physical issues, thus putting us in the “no thanks” pile of applications for our future jobs. With this in mind, I fear for the future of my children.</p><p>To some the above sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, but it is not far-fetched at all. Unethical companies are exposed daily, from the <a href='https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/facebook-know-smartphones-activity-what-do-not-use-social-network-account-media-privacy-security-a7892761.html' rel='nofollow'>VPN app</a> who claimed to protect the data of their 24 million users, but sold it to Facebook to the software called <a href='http://alphonso.tv/' rel='nofollow'>Alphonso</a> which, according to an <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/business/media/alphonso-app-tracking.html' rel='nofollow'>article in The New York Times</a>, is used in more than 250 game apps (some of which are designed for children) to monitor what tv ads people watch, even if the app is not in active use. The list of companies who harvest and use data with deeply unethical purposes goes on and on and on.</p><h5>Black Hat Design</h5><p>Nevertheless, data tracking is not the only way that unethical design plays out. <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/' rel='nofollow'>Dark patterns</a> fall under unethical design too, as they are black hat design patterns specifically designed to trick us into doing something we don’t necessarily want to do. It may not be considered unethical when a company makes use of the dark pattern called <em>Roach Motel</em> to make it nearly impossible to delete your account (looking at you, Skype). But looking at the motivation of the business side, it is not hard to see the unethical nature of the design, naming the <a href='https://medium.com/shanghaiist/chinese-shoe-company-tricks-people-into-swiping-instagram-ad-with-fake-strand-of-hair-54d8a2d8ec1d' rel='nofollow'>Chinese shoe company</a> who tricked people to swipe by adding a fake strand of hair on their Instagram ad as just one example.</p>  <div></div><p>Harry Brignull, one of the originators and driving forces behind <a href='https://darkpatterns.org/' rel='nofollow'>Dark Patterns</a>, states that dark patterns work because they take advantage of the human brain’s weaknesses and the way we are hard-wired. That counts as unethical in my book, and we have a moral obligation to the people who design these products to do <em>better</em>.</p><p>Businesses who nurture consumerism and manipulate people into buying more stuff are unethical by design. It is common practice in e-commerce, and it takes advantage of a phenomenon called “<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion' rel='nofollow'>loss aversion</a>”. <a href='https://www.hotels.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hotels.com</a> is particularly aggressive, sending several notifications within seconds about how many people have booked and are looking at the same room as you.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a69293cb-38d9-4c21-a639-30b38659ae4a/ethical-design-hotels.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://de.hotels.com/' rel='nofollow'>Hotels.com</a> loves letting us know just how many others are looking at a room to 'motivate' us into booking fast.            <h4>The General Data Protection Regulation</h4><p>The effectuation of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation' rel='nofollow'>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> in late May 2018 will be an efficient tool in the fight against companies that are unethical by design.</p><p>GDPR is an extensive regulation that amongst the highlights include:</p><ul><li>The requirement of any organization that collects data to do so in a secure manner by design;</li><li>Heavy fines for data breaches;</li><li>Data must only be collected after explicit consent, and the language used to explain why the data is collected must be plain and simple. In addition, consent must be withdrawable at any time and must be as easy to do as it was giving it (which, by the way, includes <code>Sign up</code> → <code>Delete profile</code>);</li><li>“The right to be forgotten,” meaning that people have the right to have their data deleted;</li><li>The right for people to get access to their personal data in any organization, alongside information about how this data is processed;</li><li>Data portability, meaning that people have the right to get hold of their data in one company and transfer it to another company;</li><li>Heavy fines for non-compliance of GDPR.</li></ul><p>All in all, May 25, 2018, is a pretty good day for the people, and a sign of a much different future for all the unethically designed organizations out there.</p><p>But let’s not kid ourselves and think that change will happen overnight or across all organizations in a heartbeat. A deeper change is needed in order to make that happen over time.</p><h4>Change Happens Through Change Of Meaning</h4><p>GDPR is not likely to solve all of our problems. Believing that would be naive. That’s why it will continue to be up to the people within company walls to make a difference. The good news is that making a change is possible even if you’re not part of the management team who decides on the business model.</p><p>This type of change towards a more ethical design approach is not claimed to happen overnight. Rather, it is possible to make changes incrementally and foster long-term, organizational change through what Don Norman and Roberto Verganti call Meaning-driven Innovation (read more in their article about “<a href='http://www.jnd.org/dn.mss/Norman%20&amp;%20Verganti.%20Design%20Research%20&amp;%20Innovation-18%20Mar%202012.pdf' rel='nofollow'>Incremental and Radical Innovation</a>”).</p><p>Meaning-driven innovation is a result of people starting to articulate new thoughts that create new dynamics, which ultimately lead to radically new meanings.</p><p>Don Norman and Roberto Verganti say that radical innovation only happens when one of the following things occur:</p><ol><li>A new enabling technology is available in a reliable, economical form (it took 20 years for touch interfaces to exit the labs and enter the phone and tablet market);</li><li>When the meaning of something changes in society — also referred to as meaning-driven innovation.</li></ol><p>I think that the increasing awareness, focus, and concern about our privacy in respect to data-driven businesses will in a not so distinct future spark radical innovation and change in society. Ironically, the companies who founded surveillance capitalism have also sparked a change in how we perceive our right to privacy, and we are already starting to see companies and organizations innovate and foster privacy driven solutions.</p><p>The meaning of companies who track and surveil us is already changing. We used to not think very hard about, and maybe even find it convenient when ads served on Facebook were based on our browsing history. But with the escalation of surveillance capitalism, I will argue that we are going through a meaning change as an increasing mass of people are finding it not only uncomfortable but directly unacceptable to be spied on in the name of a business.</p><p><a href='https://duckduckgo.com/' rel='nofollow'>DuckDuckGo</a>, a search engine that doesn’t track, had an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo#Traffic' rel='nofollow'>average of 16 million search queries per day in 2017</a>, a sign that privacy is an increasing concern among people when using the web. Also, we are seeing apps devoted to privacy reaching markets, such as <a href='https://signal.org/' rel='nofollow'>Signal</a>, a secure phone and messenger app designed to protect privacy. Furthermore, it is highly likely that GDPR will spark further meaning change related to privacy.</p><h4>Transition To A Human-Centered Design Approach</h4><p>Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a philosophy developed by Don Norman (among others). According to the <a href='https://uxpa.org/' rel='nofollow'>User Experience Professionals Association</a> (UXPA), HCD is defined by “the active involvement of users and a clear understanding of user and task requirements”.</p><p>Don Norman and Roberto Verganti conclude in their substantial study that HCD is only suitable for incremental innovation — step by step improvements — because new ideas are not discovered while constantly looking at the existing state of things as it is done through user research.</p><p>While this sounds reasonable, I believe that HCD can prove to be the offset to meaning-driven innovation, ultimately leading to a broad meaning change about what people will accept and won’t accept from unethical organizations. The reason why I believe this, is that HCD fosters a deeper sense of empathy than any other experience design method.</p><p>Human-Centered Design is a framework as well as a mindset. At its core, working “human-centered” means involving the people you serve early and continuously in the process, i.e. using research to establish the needs of these people, understanding what problems they have, and how your product can help solve these problems.</p><p>It falls within the natural sphere of experience designers to work human-centered, but what do you do if your job is in design and development, and you are constantly occupied by sprint reviews and daily tasks?</p><p>While working with a remote development team, I learned that the developers didn’t have any contact with the people who used the product. This often led to heated discussions where statements like “I think…”, “From a technical perspective…”, and “I feel…” were the main arguments.</p><p>The biggest problem with basing decisions on what you think and feel, or what is easiest from a technical perspective, is that it doesn’t involve the people you are serving. The people who your product or service is put in the world to solve problems for. That’s where HCD comes in.</p><p>UX designers and researchers typically conduct research, document the insights and bring them forward in a refined state to the design- and product team in the shape of personas, user needs descriptions, user flows, journeys, and so on. And that’s all well and good. The problem is, however, that the distance between the organisation and people you serve remains large, because no one except the UX designers talked to them or have seen them use the product. So they keep going back to “I feel…”, “I think…” and “From a technical perspective…”</p><p>To help establish empathy towards the people you serve, there are a couple of very impactful things designers and developers — and the rest of the organization — can do (and can ask for from the UX team).</p><ol>    <li><strong>Involve all team members in watching videos from user testing sessions.</strong><br>Actually going through the pains and delights of the people who use your products (or prototypes, depending on what you’re testing) is worth every second. It cannot be stressed enough how important it is to watch other people interact with and comment on the stuff you’re building (and no, your team doesn't count as “people” here!).<br><br>If this is not part of the routine in your company, ask for it to be included. Certainly, the vast majority of UX designers who would not be thrilled to organize and facilitate such sessions. You are guaranteed to go through pain, agony, frustration, happiness and get multiple eye openers, and it will all serve as the stepping stone towards growing a human-centered mindset.</li>    <li><strong>Ask for actual, living portraits of the people you serve.</strong><br>This includes photos and video from contextual studies (link), stories from their daily life and stories about them. Getting a deeper sense of the people on the other side of the product you develop creates instant empathy and makes it a lot harder to design things that knowingly are bad for them.</li>    <li><strong>Insist on continuous testing.</strong><br>It cannot be emphasized enough how crucial testing is in HCD. This includes early proof of concept tests, prototype tests, and usability tests. A side bonus of early and continuous involvement from the people who are meant to use the product is that it saves money in the long run. The earlier you realize a bad call or error, the cheaper it is to fix.<br><br>A lot has been said about the nuclear alarm that was triggered by mistake in Hawaii on January 13. However, it’s pretty safe to say that early and continuous testing would have helped prevent it.<br>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/f1258cce-f17d-41e4-9374-6f087a651794/ethical-design-hawaii.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        A poorly designed screen has been named the cause of a false ballistic missile alert in Hawaii. (Source: <a href='https://twitter.com/civilbeat/status/953127542050795520' rel='nofollow'>Honolulu Civil Beat</a>)            </li><li><strong>Always ask “why?”</strong><br>To start a change of meaning in an organization or community, the first important step is to start asking “why.” Ask why something is being done unethically; ask why you are told to make a black hat feature; question the current state of things.<br><br>Ask on what grounds design decisions are being made. If it’s because of what the CEO or someone else thinks, and it has no root in insights from the people you are serving, ask for that validation. Meaning change grows through small steps.</li></ol><h4>Ethical Design Best Practices</h4><p>Alongside establishing a human-centered design tradition in the organization, it is also important to make use of the best practices of ethical design. People who do so are part of taking the lead and showing the rest of the organization how things can be done in a more ethical way, all of which will add to the incremental meaning change. Just as dark patterns fall under unethical design, we have White Hat design patterns that can be utilized to ensure ethical design, some of which you can learn about in the following.</p><h5>Use Data To Improve The Human Experience</h5><p>Despite numerous companies using data for unethical purposes, such as increasing consumption and traffic, data can, in fact, be used to actually improve the human experience.</p><p>This is the case on the <a href='https://ind.ie/' rel='nofollow'>ind.ie</a> forum where setting up an account is suggested as a way to customize your experience by remembering what you’ve read.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/2e353509-58d4-4e0b-b759-842d1361aac6/ethical-design-indie.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://ind.ie/' rel='nofollow'>ind.ie</a>'s forum highlights the benefits of setting up an account — one that won’t harvest your data and use it unethically.            <p>In a current project in which I am involved in making an app for students to more easily access their Learning Management System, we are sorting the student’s individual courses by “last visited”; we know through research that the students most often revisit a small number of pages that relate to the courses they are currently enrolled in. This customization is not designed to change behavior or nudge them into using parts of the app they didn’t intend to. Instead, it is designed to make their experience faster and more efficient.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/46eefbc4-bd90-49f3-ab1b-23d6aeeae473/ethical-design-student-app.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        In this early wireframe from a current project, it it shown how we used knowledge about current usage of the product to increase efficiency in the app by sorting the student’s courses by 'last visited'.            <p>Another positive example is the American pharmacy <a href='https://www.walgreens.com/' rel='nofollow'>Walgreens</a>, who sends out reminders when it’s time to refill on things like vitamins. This is an extremely helpful feature that solves a problem a lot of us have.</p><p>Data can help inform research initiatives to understand how you’re not tackling the problems people have when interacting with your product.</p><p><a href='https://www.skyscanner.net/' rel='nofollow'>Skyscanner</a>, a travel search engine, noticed through their data that their newly launched design didn’t go down well for the people who used their service to fly out of Amsterdam. That data helped inform a research initiative that ultimately lead to a customized solution for people flying to and from Amsterdam that broke down the barriers the new design had initially built (here’s the <a href='https://hackernoon.com/look-at-your-product-from-a-new-perspective-f0709760614b' rel='nofollow'>background story</a>).</p><h5>Advertising Without Tracking</h5><p>Advertising is not necessarily unethical. Advertising based on granular data is. It is careless (if not stupid) to rely on a single platform for the majority of a brand’s marketing efforts, especially considering that said platform owns and controls the data the brand uses as the foundation for its ad targeting.</p><p>Facebook, Instagram, and Google care just about as little about their advertisers as they do about the people who they see as “users,” i.e. they can make any change they want to, disregarding any consequences it might have for people or businesses using their platform. For example, there was a time when they started blocking fake accounts en masse, which hurt numerous companies whose social media admins had set up fake accounts to administer business pages because they (understandably) didn’t want to use their private accounts for this purpose. This is standard procedure from Facebook who <a href='https://www.facebook.com/terms' rel='nofollow'>only allows one profile per person</a> (likely because allowing several would contaminate their data tracking).</p><p>The platform is always the weakest link in a marketing strategy because it is a third party beyond the control of companies. Thinking back to the 90’s when I worked in marketing at a regional newspaper, granular data tracking was not an option. When a store had placed an ad in the paper about an event, they would simply monitor how many people showed up, and compare that to their expectations to determine the success rate.</p><p>While “the good old days” were certainly not good in all aspects, the thought of not basing advertising on granular user data tracking is an appealing thought. John Gruber’s blog, <a href='https://daringfireball.net' rel='nofollow'>Daring Fireball</a> is an example of a site that doesn’t allow ad tracking. Instead, John Gruber encourages advertisers to add a custom link to their ads enabling them to monitor the click rate on their end.</p><p>As John Gruber rightfully states:</p><blockquote>“If you pay (say) Facebook for an ad, why in the world would you, the advertiser, trust Facebook’s numbers for how the ad performed?”<br><br>— <a href='https://daringfireball.net/2017/07/df_display_ads' rel='nofollow'>Source</a></blockquote><p>Another great example worth highlighting is <a href='https://www.goodwings.com/en-us' rel='nofollow'>Goodwings</a>, a hotel booking site that donates half of their commission to charity. They can do so because of a close collaboration with a large number of NGO’s which means they spend very little on traditional marketing.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/fb1a5ade-edf2-4257-835d-1d10f93fb624/ethical-design-goodwings.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://www.goodwings.com/en-us' rel='nofollow'>Goodwings</a> is a hotel search engine that donates half of their commission to charity.            <p>And if you think Google Analytics is your only option for collecting meaningful data, think again: <a href='https://matomo.org/' rel='nofollow'>Matamo</a> is an open source tool that is installed directly on your own server. It guarantees that data is not shared with advertising agencies such as Google.</p><h4>Always, Always Prioritize Usability</h4><p>Surveillance capitalism and data tracking are heavily talked about problems related to ethical design these days. But we must not forget the importance of complying with the best practices of usability. Without it, design is unethical, as a lack of usability almost always entails the use of dark patterns. A good place to go to read more about core usability is <a href='https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/' rel='nofollow'>Nielsen Norman Group</a>.</p><p>Back in the early days, Jakob Nielsen defined 5 core components of usability:</p><ul><li>Learnability,</li><li>Efficiency,</li><li>Memorability</li><li>Errors, and</li><li>Satisfaction.</li></ul><p>To ensure a usable product, it’s crucial that these five components are front and center in the design and development process.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/8a1486fe-7a36-4e46-9588-881d2608f0a7/ethical-design-usability.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        While it may not be the most interesting 404 page around, <a href='https://www.apple.com/404' rel='nofollow'>Apple’s version</a> focuses on error prevention by offering us a forward path when we hit a lost page.            <p></p><h5>Don’t Ask For More Than You Need</h5><p>As with many other aspects in life, asking for more than you need results in exploitation. It’s common for e-commerce sites to ask for tons of information when people sign up for an account or buy a product. But if someone is buying a digital product (such as a book), there really is no need to ask for anything other than their email address.</p><p><a href='https://signal.org/' rel='nofollow'>Signal</a> is a great example. Private at its core, it doesn’t ask for anything more than the information that is absolutely necessary for people to start using the app right away.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/a5c39747-ea0d-4756-a44f-bbd02f6f6523/ethical-design-signal.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://signal.org/' rel='nofollow'>Signal</a> only asks for the phone number of the device during signup.            <h5>Be Transparent</h5><p><a href='https://www.norwegian.com/' rel='nofollow'>Norwegian.com</a> has perhaps one of the best airfare booking systems in the world. Not only is it convenient to use but they also offer full transparency in relation to their optional service fees, something that is often hidden away. Anyone who lives outside of an Amazon storage country knows how hard it is to find the actual delivery price of their location.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bc539d50-3e47-4ac7-a8a0-a2fd08d39346/ethical-design-norwegian.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <a href='https://www.norwegian.com/' rel='nofollow'>Norwegian.com</a> offers full transparency on all additional charges.            <h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The movement towards a more ethical future has begun. Change doesn’t happen radically short term unless it’s built into the core of the business model. But that doesn’t mean we cannot change the current state for the better. We can do so through incremental change; one step at a time. By working human-centered, by asking why, and by using best practices for ethical design. That’s our obligation as the ones who build products so deeply ingrained in people’s lives. What we do changes and shapes lives for better or for worse. I choose better.</p><h5>Learn More</h5><p>There are a lot of valuable resources available for anyone interested in ethical design.

We're looking for a Design Manager to help manage and grow our Platform Design Team at Zapier. Are you excited to foster a user-centered design culture in 100% remote company? Then keep reading!</div><div><br></div><div><h3>About You</h3></div><div><b><span>You put your teammate's and customer's needs first.</span>&nbsp;</b>You enjoy helping and enabling designers do great work. You set design strategy by aligning business strategy and our user's needs. You use data and user research to make human-centered design decisions. You challenge assumptions about what makes a design successful through encouraging divergent exploration and talking to users.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You're technically inclined.</b></span>&nbsp;The Platform team is responsible for all of the apps on Zapier. Notably, we have over 1000 partners who create, test, launch, maintain, and improve apps on the Zapier platform – and add dozens every month. The Platform is unique inside Zapier. They have&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;users: the end-users who use the apps on Zapier and the developers/partners building the apps. Serving both users effectively requires getting to know some of the technical inner-workings to help your team design effective solutions.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>You wear many hats.</span>&nbsp;</b>You are constantly learning and leveling up your management skills. You have the relevant design skills to build rapport with the Design Team. On a regular basis you can expect to be holding one on ones with designers, thinking through tricky design problems, reviewing design iterations, and helping prioritize design needs across the company that align with our business strategy.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>You have experience hiring and managing UX Researchers and Designers.</span>&nbsp;</b>This isn't your first rodeo. You may not have hired or managed hundreds of people before, but you have hired, trained and managed before.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You love collaboration and feedback.</b></span>&nbsp;You understand successful design doesn't happen in a vacuum or in secret. You believe in sharing work early, openly, and often. You enjoy working closely with Product Managers, Engineers, Data Scientists, and Customers to help make the Design Team's designs achieve effective results.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You know how design impacts development.</b></span>&nbsp;You've built functional web apps before. You understand the technical complexities a design might introduce, and can work through them with your teammates. You don't believe in “tossing designs over the wall,” and would dread doing so.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Things You Might Do</h3></div><div>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, your primary goal is to help achieve better design outcomes and here are some things you'll probably do:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Hold weekly one on ones with members of the Platform Design Team (Product Designers and UX Researchers).</li><li>Build rapport with each member of the Platform Design Team and work hard to help them level up their skills</li><li>Collaborate with platform leadership to understand business strategy and apply it to your team's work</li><li>Work to serve developers, product managers, and business development teams at our 1000+ partner organizations</li><li>Collaborate across functions to help set roadmaps that will achieve business goals through design</li><li>Advocate for and teach design skills across the organization. Find ways to involve non-designers in the design process through design sprints and other creative means</li><li>Help champion our Zapier design standards and visual identity</li><li>Provide feedback on design solutions through wireframes, mockups, and interactive prototypes</li><li>Participate in user research and other experiments to inform design decisions</li><li>Give, seek, and receive thoughtful critical feedback</li><li>Give back to the community via open source, blog posts, and&nbsp;<a href='https://dribbble.com/zapier?utm_source=zapier.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=zapier' rel='nofollow'>sharing design team work</a></li><li>Help recruit, onboard and train new Design Team members at Zapier</li><li>Help customers via All Hands Support to learn about Zapier and the product</li></ul><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p><a href='https://zapier.workable.com/j/E51078ADCA' rel='nofollow'>https://zapier.workable.com/j/E51078ADCA</a></p>  </div>",

That's where you come in.</p><p>As our first full-time Design hire, you’ll help define the way our product looks, acts, and sounds. You’ll produce assets at varying levels of fidelity across a wide variety of media, from paper sketches to interactive prototypes, chatbot tone to outdoor billboards.</p><p>You’ll collaborate closely with our Heads of Product, Technology, and Marketing to produce nuanced assets which reflect careful analysis of products that our community loves and hates, ground research, internal data, and your own inspiration.</p><p>We’re looking for a Senior Designer who is passionate, resourceful, and has a history of listening closely to discover what users need.

These three things let us work flexibly because we are consistently improving our forecasting ability and staying motivated to deliver for our members. </p><p>What does that mean for the day-to-day? It means a single team check-in at 9AM PT where you discuss your tasks for the day and any help you will need. Then, you're free to complete that task at your own pace and on your own schedule. We do a weekly retrospective to assess team performance, and a bi-weekly sprint planner. </p><p>Every team seeks to get something out into the wild every day - whether it's a paper prototype or a full deployment to production.</p><p>We take your personal development seriously - the better you are, the better we can deliver for our members and community.

We do code reviews, we don’t merge into mainstream any substantial code without being reviewed and approved.</p><p>For all the above reasons we are a teal organization. What does it mean?</p><p>Everyone at Cycloid meets once every quarter at our in France to define collectively the strategy/road map/features for the coming quarter. Then, everyone defines their own agenda and priorities that to achieve his own goal.</p><p>We are fully transparent on revenues, salaries and believe that everybody should have the same variable plan.</p><p>We have signed millions since our creation in April 2015, we are 100% self-funded and have neither external investors nor bank credits.</p><p>We take the time that we need to build useful products and provide great services.</p><h5>SKILLS</h5><p>You are a passionate software engineer, which is the most important, with years of experience crafting software and UI /UX expertise, would be better but not necessary. Skills are one thing, the behaviour is what is the most important. </p><p>You prefer and want to focus on the nowadays web frontend development, where frontends aren’t any more a simple mirror of information.You have some knowledge and experience with some backend development, would be better, so you can have an overall understanding of it.</p><p>Because you are focused on the frontend, you know how to build UIs which look professional, are usable and made with a little bit of passion, with passion it's always better.</p><p>Meanwhile, our current frontend is in VueJS, if you love VueJS you really should speak with us. We don’t require that you have any experience with it, but we expect that you have experience with frontend frameworks and you can show us that you understand the web mechanics, not only knowing the framework surface.</p><p>We are looking for a person who can build with us new features, can bring some new ideas on what could be a great DevOps platform/pipeline to simplify the work of others. If you don't have any ideas, it will be a challenge because we don't have a product manager and we are trying to work without it due to our culture. We want to empower people.</p><p>You are, of course, a team player and know how to work in remote even if you can work at Cycloid office in Paris if you are in Paris. You can also decide to work on remote. Our organization is in an asynchronous manner, keeping a good team culture through Slack and conference meetings.</p><p>You have adequate written and oral communication skills in English, any others languages would be a plus.</p><p>The salary will depend on your skills and your localization.</p><p><em>Cycloid is committed to having equality between women and men.
