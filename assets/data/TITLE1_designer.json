    "content": "[ LONDON APPLICANTS ONLY]<br /><br />The time has come! At last a designer advert that isn't boring! But why?<br /><br />Well because at BoxSmart, we are a team of interesting people that aren't boring in the tech world! We are ENERGY.<br /><br /><br />I’m not just saying this. This is the last advert and INSPIRATIONAL, REAL and GREAT designers needs to see!<br /><br />We are seeking someone that can offer<br />Web design<br />ASP net and coding backend<br />HTML pages for our mailouts<br />and more things you can offer!<br /><br />[Who is writing this ENERGETIC email???]<br /><br />We are BoxSmart. A team of over 13 individuals that help small brands get better pricing for their packaging needs.<br /><br />We built Boxsmart to help talented people launch their brands and leave the filthy rat race that London has made these days. So you can get an idea of the type of people that run this ship – GIVERS.<br /><br /><br />This role is really to find the right PERSON. A ‘right person’ will work with the Martketing Director (nifty place to be if you influence them with your talents. Plenty of room in a startup to climb the ladder? Just a thought…).<br /><br />The ‘Right Person’ is a subjective thing but we know what it is. We can carve any intern to wherever they wish to go if you are like the ‘Right Person’ for BoxSmart. So here goes:<br /><br /><br />1- Someone that has a sense of PURPOSE. That doesn’t chase money (it comes as the byproduct of good work. We look after our family/team. We commit to everyone that works here are BoxSmart).<br /><br /><br />2- Someone that is simply fed up of the rat race. That is ‘boxed’ (excuse the pun) in a fixed role and can’t dip their finger in certain areas. Well we need someone flexible and up for trying new areas of the business – that way you can fall into a role you love later on within the team (see… we DO care)<br /><br /><br />3- A ‘giver’, not a taker: So many people take, take, take. Nobody gives first. Everyone at BoxSmart TRUSTS and gives first. Can you?<br /><br /><br />4- Someone highly creative. Lateral and charismatic. This is ESSENTIAL. We will know in the first TWO MINUTES on our phone chat – so you can’t hide!<br /><br /><br /><br />5- Someone that eventually wants to run their own business. I mean, why would a business not want to hire someone with those aspirations? Probably someone that wants you good enough to exploit but not good enough for you to leave right? Well at boxsmart we always offer other business ventures we build and aim for everyone to enjoy their lives by embracing GROWTH (we currently have three businesses we are building, alongside this. The right person is always welcome to take the reins. I mean, why not?? A good person deserves to grow).<br /><br /><br />6- Someone that has a LIFE TOO! This role is remote. You visit the CEO/Marketing once a week or so and work via phone. You have a life. Can pay your bills and work SMART. We don’t need someone imprisoned at a desk. We are over that. In fact we all work from home, coffee shops and have board meetings over dinners at nice restaurants! Why not? We are clever and we work in a remote generation.<br /><br /><br />The role:<br /><br /><br />This is the part where we tell you the core basics of the role:<br /><br /><br /><br />A – To support the Ceo/Marketing team in rebuiding the website and making the other sites to come<br /><br />B - To help with digital mediums for the BoxSmart departments: Exhibitions/PouchSmart and other spin offs that we are launching!<br /><br /><br />And that’s it! Just someone that wants to team up!<br /><br />[What do i get?]<br />Well we will pay you a 'case by case' amount, BUT we can also offer you commissions on any results we get online. We also will, once you hit 6 months, give you equity in any new website you build!<br /><br />So it's someone looking for the LONG BALL as well as a decent amount in the short term. We want a member of the TEAM<br /><br /><br />We will teach you all aspects of business. You are on the pulse with the CEO and the privilege to work with a a great team!<br /><br /><br />So it’s not just a job! It’s a JOURNEY!<br /><br /><br /><br />Have a think,.. We need the right person… the rest will fall into place.<br /><br />Team BoxSmart!",

A company you’ve maybe heard of before, or maybe not, but either way you’ve landed on this page because you were at least a little curious, and we like that about you. We spend our time making it easier for SMBs to talk with their customers. Today Help Scout is used by more than 8,000 businesses in 140 countries.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for someone who’s really smart, and humble, and thorough, and meticulous, and self-motivated, and kind, and a little funny, and tenacious, and did I say self-motivated? Well, that’s because we’re a remote company! Being remote is fantastic, it’s empowering, and it’s perfect for people who like to be their own boss and push themselves to be at their very best every day.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s where you come in. As a Product Designer at Help Scout, you’ll spend your days creating tools that our customers use to deliver a great experience. Smiles on faces — if that’s your jam, we’d love to meet you.</div><div><h4>About the role:</h4></div><ul><li>You’ll be the sixth member of the Help Scout design team. We work remotely from places like New York, Sydney, Ireland and Nashville. You can work from wherever you please as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap with EDT (US East Coast).</li><li>We’ll ask you to own the entire design process. For a new project, you’ll be given a brief and will partner with Product to do User/Customer research. You’ll be doing the wireframes, prototyping, visual design, interaction design, and will partner with engineers to get the implementation juuuuuust right.</li><li>You’ll be embedded on a couple cross-functional teams with one product lead, one QA, and 2-5 engineers depending on the project. You’ll work hand-in-hand with your teammates to ship your best work to our customers.</li><li>Although each designer is embedded on different teams, it’s important that everyone makes each other better. Over Slack, video chats, and design docs, you’ll provide guidance and critical feedback on other work outside of your purview. You’ll also get that sort of support from your teammates on your projects.</li><li>You will have the freedom to pioneer your own discovery phase and find ways to improve our product. You’ll find that we’re passionate about putting in the work to constantly improve on the things we’ve made.</li><li>The role says “Senior” but we do not delineate between junior and senior designers on the team. We’re looking for senior-level skill and experience in every role at Help Scout, partially because it works better in a remote culture.</li></ul><div><h4>About you:</h4></div><ul><li>Your passion is to work on large-scale software a lot of people use, but to be given ownership of the project from concept to completion. The design challenges are complex, and the work has a bunch of constraints. Despite the difficulty, this is the work you love most.</li><li>We all love a good pattern library and pixel-perfect design, but you prefer to get involved in a project way before then. For you, it starts with sketches, wireframes and a keen understanding of the problem from all angles.</li><li>You’re very thorough and detail-oriented. You don’t get tired of solving a problem and iterating on the solution, even after a few months of working towards the best experience.</li><li>You’re humble, yet opinionated about what makes a great product experience. You leverage your skills and expertise to help others and make the people around you better at their craft.</li><li>You have more than a few years of design experience, and you’ve grown so much that you cringe when you look back at your early work.</li><li>You can simplify complex problems and clearly articulate your thought process to others in writing. This is especially important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You collaborate well and communicate early and often. You explain your work by extrapolating on everything from your inklings and curiosities, to the rationale behind final your decisions.</li><li>You actively seek critical feedback. As a matter of fact, you can’t get enough of it, because you know that your work only gets better when your team puts their eyes on it.</li><li>You have strong taste, and your eye for visual design is as strong as your ability to dream up exceptional customer experiences.</li><li>You prefer to collaborate directly with developers and product stakeholders, carefully considering the tension between business and customer needs.</li><li>When it comes to understanding a problem, you have no hesitation in setting up customer interviews, doing usability testing, or conducting a survey.</li><li>This isn’t an absolute requirement, but strong HTML and CSS skills will likely make you a more successful product designer at Help Scout. If you can write JavaScript, it’s all the better, but we won’t ask you to write production code.</li></ul><div><h4>Who you'll work with</h4></div><ul><li><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindaeliasen/' rel='nofollow'>Linda Eliasen</a>, Design Team Lead - You’ll be reporting to Linda.

You would have an important role in helping us redesign key parts of our app UI, and would also be part of an overall effort to create and standardize our design system. We're also looking for someone to help us grow as a team and solidify our design processes.</span><b><strong></strong></b></div><div><br></div><div><b><strong>The kind of work we do</strong></b><b><br></b></div><div><span>BriteCore is essentially a CMS for insurance companies. They use it to manage all aspects of their business, including tracking policies, managing contacts and handling claims.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>This means our users typically see our app more as a business tool like Microsoft Word or Google Sheets than a website (even though it is completely a web-based app). They also are using BriteCore for several hours every day, and are concerned with doing things quickly and efficiently. This, along with the complicated nature of insurance, means we deal with some complex workflows, and try to set ourselves apart from our competitors with a smooth UX that helps them navigate these tough processes.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><strong>What you might be doing</strong></b><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>We’re looking for a team member who thinks critically about user experience, and is able to see it through with a polished interface.

    "content": "Role: Designer, Heist Studios<br />Reporting to: Art Director<br />Location: Clerkenwell, London<br /><br />Our vision<br /><br />At Heist, we believe underwear can be an instrument of progress. While many industries understand our era’s desire for autonomy, choice and freedom, women’s underwear has lagged behind. Effectively, all women are living in underwear inadequate to their time.  <br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in underwear design can ensure that every woman, every day, is living in underwear that allows her to progress in the way that she demands in every other area of her life. That’s why our designs are built on an understanding of how bodies move, not just how they look.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane wardrobe staple, a pair of tights, into a product that redefines superiority in comfort and fit for every female body. We’re now using polymer physics, computational engineering models and 3D knitwear to reinvent shapewear. Next, we’ll be taking our design ethos to make a bra that actually fits. (Finally!)<br /><br />Our journey<br /><br />We may be only two years old, but it’s already been quite a ride. Our first range reinvented the humble pair of tights, delivering 30% month-on-month growth and propelling us into the pages of almost every major European publication. We’re backed by some of the biggest investors in fashion and technology, and on a busy day, we can sell a pair of tights every 15 seconds. Even our tube adverts caused a scandal. Most importantly, we have tens of thousands of customers who genuinely love Heist and the products we develop and ship around the world. We are continually growing and creating a creative brand that not just looks good, but also tell a story.    <br />Your responsibilities<br /><br />As Designer, you will work on a range of tasks from designing emails and banners to advertising, across both print and digital. You will be working within our Creative team, supporting them on day to day tasks as we continue to grow.<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />•    Design work for new banner ads, print and web material.<br />•    Be able to constantly think of new designs to push Heist forward.<br />•    Ability to take ownership of design projects across multiple platforms both online and offline.<br />•    Provide final artwork across a wide range of projects, from print advertising through to display ads and social posts.

Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</div><div><br></div><div>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and we are looking for a UX / UI Designer to join GMB.

We deliver products, solutions and platforms built using blockchain technology to transform how business is done in complex network of buyers, suppliers and consumers.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, the music industry, security, and infrastructure, and more. To accomplish this we've built out a flat organizational structure which we call the ConsenSys Mesh: a network of individuals &amp; teams working autonomously and towards the same goal.  Our mission is to use these decentralized solutions to fundamentally reshape the economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us.</p><p> <br>About the role:</p><p>As a Design Facilitator you will work collaboratively, creatively, and flexibly with interdisciplinary teams and with our clients. The Design Facilitation practice at ConsenSys is primarily driven by our desire to help our teams and customers use Design Thinking to achieve outstanding, human-centered results. The Design Thinking team at ConsenSys currently consists of two facilitators and is projected to grow to four by July 2018. Future growth will depend on demand for Design Thinking from the wider organisation.</p><p>What gets us excited:</p><p>-You have a proven history of using design thinking in a variety of ways and in a variety of locations and cultures, at lots of different places from big to small companies, and start-ups.<br>-A strong point of view - you aren’t just along for the ride. Lots of blog posts and videos and podcasts (for example) where we can learn about what you care about and how you express yourself.<br>-Background in teaching and making your own courses and curriculum.<br>-References who will say lots of nice things about you and help us understand how you would fit in at ConsenSys.<br>-A passion for exploring the possibilities of blockchain technology.</p><p>Responsibilities:</p><p>-Run workshops in all forms — a facilitator needs to have a comprehensive grasp of design thinking at a sophisticated level, including methods and mindsets. You need to be able to effectively guide a team of people through the design thinking framework in person and remotely. Please note that we are not looking for theoretical trainers - you must be experienced at delivering hands-on facilitation services.<br>-Advocate, inspire, reflect—we’re going to be building the airplane as we fly it. The facilitator also needs to be a content creator and think about how to better apply design thinking in the venture accelerator model.<br>-Client facing — for ConsenSys to succeed, we will need to interact with potential customers and users in order to understand their worlds, needs, and aspirations. The facilitator needs to be comfortable working with people outside the organization. Typical client sessions will be for consulting engagements and for helping teams co-create with their users.<br>-Teaching and modeling — helping teams get better at design thinking so they can apply it on their own in-between facilitator-led workshops.<br>-Stay on your feet—a facilitator is always actively adapting to the environment they’re shaping. You need to know when to be flexible, when to hold firm, and how to calmly navigate ever-changing waters.<br>-Staying organized—tracking who is asking for workshops, when you are running workshops, when you are traveling, finding supplies, planes, and hotels. Being an independent facilitator has a lot of moving pieces and you’ll most be on your own to handle your schedule.</p><p>Requirements:</p><p>-You understand human-centered design philosophy and love sharing design methodologies.<br>-You really care about how process turns innovative ideas into awesome realities.<br>-You love to learn. Blockchain, design thinking, and software development are all young enough disciplines that there is an endless amount to discover and invent.<br>-Test and learn is part of your DNA.<br>-You restlessly reinvent yourself and your facilitation practice.<br>-You question everything! You regularly ask yourself “Why does it have to be this way and how can it be better?”<br>-Self starter— you won’t have a manager in this role.  No one will tell you what you have to do, and you work better that way.<br> </p><p>Some perspectives on facilitation to check out:</p><p><a href='https://medium.com/design-ibm/build-experiences-not-features-9ae0d2c0117a' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/design-ibm/build-experiences-not-features-9ae0d2c0117a</a></p><p><a href='https://medium.com/design-ibm/prototyping-ibm-design-thinking-method-cards-1328080da382' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/design-ibm/prototyping-ibm-design-thinking-method-cards-1328080da382</a></p><p><a href='https://medium.com/design-ibm/facilitator-unconference-2017-with-design-at-business-d20696ab6354' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/design-ibm/facilitator-unconference-2017-with-design-at-business-d20696ab6354</a></p><p> </p><p>Application instructions:</p><p>Cover letters and resumes are not required.
