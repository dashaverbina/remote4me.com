We're a smart, passionate group of people who work hard to deliver the best survey experiences on the planet, period. We believe everyone deserves easy access to the information and insights they need to make great decisions.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We're also proud to admit that despite our incredible growth over the past 17 years, we refuse to grow up. We stay curious. We believe in good ol’ roll-up-your-sleeves scrappiness. Everyone plays an impactful role, because we’re here to make a difference. And when we say good ideas can come from anyone, we mean it.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>SurveyMonkey is trusted by millions of customers, including 99% of the Fortune 500, as well as other businesses, academic institutions and organizations of all shapes and sizes. We collect over 3 million survey responses daily from people in all countries around the world.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>SurveyMonkey is the world’s most popular survey platform. While it is a great general-purpose tool used by millions, there is ample opportunity for more specialized solutions. That’s where we come in. We build standalone, targeted SaaS products that bring great UX to solving more specific business problems.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>To date, our 10-person team has shipped three products:</div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement </li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Source and publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li></ul><div></div><div>We operate each solution as a small startup within the larger SurveyMonkey organization. This affords us flexibility to quickly try new ideas, but with the resources of larger company. Our goal -- and our track record -- is to build high growth, profitable businesses that leverage the enormous user base of SurveyMonkey.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We’re looking for a talented designer with demonstrable experience working on user-friendly SaaS applications. Your portfolio should demonstrate the ability to design for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop. You should also be comfortable writing clear, concise UI copy.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Strong visual design, product design, usability, and communication skills are essential. Technical skills such as CSS, Javascript, and familiarity with Ruby on Rails are also a strong plus, though not required. Experience mentoring and/or managing junior designers would also be a big plus. </div><div><br></div><div></div><div>If you like working closely with developers and other designers and love designing data-rich visualizations, we should talk. If you think of yourself as a product designer as much as a UX designer, we should definitely talk. If you have some Tufte books on your shelf and are the kind of person others look to to tease out subtle edge cases in an interface, we should <em>absolutely</em> talk.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>Why Work Here?</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific timezone by at least four hours, where you live and work and up to you. We’re not strangers though -- in addition to a sane amount of video calls, we meet up quarterly to get to know each other better and have some fun. In the past year, we've been bowling in Phoenix, made sushi in San Francisco, and toured a brewery.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. As such, you will be expected to be a manager of one.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Naturally, we offer competitive salaries and annual bonuses, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and meaningful equity compensation. We also supply you with top of the line equipment for your home office.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Finally, in a world of clunky “enterprise” software, we consider great UX and visual design to be a strategic advantage, and we need you to help us keep improving. Our track record gives our team a lot of autonomy -- this is your chance to rethink how “business solutions” should look and function, and to have fun while doing it.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>The Team</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our ten person team is responsible for building products from soup to nuts. We often wear many hats and work across both the technical stack and departments. You’ll have the opportunity to work with people who have successfully launched (and sold) products. </div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Most of us choose to focus on one solution at a time. We feel this allows us to fully embrace and understand our customer needs and develop a deep technical understanding of the problem domain. However, we are also committed to sharing our work - not just with each other, but via open source contributions to our code library, Pano.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Outside of work, we are well-rounded people with diverse interests from winemaking to music to sculpture. Several of us have kids (and we actually get to see them). </div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Join us.</div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p><a href='http://grnh.se/jd1fyr1' rel='nofollow'>http://grnh.se/jd1fyr1</a></p>  </div>",

We're a smart, passionate group of people who work hard to deliver the best survey experiences on the planet, period. We believe everyone deserves easy access to the information and insights they need to make great decisions.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We're also proud to admit that despite our incredible growth over the past 17 years, we refuse to grow up. We stay curious. We believe in good ol’ roll-up-your-sleeves scrappiness. Everyone plays an impactful role, because we’re here to make a difference. And when we say good ideas can come from anyone, we mean it.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>SurveyMonkey is trusted by millions of customers, including 99% of the Fortune 500, as well as other businesses, academic institutions and organizations of all shapes and sizes. We collect over 3 million survey responses daily from people in all countries around the world.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>SurveyMonkey is the world’s most popular survey platform. While it is a great general-purpose tool used by millions, there is ample opportunity for more specialized solutions. That’s where we come in. We build standalone, targeted SaaS products that bring great UX to solving more specific business problems.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>To date, our 10-person team has shipped three products:</div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement </li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Source and publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li></ul><div></div><div>We operate each solution as a small startup within the larger SurveyMonkey organization. This affords us flexibility to quickly try new ideas, but with the resources of larger company. Our goal -- and our track record -- is to build high growth, profitable businesses that leverage the enormous user base of SurveyMonkey.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We’re looking for a talented designer with demonstrable experience working on user-friendly SaaS applications. Your portfolio should demonstrate the ability to design for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop. You should also be comfortable writing clear, concise UI copy.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Strong visual design, product design, usability, and communication skills are essential. Technical skills such as CSS, Javascript, and familiarity with Ruby on Rails are also a strong plus, though not required. Experience mentoring and/or managing junior designers would also be a big plus. </div><div><br></div><div></div><div>If you like working closely with developers and other designers and love designing data-rich visualizations, we should talk. If you think of yourself as a product designer as much as a UX designer, we should definitely talk. If you have some Tufte books on your shelf and are the kind of person others look to to tease out subtle edge cases in an interface, we should <em>absolutely</em> talk.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>Why Work Here?</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific timezone by at least four hours, where you live and work and up to you. We’re not strangers though -- in addition to a sane amount of video calls, we meet up quarterly to get to know each other better and have some fun. In the past year, we've been bowling in Phoenix, made sushi in San Francisco, and toured a brewery.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. As such, you will be expected to be a manager of one.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Naturally, we offer competitive salaries and annual bonuses, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and meaningful equity compensation. We also supply you with top of the line equipment for your home office.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Finally, in a world of clunky “enterprise” software, we consider great UX and visual design to be a strategic advantage, and we need you to help us keep improving. Our track record gives our team a lot of autonomy -- this is your chance to rethink how “business solutions” should look and function, and to have fun while doing it.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>The Team</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our ten person team is responsible for building products from soup to nuts. We often wear many hats and work across both the technical stack and departments. You’ll have the opportunity to work with people who have successfully launched (and sold) products. </div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Most of us choose to focus on one solution at a time. We feel this allows us to fully embrace and understand our customer needs and develop a deep technical understanding of the problem domain. However, we are also committed to sharing our work - not just with each other, but via open source contributions to our code library, Pano.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Outside of work, we are well-rounded people with diverse interests from winemaking to music to sculpture. Several of us have kids (and we actually get to see them). </div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Join us.</div><div><br></div><p><strong>To apply:</strong> <a href='http://grnh.se/jd1fyr1' rel='nofollow'>http://grnh.se/jd1fyr1</a></p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Boston, MA or remote)</strong> </p><p><strong>DockYard is looking for a great UX and Visual designer to join our team.</strong></p><p>The ideal candidate is someone who:</p><ul><li>Can demonstrate a strong user-centric approach to their work</li><li>Has been part of the user research process in the past</li><li>Has previous client services experience</li><li>Shows strength in typography, color, and information layout</li></ul><p>We value diversity and strongly encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.</p><h2>More about the job</h2><p>We’re a design-driven software consultancy. We make web applications, focusing on Progressive Web Apps. Our projects can last between several weeks and several months. Many of our client projects are “greenfield”, so you’ll have the opportunity to define the core concepts that will have impact throughout the application and be built upon as the product grows.</p><p>Our designers work with the most innovative clients in the industry, and provide design leadership in collaboration with DockYard’s Engineering team. Designers don’t code their own HTML/CSS, but a familiarity with how the web is built is a big plus.</p><p><strong>We are a fully distributed company, with the design team clustered around Boston. This is a 100% remote position as of now.&nbsp;</strong>Some availability to travel is expected.</p><p>Because designers start projects and communicate directly with clients and the rest of the team each day, we value writing and communication skills. We also help you develop these skills, and grow professionally in other ways: a conference / education budget, DockYard Friday projects, and internal training are all part of the deal.</p><h2>Responsibilities</h2><ul><li>Work directly with clients</li><li>Gather project requirements from various stakeholders</li><li>Create visual assets to support product discovery: from rough sketches to user flows to wireframes</li><li>Create polished visual design layouts</li><li>Collaborate with HTML/CSS engineers to ensure quality and implementability</li></ul><p>If this working style interests you, we’d love to hear from you! Individual applications only, please: we do not work with recruiters and aren’t looking to outsource work.</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> DockYard Fridays! One day a week, we switch away from client work. Instead, we teach ourselves something new, work on internal projects, and experiment. We offer full health, vision &amp; dental benefits plus a 401K plan, send you to one industry conference each year, and hold regular company team-building activities.</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> To apply, please include:- your portfolio &amp; resume- why you’re interested in DockYard specifically- what you hope to do with your career in the next 3 years</p>",

We’re Action Verb.</p><p>We build two Infrastructure-as-a-Service Platforms that empower organizations worldwide.</p><p>Our products include&nbsp;<a href='https://brickftp.com/' rel='nofollow'>BrickFTP</a>, a hosted file sharing service for business, and&nbsp;<a href='https://vaeplatform.com/' rel='nofollow'>Vae Platform</a>, a unique web hosting platform with an integrated CMS system.</p><p>Our company consists of 15 (but growing to 19 by the end of the year) full time USA-based staff, as well as sales and support outposts in France, Germany, and Latin America.</p><p>Our infrastructure platforms are used by over 2,000 enterprises and SMBs, including Mozilla, Canonical, UPS, DirecTV, GoPro, Marriott, and more.</p><p><strong>Our Success Strategy</strong></p><p>We’ve been able to achieve the rare combination of high double-digit annual growth and industry leading profitability.</p><p>We do it by aggressively recruiting the absolute best and brightest people and structuring our company in a way that makes them want to work here forever.</p><p>It’s easy to say, but exceptionally hard to execute. Here’s how we do it.</p><p><strong>We Practice Holacracy</strong></p><p><strong>We are one of the early adopters of&nbsp;<a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>Holacracy</a></strong>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</p><p>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well rounded team members with skills in software engineering, design, marketing, sales, and our other needs who are interested in filling multiple roles within the organization.</p><p><strong>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our role descriptions are regularly updated via small iterations.</strong>&nbsp;As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</p><p><em>&quot;Most startups believe in iteration of their products. Now they need to apply the same thinking to their organizations.&quot;<br>– Adam Pisoni, Yammer co-founder &amp; CTO</em></p><p>Holacracy is not unstructured: you’ll have a clear understanding of your current roles and responsibilities, as well as a set of rules and processes for changing those roles and responsibilities in real time.</p><p>Even though Holacracy is a lot to learn, we have a great onboarding process and the rest of our team will guide you through your first few months. You’ll also have the opportunity to attend a weeklong official Holacracy training event at our expense.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/holacracy' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OUR HOLACRACY PRACTICE<span>→</span></a></p><p>We also practice Open Book Management, meaning that we share the exact details of our Balance Sheet and P&amp;L Statement with our entire team in real-time, ensuring that&nbsp;<strong>our staff has the data they need to treat the business as if it were their own.</strong></p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/open-book-management' rel='nofollow'>MORE ABOUT OPEN BOOK MANAGEMENT<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Our team members work from home and choose their own hours</strong>, allowing them to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to them.</p><p>Every full-time team member gets 10 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 paid time off days intended to be used for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p><strong>Our team members also work hard, are constantly learning, and accomplish a ton for the company in the time that they are working.</strong></p><p>Our team spends at least 12 days together face-to-face per year at four to six in-person meetings spread out through the year and hosted all over the country. We try to do these meetings in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, Minneapolis, San Diego, Las Vegas, New York City, Detroit, and Fort Lauderdale.</p><p><strong>Design Skills We’re Looking For</strong></p><p>This position is designed to appeal to designers who are not afraid to get their hands dirty writing code. You will be working on web applications, mobile apps, desktop apps, marketing websites, and email.</p><p><strong>We are looking for candidates who bring the following skills to the table:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with web application design, marketing website design, and offline (print) design</li><li>Comprehensive understanding of UI/UX principles</li><li>Solid web front-end development skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Even though we have a great team to help you integrate your designs with our applications, in order to be a great application designer, we expect that you can implement enough JavaScript to make your designs come to life (even in a basic way).</li><li>Experience and interest in both actual application design and marketing design. We want our designers to be able to work on both sides.</li><li>History designing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li></ul><p><strong>Our best applicants tend to have at least 5 years history</strong>&nbsp;of producing marketing websites and web or mobile applications.</p><p>We expect to see an extensive portfolio that includes both static websites and applications.</p><p><strong>Some of Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><p><strong>We believe that everyone in the company should have programming skills.</strong>&nbsp;We want everyone here to be able to take their ideas and bring them to life. For designers, that means you have to be able to write code. It doesn’t mean you have to be an expert, but you should at least be able to implement intermediate-level jQuery and also work with React.</p><p><strong>We believe that allowing and supporting 100% remote work gives us access to great people we wouldn’t otherwise be able to hire.</strong>&nbsp;We tend to hire folks who are later in their careers, which means they usually have their family established somewhere. By offering remote work, we can hire the best people, no matter where they’re located.</p><p><strong>We believe that the best way we can acquire top talent is by being an amazing place to work.</strong>&nbsp;Work from home, travel with the team, and surround yourself with top tier people at Action Verb.&nbsp;<a href='https://actionverb.com/working-at-action-verb' rel='nofollow'>Read about everything we’ve done to make working at Action Verb great.</a></p><p><strong>We believe that building great infrastructure and platform products requires a great internal infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;We have Continuous Integration, a full staging environment, and considerable test coverage. We built our own application deployment system. We self-manage our server environment on Amazon Web Services and custom hardware.</p><p><strong>We believe that engineers should support what they build.</strong>&nbsp;We expect our teammates to take responsibilty for the engineering decisions they make. If there are performance problems in production, nobody should have to chase anyone down. All engineers participate in a 24/7 on-call rotation and all engineers speak to customers.</p><p><strong>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves.</strong>&nbsp;We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><p><a href='http://actionverb.com/core-beliefs' rel='nofollow'>READ THE REST OF OUR CORE BELIEFS<span>→</span></a></p><p><strong>Salary and Pay</strong></p><p>As you might expect from a company that is so open, we also post our salary information right here in the job post.&nbsp;<strong>We will pay you $100,000 in your first year, plus a great benefits package, and a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer.</strong></p><p>After your first year with Action Verb, we will update your salary based on the value that you have been able to demonstrate for the company. We continue to update salary levels every year. It is possible to reach a pay level of double the starting salary if you come in and absolutely crush it.</p><p>We fully pay for your health insurance (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 50% of your spouse or family if they wish to also join the healthcare plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p><p>We recognize that other companies may offer higher initial salary offers or signing bonuses, but at Action Verb,&nbsp;<strong>we know that for our ideal candidate, the exact level of pay is just one criteria by which they choose where to work.</strong>&nbsp;Our goal is to offer the greatest work environment possible and pay people well enough to make it possible for them to join the team. Come learn our way of working, take on as many roles as you can, and establish yourself as a valuable asset to us. Then after your first year, we’ll re-evaluate your salary and make sure it’s more than fair, given the value you’ve been able to generate for the company.</p><p><strong>Plus, you can join Action Verb Risk Free because of our $7,500 Quitting Bonus Within Your First 90 Days.</strong></p><p>We get it. Holacracy is new. Working remote is hard. We love these things about our culture, but you might not be sure if you do. Or maybe you just don’t trust us that we really do embody the Core Beliefs on this webpage. To our prospects who may be on the fence about joining Action Verb, we want to make one more offer to push you over the edge and convince you to join us.</p><p>If you don’t like working at Action Verb for any reason, quit within the first 90 days and receive a $7,500 quitting bonus. That should be enough to keep you and your family afloat while you decide on your next path. We hope that you won’t take us up on the offer, but we want you to feel good knowing that it’s there.</p><p><strong>Ready To Apply?</strong></p><p>Working here isn’t for everyone, but if you think it might be for you,&nbsp;<strong>please apply</strong>.</p><p>We only read cover letters in our first screening round, so make sure yours counts. The following are topics we’d like to see addressed in your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Why does this opportunity specifically appeal to you?</li><li>How well do you align with Our Core Beliefs? Is there anything you would add or change?</li><li>Why would working remotely for Action Verb change your life for the better?</li><li>Are you familiar with Holacracy? Any questions or concerns?</li><li>What’s lacking in your current work arrangement that we could improve?</li><li>What are your philosophies on design?</li><li>What does designing great software look like?</li></ul><p>We look forward to reading your letter!</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully Remote Company!
