Our mission is to eliminate hours of research for thousands of activities like tango lessons, intro photography classes, or Italian cooking sessions. All the information is in one place instead of the usual process of Googling, picking nearby locations, checking prices, manually comparing schedules (which are each presented differently), and then exchanging emails to lock it down.</p><p>The Vimbly team is a diverse, smart and energetic group of problem solvers. &nbsp;We are each experts in our specific trade, unified by a passion to build a great product that will change the way people discover activities, date ideas, things to do, and life experiences.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Health / dental / vision insurance                            </div>                            <div>                                 Activity budget to try items on Vimbly                            </div>                            <div>                                 Unlimited vacation days (just get your work done)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Monthly massage and optional monthly manicure... and they come to you                            </div>                            <div>                                 Monthly social outings (laser tag and paintball?
