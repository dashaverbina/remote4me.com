But we’re even prouder of the fact that we’re a platform that serves developers, and we’re helping them build their own complex business process applications that require extensive forms and APIs to support them. No other platform provides developers the tools that we provide them.</p><p>We are growing rapidly, and have more work and opportunities than we have people to accomplish them. That’s where you come in!</p><p>If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have extensive experience with Javascript on *both* the front end and the back end. You’re excited about all the new technologies coming down the pike like typescript, angular 5, vue, ES2018 and are a super quick study. This isn’t your first rodeo. You’ve got 5 or more years of experience, and can point to multiple apps or sites you have helped ship.</p><p>That’s a really quick intro of what we are looking for but first you need to know what it is like working for us.</p><h5>A little about us</h5><p>We’re an early-stage company that provides our customers a powerful and unique combined Form and API platform designed specifically for developers!We have something that no-one else has, and we’ve achieved significant traction in the market and adoption byenterprises all over the world, ranging from startups, SMBs, to large enterprises, who operate in a wide range of business verticals including healthcare, education, government agencies, insurance, banking and financial services, legal, online retail, industrial, compliance, agricultural, software agencies, and many others. We are fully funded, have been cash flow positive for a while, and are rapidly growing our MRR revenue without needing to search for new investment capital.</p><p>We love building tools that make data collection and management easier for developers building web apps. As part of that we’ve developed tons of front end and back end components and tools in many frameworks and technologies.</p><h5>Who you’d be working with</h5><p>Our team is is small, tightly knit, and highly collaborative group of contributors. We are headquartered in Dallas, TX, but we have several remote developers as well, and we work very well over remote by utilizing conference and chatroom tools.</p><p><strong>Travis</strong> - the founding father and CTO of Form.io leads the team with technology insight and vision, combined with the powerful ability to roll up his sleeves and dive deep into the code with any issue. Travis is known within the company, and by our customers, for solving insanely complex problems over a weekend that would take a normal developer a month. Travis has a strong presence and following in the developer community, and much of his work can be found on Github and YouTube. Travis spends his free time with his wife and kids.</p><p><strong>Randall</strong> - our Lead Architect and sometimes described as “The most interesting developer in the world” due to his extensive worldwide traveling, and his tendency to tell crazy stories. . When not doing home improvement work on his house, or going to his daughters’ ballet classes, he’s resolving conflicting bug fixes and designing our next generation platform. If you have a problem, Randall can solve it, just don't get him started telling a story or you'll never get away.</p><p>And the rest of our extremely talented team including Gary Denise , Angel, Jeriah, Robert, Edwin, Rakesh, Yury and Alena.</p><h5>How you’ll work at Form.io</h5><p>We’re a group of dedicated and talented people - the kind you’d be excited to work with. Here’s what that looks like.</p><p><strong>Live where you want</strong> - We’re mostly located in the Dallas area but we do have very productive members of our team elsewhere. We all work from home a portion of the time, so we’re very good at using tools that enable remote work. Due to market demands and activities, and time zone overlaps we're currently looking specifically for new team members in the US and also in Australia, (but of course we’re also open to attracting exceptional talent from other regions too!)</p><p><strong>No crazy hours</strong> - We’re a startup but we realize that overworking our developers doesn’t make the process faster or better. We’re more interested in you developing great code and solving problems than working crazy hours.</p><p><strong>We’re all adults</strong> - There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor. We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit in front of a computer.</p><p><strong>World class tools</strong> - We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer (probably a mac) and replace it every three years.</p><p><strong>Solve important problems</strong> - We’re constantly doing hard things that are fun and helping companies work. We spend a lot of time designing new systems and solutioning problems for our customers.</p><p><strong>Learn new things</strong> - We’re built on latest generation technology and are always on the lookout for what’s new. Be prepared to constantly be learning promising new technologies and figuring out how they can make our company better.</p><p><strong>Testing is not a dirty word</strong> - We believe in automated testing. Bug fixes as well as new features should come with automated tests to ensure they work and make sure they don’t break in the future.</p><h5>Now, back to you, our new Javascript Developer…</h5><p>You’re a javascript developer with over 5 years of experience. You’ve done work with both the frontend (angular, react, vue, etc) and the backend (nodejs). You understand what makes javascript javascript with concepts like asynchronous functions, promises, scoping and prototypical inheritance. You also stay on top of the latest ES6 features like classes, arrow functions, destructuring and typescript. You know how to write east-to-maintain code, documentation while getting things done under pressure.</p><p>You’ll help us continue building out our platform, client apps and develop new functionality. There are always a ton of new client requests coming in as well as helping them set up their projects and learn how to build with our tools. In addition, there are the new features and functionality. We have a roadmap full of exciting new features such as form workflow, payment gateways, 3rd party platform integrations, and new framework support.</p><p>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer who doesn’t write only so that the computer can understand your code, but also so other developers can understand it too.</li><li>Are a fast learner of new technologies and keep on top of new trends.</li><li>Are a top notch debugger. You can find problems quickly and understand how to fix them without breaking other functionality.</li><li>Are self motivated and take responsibility for fixing problems like:<ul><li>“The form is too slow if you configure it like …”</li><li>&quot;Add paypal integration to this app”</li><li>&quot;We need to allow international versions of the phone field”</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple frameworks with different technologies.</li><li>Have experience with<ul><li>React/Vue/Angular/AngularJS</li><li>Nodejs/Express</li><li>Mongodb</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES2015/Typescript</li></ul></li><li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one app in one of the above frameworks.</li><li>Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li><li><strong>Bonus</strong> - You already use form.io!</li></ul><p><em>Form.io is an equal opportunity employer. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to build and expand a smart, hard-working team that loves working together to build something exciting and relevant.</em></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly.

Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.</p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and <a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement.</p><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a> with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d <a href='https://cl.ly/2i0V3z453H2K' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>this blog post</a>, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack developer that can build features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile) and challenge our thinking on architecture. Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Pushing our thinking on core architecture choices</li><li>Be part of leading a high-performing team: inspiring team members, set priorities and own results</li><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Interview process <br></strong>Interview processes&nbsp;don’t need to be scary and stressful for us to be able to pick out those of you that would fit in the best at Aula. The first three stages all take place asynchronously in a dedicated Slack channel filled with other curious and smart candidates - it’s turned out to be <a href='https://cl.ly/1P1P2i0k1320' rel='nofollow'>quite a community</a>. You’ll chat with Oliver about your experience and your thoughts particular topics. You’ll then receive a (~5 hour) test to complete over the course of 48 hours - on the weekend if you’d like. Then you get to meet the team on video conference. If both parties feel comfortable, we’ll then give you an offer to join us. The whole process takes place over the course of around 10 days, in your own time.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role.
