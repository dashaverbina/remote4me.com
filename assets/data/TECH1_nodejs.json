You regularly work with engineers and other stakeholders from various disciplines, balancing engineering concerns, such as technical debt, with product concerns. Ideally, you find solutions that address both the team and user needs but if not, help build understanding around difficult decisions.</p><br><p>You can keep track of, prioritize, and lead multiple projects.&nbsp;We're a small team, and there's no shortage of things you could be doing in a day. You'll carve out time for functional projects and make sure they solve real problems the team faces – ideally making development even easier.</p><br><p><strong>Things You Might Do</strong></p><br><p>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:</p><br><ul><br><li>Develop effective ways to communicate, monitor, and lead your team through weekly one-on-one’s and team meetings.</li><br><li>Keep the leadership team informed on your team’s progress in ways that are easy and enjoyable to receive, like one-on-one's, update posts, and regular team hangouts.</li><br><li>Build rapport with each member of the Front End Engineering Team and support them through coaching and mentorship to help level up their skills.</li><br><li>Participate in code reviews, learning and spreading technical knowledge throughout Zapier – moving knowledge to documentation where appropriate.</li><br><li>Occasionally dive into the code; fixing bugs, improving developer experience, smoothing edges – sometimes even spiking out small proofs of concept.</li><br><li>Collaborate across various disciplines (Product Managers, Designers, Researchers) to help set technical roadmaps that will achieve business goals through engineering best practices.</li><br><li>Actively recruit, onboard, and train new engineers at Zapier. This might involve tweaking the skills portions of interviews, or writing better documentation.</li><br><li>As part of our&nbsp;<a href='https://zapier.com/learn/customer-support/everyone-on-support/' rel='nofollow'>All Hands Support</a>&nbsp;initiative, help customers have the best experience with Zapier as possible.</li><br></ul></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

    "content": "*Full Stack Software Engineer (Go/Javascript/HTML/CSS)*<br /><br />To us, being a Full Stack engineer is a mindset, you need to be competent in your core skills and excited to learn and try new things as and when you see a fit or need.  No one wants to spread themselves too thinly and that is why we have carefully selected our few core technologies but we are not afraid of trying anything new that may be right for the job.  If you agree with this then read on, it should hopefully mean that you are someone that likes to self improve.<br />This role is to be the first tech hire alongside Nub’s founder.  You will be a key hire and valued highly if you can work hard as a team towards the aims of the company.  Your judgement will be valued as we work towards engineering a unique multi-platform application with a web app based UI and a Go based back end.<br /><br />*About you:*<br />- You are a dedicated and resourceful engineer<br />- 2+ years of professional Full Stack Software Engineering Experience<br />- Proven experience of completing HTML/CSS/Javascript deliverables (web app development not brochure style websites)<br />- Competence in Go (Golang) but if you have experience delivering software with another language (such as Python) and are keen to learn Go that may work.<br />- Competence writing SQL<br />- Happy to work with Node.js, Electron, ES6, Babel, Webpack.<br />- Exposure to Vuejs or similar (e.g. react)<br />- You love staying on top of the latest developments in software development <br />- Must be authorized to work in the UK<br />- Happy to work from home but meet in London for regular meetings.<br /><br />*About Nub:*<br />Lego for written comms. Modular utility, ubiquity and unique accessibility.<br /><br />Nub makes sending beautiful and personalised emails, invoices, forms, itineraries, receipts etc as easy as building with lego.  Comprised of an engine and codeless tools to automate data capture, data manipulation and subsequent output primarily via email, pdf, print, data, or api.  Triggered by any system, language or data and achieved without the need to be a programmer.<br /><br />This kit will mean everyone can create cool customer communications on a new, automated, intuitive and scalable platform.  It will allow anyone to handle data transformation and create automated output such as print, pdf or email.  Have control over branding, designs customisation and personalisation.<br /><br />Developers will love this because it removes a complex distraction from their applications. Companies large and small will love this because it will allow custom communications from any system to their employees or clients.<br />Anyone looking to automate data transformation from one format to the other will love this because  they will find it a breeze to achieve.<br /><br />*Why work for us?*<br />Nub is a new startup, the plan is to grow and become something every developer wants to use and every company choses to use...   The CEO has a proven track record in this field and a forensic knowledge of the current technology and a clear vision of its potential. <br /><br />You’ll get to work from home and help define our culture as the company grows.  The plan is for a London office when the time is right.  The CEO has a family, likes coffee, tech, would love a dog, used to race cars and loves sport.<br /><br />You may want to exit the corporate world and enter into an exciting journey with an early stage startup.  You may be bored of coding to someone else's spec, getting stuck in meetings and not being able to be creative with your code.  Work at Nub and that will change.<br />Perhaps you are a brilliant coder looking for a great idea – this is it!",

You can see our work at <a href='https://www.omgyes.com' rel='nofollow'>OMGYES.com</a></p><p>We get a huge amount of positive feedback from the press all over the world, and foremost from our users, who tell us how much it has helped their relationships and sex lives. It's been a wonderful, fulfilling journey.</p><p>What we need you to do<br>----------------------------<br>We're always working to keep our busy website (13m req/day) highly available, with minimal latency. We need you to design and implement new features that can scale accordingly. You will be making architectural decisions regarding data storage (database, NoSQL, client-side), content delivery (especially video across a wide range of devices), and gaining user insights through analytics.</p><p>Our users are distributed globally; we need to ensure we can serve a media-rich site in many languages to people all over the world. We need to support purchasing in a range of currencies, using different payment methods, with a careful eye to security.</p><p>Our backend was designed before launch. While it performs quite well, our site has evolved quite a bit since those days. We also have a new season of content that is in production. We've started a new project to build a more appropriate system, starting with season two content, and we want you to work with our front-end team to develop it, using modern best practices.</p><p>Who we're looking for<br>---------------------<br>You are completely at home in a server environment; both in the codebase and in the database. When someone proposes a new site feature, you've already assessed its impact on performance, designed a database schema, and half-architected the solution by the time they finish their pitch. As a full-stack developer, your emphasis is on the backend. You know the ins and outs of OWASP. You believe that design begins with data modeling, and your goal is instant gratification for all consumers of your APIs.</p><p>And, you are a scientist. You measure everything and make that data accessible, so you can make good decisions. You can frame improvements in terms of hypothesis and result, rather than conjecture.</p><p>You have more than 5 years of industry experience.</p><p>Technologies you should know<br>----------------------------<br>(In approximate order of importance, descending, not comprehensive!)</p><p>- MySQL / PostgreSQL<br>- Java (Spring Boot)<br>- Python / Ruby / Node.js (and your favorite web frameworks in each)<br>- Couchbase / Redis<br>- Varnish (and general principles of caching)<br>- AWS S3, EC2, Cloudfront (especially signed URLs)<br>- RESTful API design<br>- Git Flow<br>- Elasticsearch / Kibana / Logstash (self-hosted)<br>- Linux command line<br>- Video content delivery</p><p>Interested?<br>-----------<br>Send us your resume and a few words about why our project in particular interests you.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>(Included in job description)</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About OMGYes            </h2>            <div><p>OMGYes conducts large-scale scientific research into taboo topics like sexual pleasure.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you.

We’re excited to add a new Senior Full Stack Engineer to our team, but not just any engineer.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>We're looking for that someone special (yes, we're hoping that's you... keep reading to see </span><span></span><span>).</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Someone that shares our same vision. Someone that is willing to join us on our journey to change the way that businesses communicate, market, and sell online. Someone that is process-oriented and driven by seeing customers succeed.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>As a young start up (we're just coming up to our one year anniversary), we have tons of amazing users and are adding new great companies every single month.&nbsp; <b>A wonderful product experience is our primary focus here at Demio</b>... from the customer support, to the onboarding process, to the platform itself, we're working to hard to make it all a delightful experience. While the webinar, web-communication space has been around for a while and continues to grow, we believe that we’re creating an entirely new segment in the market and doing it in a simple way.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Demio is a simple but incredibly powerful webinar platform built for SaaS and Software companies</b>.&nbsp;With our platform, companies can generate leads, filter prospects, perform group demos, engaging sales presentations, integrate with their CRM, view advanced webinar reporting, track conversions, and more.

Your work will never go unnoticed. Your work will&nbsp;<b>ALWAYS</b>&nbsp;make large waves in the company.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>By joining now, you’ll be able to get in early on our company (But also the fun challenging product objectives) and help make some of the features/updates that will ultimately shape our product perfectly for our customers.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>We have a philosophy for our company that revolves around our team:&nbsp;<b>we ONLY work with A-Players</b>. A-Players, in our opinion, are people who cannot accept anything that is less than great.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>You’ll be able to work with a passionate, intelligent, and dedicated group of people that will allow you take your skills to the next level. You’ll always be challenged to be the best that you can be.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>But hey, we also like to have fun too </span><span></span><span>; we understand that building a company is quite the journey, and it can be incredibly hard, so we believe that it’s important to enjoy the moments along the way</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Skills and Requirements</b></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>What are we looking for from you? Well here’s a short list, but it will always be growing:<br></span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Developing scalable and reliable backend applications for our live webinar collaboration platform.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Excellent communication/english skills and ability to work well with remote teams (excellent verbal and written english skills)</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Follows coding best practices and develops appropriate testing and deployment scripts.</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><span>    </span>▪<span>    </span>Monitors and develops standards for platform load/usage with recommendations for improving performance.

Communication is always key here in a fast moving company!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Log into Trello and Github, review the sprint for that week and what the next tickets in that sprint on deck are. You can check in with our Director or Engineering to organize any priorities or make sure that your product story is being done right in regards to long-term scalability. You’ll want to commit those branches to Github and then launch them live on our Staging environment. <br></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Our QA lead can then head over and test the ticket in staging and make sure things are looking good. Move that ticket over, once approved, and we’re on to the next big win!</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>We're here to help our users as well, so that means sometimes taking a look at customer tickets coming in on priority and get those bug fixes moving quickly. Some days we’ll work on priority bugs and others on new tickets! (Most days a combination of both </span><span></span><span>.)</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>It'll be important that you keep communication with the team, QA, and support on what’s going on and where!</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Then, you can high five your teammates again when you log off and update the team in Slack with your daily update!<span>&nbsp;</span></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Once a week, we'll review the sprint, goals, and any major issues plus we’ll meet month to look where to improve for better internal systems across the company.
