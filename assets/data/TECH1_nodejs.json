Every month, more than 250,000&nbsp;volunteer editors contribute to Wikipedia. Based in San Francisco, California, the Wikimedia Foundation is an audited, 501(c)(3) non-profit that is funded primarily through donations and grants. It currently employs over 300&nbsp;staff members.</p><p>At the Foundation, we build technology to help people everywhere access Wikipedia, across devices and in nearly 300 languages. We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia. Roughly a quarter of our budget goes to supporting the community that make the site possible, including through&nbsp;grantmaking programs&nbsp;that enable volunteers and enrich the information on the sites.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage people with a diverse range of backgrounds to apply.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully paid premiums for medical, dental &amp; vision insurance premiums                            </div>                            <div>                                 401(k) with 4% matching contribution                            </div>                            <div>                                 7-12 weeks parental leave with 100% pay + lactation room                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wellness Program ($1800 annual) to promote wellness &amp; personal growth                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pre-tax savings plans for Transportation &amp; Parking                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible work schedules and remote working options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pet Friendly office                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commitment to diversity &amp; inclusion throughout the employee lifecycle                            </div>                            <div>                                 12 days vacation, 19 days holiday, 2 days volunteer work and more!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Lean more at https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Work_with_us                            </div>                    ",

Patients on our service receive presorted medication trays filled by a pharmacy that insert into a smart pillbox that can sense when patients forget a dose and sends an automated text, phone, email, or on-box reminder to patients and their caregivers. Our health coaches will follow up and call patients who are continually nonadherent. We also provide software for caregivers so that they have peace of mind that their loved ones are taking their medication properly. In a clinical study run by Penn Medicine and Independence Blue Cross, we increased medication adherence from 70% to 99%. </p><p>We currently sell to health insurance companies and hospital systems so that patients receive it for free. Our patients love us because we take away the complexity of managing medications and our customers love us because we keep patients healthy and out of the hospital--only 33% of patients take their medication as prescribed and 125,000 people die each year because of medication related errors. We are currently working with the largest health insurance companies in the country and are poised to scale to over 25,000 patients in the next 2 years. We’re on a mission to help patients and revolutionize the way that medications are taken in home. </p><p>To apply, please include a short description of your background and what you're looking for. Tell us a little about your favorite projects, and provide links to any you think might be relevant.</p><p>Responsibilities<br>- Create powerful internal tooling to help the TVH operations team deliver seamless medication management to patients<br>- Create innovative healthcare experiences for patients delivered through not only web applications, but creative use of messaging channels<br>- Partner with our operations and business development teams to create new services to help patients/caregivers manage medications<br>- Develop and maintain services using a modern web stack (e.g., Node.js, GraphQL, Postgres)<br>- Assist in deployment and maintenance of a Kubernetes cluster<br>- Evaluate, design, and implement new features to provide more enjoyable experiences for our users. </p><p>Systems we’ve worked on<br>- IoT backend processing sensor data to help identify patients who need care<br>- Microservice backend platform to manage data from multiple client web applications<br>- Automated notification system to coordinate online and pillbox-centric alerts for patients</p><p>Ideal<br>- Built db-backed GraphQL APIs for commercial projects (Python/Django = awesome, but also relevant if it was in Java, Scala, Ruby, Go, etc.)</p><p>About you</p><p>- You have a passion for helping patients and solving a real world problem <br>- You are confident, hungry, and self-motivated.<br>- You have 2+ years developing production web applications. <br>- You care deeply about quality of code and quality of experience<br>- You have curiosity and passion to work with operations and business development teams <br>- You are interested in making an impact at a startup and growing with our company.</p></div>",

Here's a partial list of the technologies we use every day: Choo, Nanocomponent, Codemirror, Bankai, Take-Five, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, CommonJS, and Node (6, moving to 8). You don't have to know all of those cold, even our CTO picked up (or&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/scriptoLLC/take-five' rel='nofollow'>created</a>!) some of them here at Scripto. What we'd like to see from you is 3-5 years of production JS experience, with a record of shipping software and learning on the fly. You should easily be able to point to complete projects you've devised and built, like features of a large package, or whole apps if they’re on the smaller side. Your work doesn't have to be open-source or public, but it should have real users and stakes.</p><p>We are a proudly remote company with flexible hours and health, dental, and vision benefits.

Advise and support the team so that they can take on less critical releases on a day-to-day basis.</li><li>Continually integrate the QA team and testing engineers into both the requirements gathering and software development processes and report status to clients on a very frequent basis.</li></ul><p>This is a remote position but is only open to candidates living in the US or Canada.

Interested in helping build the tool that powers automation for millions of professionals? Then read on…</p><br><p><strong>About You</strong></p><br><p>You are a skilled engineer. You've got a strong background working in our stack (React, ES6, Node.js, etc.) – even if you aren't a daily coder, you regularly exercise your coding muscles and try to be an asset on any technical context your team may need.</p><br><p>You are an effective team builder. This isn't your first rodeo. You know how to hire, train, and develop engineers from all backgrounds. You understand the benefits of building a diverse and inclusive engineering team. You may not have hired or managed hundreds of people before, but you have hired, trained, and managed at least a few engineers before.</p><br><p>You're adaptable.&nbsp;You've been in fast growing companies and know how to build, change, and adapt to the needs of a company as it grows.</p><br><p>You have excellent communication skills. You regularly work with engineers and other stakeholders from various disciplines, balancing engineering concerns, such as technical debt, with product concerns. Ideally, you find solutions that address both the team and user needs but if not, help build understanding around difficult decisions.</p><br><p>You can keep track of, prioritize, and lead multiple projects.&nbsp;We're a small team, and there's no shortage of things you could be doing in a day. You'll carve out time for functional projects and make sure they solve real problems the team faces – ideally making development even easier.</p><br><p><strong>Things You Might Do</strong></p><br><p>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:</p><br><ul><br><li>Develop effective ways to communicate, monitor, and lead your team through weekly one-on-one’s and team meetings.</li><br><li>Keep the leadership team informed on your team’s progress in ways that are easy and enjoyable to receive, like one-on-one's, update posts, and regular team hangouts.</li><br><li>Build rapport with each member of the Front End Engineering Team and support them through coaching and mentorship to help level up their skills.</li><br><li>Participate in code reviews, learning and spreading technical knowledge throughout Zapier – moving knowledge to documentation where appropriate.</li><br><li>Occasionally dive into the code; fixing bugs, improving developer experience, smoothing edges – sometimes even spiking out small proofs of concept.</li><br><li>Collaborate across various disciplines (Product Managers, Designers, Researchers) to help set technical roadmaps that will achieve business goals through engineering best practices.</li><br><li>Actively recruit, onboard, and train new engineers at Zapier. This might involve tweaking the skills portions of interviews, or writing better documentation.</li><br><li>As part of our&nbsp;<a href='https://zapier.com/learn/customer-support/everyone-on-support/' rel='nofollow'>All Hands Support</a>&nbsp;initiative, help customers have the best experience with Zapier as possible.</li><br></ul></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",
