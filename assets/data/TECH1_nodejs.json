We're Scripto, the software company that The New Yorker recently called &quot;<a href='https://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-scripto-the-app-that-stephen-colbert-helped-build-became-a-fixture-of-late-night-comedy-news' rel='nofollow'>a fixture of late-night comedy news</a>.&quot; It was a great start to the year, but we have even bigger plans, and we hope you'll apply to join us as a Developer. You'll be working on Showrunner, our next-generation product for screenwriters, sketch groups, sitcoms, and films.</p><p>We're looking for someone who enjoys the challenge of connecting users to APIs in an elegant and friendly way; you should be excited at the prospect of architecting and then implementing new mission-critical features that play well with our existing systems. Here's a partial list of the technologies we use every day: Choo, Nanocomponent, Codemirror, Bankai, Take-Five, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, CommonJS, and Node (6, moving to 8). You don't have to know all of those cold, even our CTO picked up (or&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/scriptoLLC/take-five' rel='nofollow'>created</a>!) some of them here at Scripto. What we'd like to see from you is 3-5 years of production JS experience, with a record of shipping software and learning on the fly. You should easily be able to point to complete projects you've devised and built, like features of a large package, or whole apps if they’re on the smaller side. Your work doesn't have to be open-source or public, but it should have real users and stakes.</p><p>We are a proudly remote company with flexible hours and health, dental, and vision benefits. We hire inclusively and value diversity. It should be noted, this position is only open to candidates in the USA. To apply, please&nbsp;submit a résumé and cover letter&nbsp;– we can't wait to hear from you.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Scripto            </h2>            <div><p>Scripto began in the early 2010s at the Colbert Report, when writer (and CEO) <a href='https://twitter.com/robdubbin' rel='nofollow'>Rob Dubbin</a> thought there&nbsp;should be a better way for the dozens of people who made&nbsp;the show every day to collaborate.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.<p>Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p>Technologies:</p><p>NodeJS / JavaScript</p><p>Babel / ES6</p><p>RDMS: MySQL / Postgres</p><p>Amazon Web Services: EC2, Lambda, CloudFront, S3</p><p>GitHub</p><p>Apache Aurora / Mesos</p><p>Terraform</p><p>Docker</p><p>We’re open to new technologies too, in the right situation.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode.

Interested in helping build the tool that powers automation for millions of professionals? Then read on…</p><br><p><strong>About You</strong></p><br><p>You are a skilled engineer. You've got a strong background working in our stack (React, ES6, Node.js, etc.) – even if you aren't a daily coder, you regularly exercise your coding muscles and try to be an asset on any technical context your team may need.</p><br><p>You are an effective team builder. This isn't your first rodeo. You know how to hire, train, and develop engineers from all backgrounds. You understand the benefits of building a diverse and inclusive engineering team. You may not have hired or managed hundreds of people before, but you have hired, trained, and managed at least a few engineers before.</p><br><p>You're adaptable.&nbsp;You've been in fast growing companies and know how to build, change, and adapt to the needs of a company as it grows.</p><br><p>You have excellent communication skills. You regularly work with engineers and other stakeholders from various disciplines, balancing engineering concerns, such as technical debt, with product concerns. Ideally, you find solutions that address both the team and user needs but if not, help build understanding around difficult decisions.</p><br><p>You can keep track of, prioritize, and lead multiple projects.&nbsp;We're a small team, and there's no shortage of things you could be doing in a day. You'll carve out time for functional projects and make sure they solve real problems the team faces – ideally making development even easier.</p><br><p><strong>Things You Might Do</strong></p><br><p>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:</p><br><ul><br><li>Develop effective ways to communicate, monitor, and lead your team through weekly one-on-one’s and team meetings.</li><br><li>Keep the leadership team informed on your team’s progress in ways that are easy and enjoyable to receive, like one-on-one's, update posts, and regular team hangouts.</li><br><li>Build rapport with each member of the Front End Engineering Team and support them through coaching and mentorship to help level up their skills.</li><br><li>Participate in code reviews, learning and spreading technical knowledge throughout Zapier – moving knowledge to documentation where appropriate.</li><br><li>Occasionally dive into the code; fixing bugs, improving developer experience, smoothing edges – sometimes even spiking out small proofs of concept.</li><br><li>Collaborate across various disciplines (Product Managers, Designers, Researchers) to help set technical roadmaps that will achieve business goals through engineering best practices.</li><br><li>Actively recruit, onboard, and train new engineers at Zapier. This might involve tweaking the skills portions of interviews, or writing better documentation.</li><br><li>As part of our&nbsp;<a href='https://zapier.com/learn/customer-support/everyone-on-support/' rel='nofollow'>All Hands Support</a>&nbsp;initiative, help customers have the best experience with Zapier as possible.</li><br></ul></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",
