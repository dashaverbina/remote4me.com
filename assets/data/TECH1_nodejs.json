But we’re even prouder of the fact that we’re a platform that serves developers, and we’re helping them build their own complex business process applications that require extensive forms and APIs to support them. No other platform provides developers the tools that we provide them.</p><p>We are growing rapidly, and have more work and opportunities than we have people to accomplish them. That’s where you come in!</p><p>If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have extensive experience with Javascript on *both* the front end and the back end. You’re excited about all the new technologies coming down the pike like typescript, angular 5, vue, ES2018 and are a super quick study. This isn’t your first rodeo. You’ve got 5 or more years of experience, and can point to multiple apps or sites you have helped ship.</p><p>That’s a really quick intro of what we are looking for but first you need to know what it is like working for us.</p><h5>A little about us</h5><p>We’re an early-stage company that provides our customers a powerful and unique combined Form and API platform designed specifically for developers!We have something that no-one else has, and we’ve achieved significant traction in the market and adoption byenterprises all over the world, ranging from startups, SMBs, to large enterprises, who operate in a wide range of business verticals including healthcare, education, government agencies, insurance, banking and financial services, legal, online retail, industrial, compliance, agricultural, software agencies, and many others. We are fully funded, have been cash flow positive for a while, and are rapidly growing our MRR revenue without needing to search for new investment capital.</p><p>We love building tools that make data collection and management easier for developers building web apps. As part of that we’ve developed tons of front end and back end components and tools in many frameworks and technologies.</p><h5>Who you’d be working with</h5><p>Our team is is small, tightly knit, and highly collaborative group of contributors. We are headquartered in Dallas, TX, but we have several remote developers as well, and we work very well over remote by utilizing conference and chatroom tools.</p><p><strong>Travis</strong> - the founding father and CTO of Form.io leads the team with technology insight and vision, combined with the powerful ability to roll up his sleeves and dive deep into the code with any issue. Travis is known within the company, and by our customers, for solving insanely complex problems over a weekend that would take a normal developer a month. Travis has a strong presence and following in the developer community, and much of his work can be found on Github and YouTube. Travis spends his free time with his wife and kids.</p><p><strong>Randall</strong> - our Lead Architect and sometimes described as “The most interesting developer in the world” due to his extensive worldwide traveling, and his tendency to tell crazy stories. . When not doing home improvement work on his house, or going to his daughters’ ballet classes, he’s resolving conflicting bug fixes and designing our next generation platform. If you have a problem, Randall can solve it, just don't get him started telling a story or you'll never get away.</p><p>And the rest of our extremely talented team including Gary Denise , Angel, Jeriah, Robert, Edwin, Rakesh, Yury and Alena.</p><h5>How you’ll work at Form.io</h5><p>We’re a group of dedicated and talented people - the kind you’d be excited to work with. Here’s what that looks like.</p><p><strong>Live where you want</strong> - We’re mostly located in the Dallas area but we do have very productive members of our team elsewhere. We all work from home a portion of the time, so we’re very good at using tools that enable remote work. Due to market demands and activities, and time zone overlaps we're currently looking specifically for new team members in the US and also in Australia, (but of course we’re also open to attracting exceptional talent from other regions too!)</p><p><strong>No crazy hours</strong> - We’re a startup but we realize that overworking our developers doesn’t make the process faster or better. We’re more interested in you developing great code and solving problems than working crazy hours.</p><p><strong>We’re all adults</strong> - There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor. We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit in front of a computer.</p><p><strong>World class tools</strong> - We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer (probably a mac) and replace it every three years.</p><p><strong>Solve important problems</strong> - We’re constantly doing hard things that are fun and helping companies work. We spend a lot of time designing new systems and solutioning problems for our customers.</p><p><strong>Learn new things</strong> - We’re built on latest generation technology and are always on the lookout for what’s new. Be prepared to constantly be learning promising new technologies and figuring out how they can make our company better.</p><p><strong>Testing is not a dirty word</strong> - We believe in automated testing. Bug fixes as well as new features should come with automated tests to ensure they work and make sure they don’t break in the future.</p><h5>Now, back to you, our new Javascript Developer…</h5><p>You’re a javascript developer with over 5 years of experience. You’ve done work with both the frontend (angular, react, vue, etc) and the backend (nodejs). You understand what makes javascript javascript with concepts like asynchronous functions, promises, scoping and prototypical inheritance. You also stay on top of the latest ES6 features like classes, arrow functions, destructuring and typescript. You know how to write east-to-maintain code, documentation while getting things done under pressure.</p><p>You’ll help us continue building out our platform, client apps and develop new functionality. There are always a ton of new client requests coming in as well as helping them set up their projects and learn how to build with our tools. In addition, there are the new features and functionality. We have a roadmap full of exciting new features such as form workflow, payment gateways, 3rd party platform integrations, and new framework support.</p><p>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer who doesn’t write only so that the computer can understand your code, but also so other developers can understand it too.</li><li>Are a fast learner of new technologies and keep on top of new trends.</li><li>Are a top notch debugger. You can find problems quickly and understand how to fix them without breaking other functionality.</li><li>Are self motivated and take responsibility for fixing problems like:<ul><li>“The form is too slow if you configure it like …”</li><li>&quot;Add paypal integration to this app”</li><li>&quot;We need to allow international versions of the phone field”</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple frameworks with different technologies.</li><li>Have experience with<ul><li>React/Vue/Angular/AngularJS</li><li>Nodejs/Express</li><li>Mongodb</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES2015/Typescript</li></ul></li><li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one app in one of the above frameworks.</li><li>Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li><li><strong>Bonus</strong> - You already use form.io!</li></ul><p><em>Form.io is an equal opportunity employer. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to build and expand a smart, hard-working team that loves working together to build something exciting and relevant.</em></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack developer that can build features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile), challenge our thinking on architecture and lead a high-performing team.</p><p><strong>About you </strong></p><p>We’re excited to tell you about Aula and what we’re working on, but first of all, let us explain who we’re looking for. The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>You have experience leading a team of developers (remote is ideal!)</li><li>You have both front-end <em>and</em> back-end experience</li><li>You have experience with React - unless you have significant Javascript experience with other libraries so that you’ll be able to pick it up quickly</li><li>You have experience creating and iterating on products from end-to-end: we think there are certain things that freelance and agency work doesn’t teach you such as working end-to-end (full feature) on an entire system.</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>About us </strong></p><p>Aula is a conversational platform for education. Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.</p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and <a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement.</p><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a> with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d <a href='https://cl.ly/2i0V3z453H2K' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>this blog post</a>, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack developer that can build features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile) and challenge our thinking on architecture. Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Pushing our thinking on core architecture choices</li><li>Be part of leading a high-performing team: inspiring team members, set priorities and own results</li><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Interview process <br></strong>Interview processes&nbsp;don’t need to be scary and stressful for us to be able to pick out those of you that would fit in the best at Aula. The first three stages all take place asynchronously in a dedicated Slack channel filled with other curious and smart candidates - it’s turned out to be <a href='https://cl.ly/1P1P2i0k1320' rel='nofollow'>quite a community</a>. You’ll chat with Oliver about your experience and your thoughts particular topics. You’ll then receive a (~5 hour) test to complete over the course of 48 hours - on the weekend if you’d like. Then you get to meet the team on video conference. If both parties feel comfortable, we’ll then give you an offer to join us. The whole process takes place over the course of around 10 days, in your own time.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role.

We are pushing the envelope for what our industry has seen in regard to customer experience and service. This position is for someone more skilled in Javascript (Node/Angular/React/Meteor) than .Net languages. Our tech team&nbsp;gets to choose the&nbsp;stack so&nbsp;open source languages such Ruby, Go, Erlang are a possibility for the right task.</p><h3>The technologies we use:</h3><ul><li><h4>Node.js, React, Meteor, GraphQL(Apollo)&nbsp;← This is what we're hiring for</h4></li><li>ASP VB.Net (legacy apps being supported while we retire them)</li><li>VB.Net Soap Services (legacy SOA tier being supported while we retire them)</li><li>C# WebAPI using EF, StructureMap (New Restful API)</li><li>SQL Server, Redis and Memcached (Data storage and caching)</li><li>Anything new that looks cool, sexy and can solve a need</li></ul><h3><span>Examples of existing projects and opportunities include:</span></h3><ul><li><span>Data-rich/responsive website for our customers with stats, schedules, standings, player profiles and social-media driven content</span></li><li><span>Opportunities to learn and use platforms like React/Node.js, Cordova/PhoneGap and XCode/Swift to develop and deliver mobile apps</span></li><li><span>Custom solutions for our International Tournaments held in Las Vegas (The World’s Largest according to Guinness World Records)</span></li><li><span>Electronic scoring and payment systems to take full advantage of the mobile-revolution</span></li><li><span>Work together with our back-end team to help add value to the support of our existing projects and make them shine</span></li></ul><h3><span>Key Responsibilities:</span></h3><ul><li><span>Have fun and work hard</span></li><li><span>Work closely with in-house team of Creative and Operational leaders to craft solutions and bring amazing ideas to fruition</span></li><li><span>Solve problems and deliver solutions with speed and grace</span></li><li>Be a team player and work on whatever project needs you (We are a small team where egos are not tolerated)</li></ul><h2><span>About You:</span></h2><p><span>You've been a software developer for a handful of years but what's really important to us is what you've learned and what you've done.

However, you understand when to call for help, when to ditch an idea and pivot to something different. You know when to push back on a requirement and ask for more clarity. You stay current on tech. You love what you do and are passionate about creating great software (or at least you dream of being on a team that wants you to do so). You may have a Comp Sci degree, but you may just have stumbled into software development and found that you had a knack for it. You know your craft and you may have even squealed a little inside when the word &quot;craft&quot; was used to describe software development. You have worked on an Agile Development team before and understand Sprints, User Stories, and Story Point estimation. If not, you just googled &quot;Agile Development&quot; to learn more because that's just who you are.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>You have experience with some of the following (listed in order of importance):</span></p><ul><li>Building applications with React or a similar Javascript framework</li><li><span>Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3 and LESS, SASS, JCSS, etc.</span></li><li><span>Responsive web development experience - CSS media queries and JavaScript device detection</span></li><li><span>Production application experience with Cordova (we currently use Meteor and it's Cordova integration) and/or Electron</span></li><li><span>Working knowledge of Version Control such as Git or Mercurial</span></li><li><span>Experience with VB.Net, C#, MVC and/or ASP.Net (our API is C# WebAPI and legacy apps are in VB.Net)</span></li><li><span>Knowledgeable in Google Analytics/Google Tag Manager/Google Webmaster Tools a plus</span></li><li><span>Knowledgeable in WordPress/PHP a plus</span></li></ul><h2><span>Perks of working for APA:</span></h2><ul><li>You get your choice of computing hardware (Mac, PC, Laptop or Desktop, the choice is yours) and two or three massive 27&quot; monitors to go with it</li><li>We close our offices between Christmas and New Years</li><li>401k with a healthy company match (after 1 year)</li><li>Competitive health insurance options (after 90 days)</li><li>We have a flexible work from home accommodation for our St. Louis based employees</li><li><span>Paid time off</span></li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

Patients on our service receive presorted medication trays filled by a pharmacy that insert into a smart pillbox that can sense when patients forget a dose and sends an automated text, phone, email, or on-box reminder to patients and their caregivers. Our health coaches will follow up and call patients who are continually nonadherent. We also provide software for caregivers so that they have peace of mind that their loved ones are taking their medication properly. In a clinical study run by Penn Medicine and Independence Blue Cross, we increased medication adherence from 70% to 99%. </p><p>We currently sell to health insurance companies and hospital systems so that patients receive it for free. Our patients love us because we take away the complexity of managing medications and our customers love us because we keep patients healthy and out of the hospital--only 33% of patients take their medication as prescribed and 125,000 people die each year because of medication related errors. We are currently working with the largest health insurance companies in the country and are poised to scale to over 25,000 patients in the next 2 years. We’re on a mission to help patients and revolutionize the way that medications are taken in home. </p><p>To apply, please include a short description of your background and what you're looking for. Tell us a little about your favorite projects, and provide links to any you think might be relevant.</p><p>Responsibilities<br>- Create powerful internal tooling to help the TVH operations team deliver seamless medication management to patients<br>- Create innovative healthcare experiences for patients delivered through not only web applications, but creative use of messaging channels<br>- Partner with our operations and business development teams to create new services to help patients/caregivers manage medications<br>- Develop and maintain services using a modern web stack (e.g., Node.js, GraphQL, Postgres)<br>- Assist in deployment and maintenance of a Kubernetes cluster<br>- Evaluate, design, and implement new features to provide more enjoyable experiences for our users. </p><p>Systems we’ve worked on<br>- IoT backend processing sensor data to help identify patients who need care<br>- Microservice backend platform to manage data from multiple client web applications<br>- Automated notification system to coordinate online and pillbox-centric alerts for patients</p><p>Ideal<br>- Built db-backed GraphQL APIs for commercial projects (Python/Django = awesome, but also relevant if it was in Java, Scala, Ruby, Go, etc.)</p><p>About you</p><p>- You have a passion for helping patients and solving a real world problem <br>- You are confident, hungry, and self-motivated.<br>- You have 2+ years developing production web applications. <br>- You care deeply about quality of code and quality of experience<br>- You have curiosity and passion to work with operations and business development teams <br>- You are interested in making an impact at a startup and growing with our company.</p></div>",
