The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly.

We’ve built Aula because we believe digital infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.</p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and <a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement.</p><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a> with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d <a href='https://cl.ly/2i0V3z453H2K' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>this blog post</a>, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack developer that can build features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile) and challenge our thinking on architecture. Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Pushing our thinking on core architecture choices</li><li>Be part of leading a high-performing team: inspiring team members, set priorities and own results</li><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Interview process <br></strong>Interview processes&nbsp;don’t need to be scary and stressful for us to be able to pick out those of you that would fit in the best at Aula. The first three stages all take place asynchronously in a dedicated Slack channel filled with other curious and smart candidates - it’s turned out to be <a href='https://cl.ly/1P1P2i0k1320' rel='nofollow'>quite a community</a>. You’ll chat with Oliver about your experience and your thoughts particular topics. You’ll then receive a (~5 hour) test to complete over the course of 48 hours - on the weekend if you’d like. Then you get to meet the team on video conference. If both parties feel comfortable, we’ll then give you an offer to join us. The whole process takes place over the course of around 10 days, in your own time.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role.

Patients on our service receive presorted medication trays filled by a pharmacy that insert into a smart pillbox that can sense when patients forget a dose and sends an automated text, phone, email, or on-box reminder to patients and their caregivers. Our health coaches will follow up and call patients who are continually nonadherent. We also provide software for caregivers so that they have peace of mind that their loved ones are taking their medication properly. In a clinical study run by Penn Medicine and Independence Blue Cross, we increased medication adherence from 70% to 99%. </p><p>We currently sell to health insurance companies and hospital systems so that patients receive it for free. Our patients love us because we take away the complexity of managing medications and our customers love us because we keep patients healthy and out of the hospital--only 33% of patients take their medication as prescribed and 125,000 people die each year because of medication related errors. We are currently working with the largest health insurance companies in the country and are poised to scale to over 25,000 patients in the next 2 years. We’re on a mission to help patients and revolutionize the way that medications are taken in home. </p><p>To apply, please include a short description of your background and what you're looking for. Tell us a little about your favorite projects, and provide links to any you think might be relevant.</p><p>Responsibilities<br>- Create powerful internal tooling to help the TVH operations team deliver seamless medication management to patients<br>- Create innovative healthcare experiences for patients delivered through not only web applications, but creative use of messaging channels<br>- Partner with our operations and business development teams to create new services to help patients/caregivers manage medications<br>- Develop and maintain services using a modern web stack (e.g., Node.js, GraphQL, Postgres)<br>- Assist in deployment and maintenance of a Kubernetes cluster<br>- Evaluate, design, and implement new features to provide more enjoyable experiences for our users. </p><p>Systems we’ve worked on<br>- IoT backend processing sensor data to help identify patients who need care<br>- Microservice backend platform to manage data from multiple client web applications<br>- Automated notification system to coordinate online and pillbox-centric alerts for patients</p><p>Ideal<br>- Built db-backed GraphQL APIs for commercial projects (Python/Django = awesome, but also relevant if it was in Java, Scala, Ruby, Go, etc.)</p><p>About you</p><p>- You have a passion for helping patients and solving a real world problem <br>- You are confident, hungry, and self-motivated.<br>- You have 2+ years developing production web applications. <br>- You care deeply about quality of code and quality of experience<br>- You have curiosity and passion to work with operations and business development teams <br>- You are interested in making an impact at a startup and growing with our company.</p></div>",

Here's a partial list of the technologies we use every day: Choo, Nanocomponent, Codemirror, Bankai, Take-Five, Postgres, Redis, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, CommonJS, and Node (6, moving to 8).

Your work doesn't have to be open-source or public, but it should have real users and stakes.</p><p>We are a proudly remote company with flexible hours and health, dental, and vision benefits.
