Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developers who want to add to Kibana and X-Pack?

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects and have a long term vision to build a stand-alone product in about a year. The future product will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.</p><p>Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p>Technologies:</p><p>NodeJS / JavaScript</p><p>Babel / ES6</p><p>RDMS: MySQL / Postgres</p><p>Amazon Web Services: EC2, Lambda, CloudFront, S3</p><p>GitHub</p><p>Apache Aurora / Mesos</p><p>Terraform</p><p>Docker</p><p>We’re open to new technologies too, in the right situation.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

How about branching out to VR and AR? Do you like to work in a fast-paced environment with a fantastic product team? Do you feel like your current job is just a job and you have to fight for flexible hours, ability to work from home, and your innovation time is reduced to an occasional hackathon? Are you tired of various business stakeholders treating you like a waiter in a fast-food restaurant? If the answer is yes, then read on and hit that 'Apply Now' button, because we are different!<br /><br />At Concrete we work hard to create a perfect environment for our engineers. We don't have a Michelin star chef to serve your lunch but we do have an established working from home policy so you can spend more time with your family. We also don't have a barista on-site to serve your almond milk latte, but we are flexible - you can start your day in the office at any time providing you make it for our daily standup (because it is important! and yes, we do have a very good coffee machine).<br /><br />This time we are looking for a Senior Fullstack engineer to take ownership and guide our multi-skilled development team. You will be working alongside management and the backend lead to deliver applications for a new retail platform using the very latest JavaScript technologies and Frameworks.<br /><br />We are constantly building new applications for our clients - Marks and Spencer, GAP and many more. Working on a real-time collaboration software is challenging - you will have to learn new technologies and prototype new apps at a speed of light, but not because it is a high-pressure environment, simply because you like to see your code working in production. That said, we don't tolerate sloppy coding - for every single line of code we write, there is almost always a line of unit-testing code.<br /><br />If you're a frontend lead right now or a driven senior engineer with a burning desire for a career progression and a skillset to match - get in touch!<br /><br />Skills &amp; Requirements<br /><br />Must have<br />* Strong experience developing web apps and mobile-first websites<br />* 5+ years experience in development using modern stacks / frameworks / technologies<br />* An expert understanding of Javascript (ES6) <br />* Experience with OO and MVC design patterns<br />* Understanding of functional programming<br />* Solid experience with React/Redux/Redux-saga<br />* Solid experience with Node.js<br />* Knowledge of when and how to apply design patterns<br />* Good grasp of functional programming and SOLID principles<br />* TDD/Unit testing<br />* Clean code is your second nature<br />* Experience with testing frameworks such as jest, mocha, chai etc...<br />* Experience developing SaaS products<br />* Previous experience of managing, mentoring and coaching teams of engineers<br />* Worked previously in an international environment<br />* Links to existing work or projects on Git<br />* Experience with AWS<br /><br />Nice to have<br />* Other programming languages (Go, Rust)<br />* Experience designing APIs from scratch<br />* Kubernetes/Docker<br />* Exposure to event-sourcing architecture<br />* Experience with CQRS",

We’re looking for someone who loves talking to people as much as they love web development.<br><br>We are an early stage, venture-backed, startup that already has a product our customers love and pay for. We need someone who is willing to roll up their sleeves and be an integral part of our growth. We are a small team and this is a key role. This position will juggle multiple responsibilities including supporting customers, getting into the code to fix their issues, and developing features that prevent those issues from happening again. You are a responsive communicator, savvy problem-solver, pay attention to detail, and have the ability to drive multiple projects simultaneously.<br><br>You will be working with a small but supportive team of senior developers with a combined 40 years of experience. We are big believers in code reviews, code quality, and active learning. You will have ownership and get a chance to make an impactful contributing to our product with the full support of our team.<br><br><strong>Here's what a typical scenario looks like:</strong><br><br></p><ul><li>A customer reaches out via Intercom because something on their account isn't configured correctly. <br></li><li>You respond quickly that you're looking into it. <br></li><li>You discover that the misconfiguration isn't something that can be fixed in our admin panel, so you dive into the Rails console to fix it for them. <br></li><li>You respond to them to let then know you've fixed it, and they shower you in appreciation. <br></li><li>You then decide to add that functionality to the admin panel so you jump into the code and create a pull-request. <br></li><li>Your PR gets reviewed and you ship it to production.<br><br>To some people, that sounds boring. To others, that sounds like a great way to have an impact and face new challenges every day. Ideally you're the latter type of person.<br><br><strong>Speaking of ideals, we would love it if you:</strong><br><br></li><li>Have experience working in retail so that you understand where our customers are coming from. <br></li><li>Are a good writer and can clearly express your ideas in writing. <br></li><li>Have a bias for getting things done and making customers happy.<br></li><li>Have a tendency to think proactively instead of just reactively. <br></li><li>Can manage your own schedule and are responsible with your time.<br><br>----<br><br>Oh, we forgot to mention, we're a remote company with a team spread out all over the world. A number of us are in Vancouver and San Francisco, but there is no office. Instead, we give you the flexibility to work from wherever you'd like as long as you can be available during reasonable North American customer support hours. We have twice-annual offsites at fun locations. Our last one was in Whislter, and the one before that was in Costa Rica.</li></ul></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

No one wants to spread themselves too thinly and that is why we have carefully selected our few core technologies but we are not afraid of trying anything new that may be right for the job.  If you agree with this then read on, it should hopefully mean that you are someone that likes to self improve.<br />This role is to be the first tech hire alongside Nub’s founder.  You will be a key hire and valued highly if you can work hard as a team towards the aims of the company.  Your judgement will be valued as we work towards engineering a unique multi-platform application with a web app based UI and a Go based back end.<br /><br />*About you:*<br />- You are a dedicated and resourceful engineer<br />- 2+ years of professional Full Stack Software Engineering Experience<br />- Proven experience of completing HTML/CSS/Javascript deliverables (web app development not brochure style websites)<br />- Competence in Go (Golang) but if you have experience delivering software with another language (such as Python) and are keen to learn Go that may work.<br />- Competence writing SQL<br />- Happy to work with Node.js, Electron, ES6, Babel, Webpack.<br />- Exposure to Vuejs or similar (e.g. react)<br />- You love staying on top of the latest developments in software development <br />- Must be authorized to work in the UK<br />- Happy to work from home but meet in London for regular meetings.<br /><br />*About Nub:*<br />Lego for written comms. Modular utility, ubiquity and unique accessibility.<br /><br />Nub makes sending beautiful and personalised emails, invoices, forms, itineraries, receipts etc as easy as building with lego.  Comprised of an engine and codeless tools to automate data capture, data manipulation and subsequent output primarily via email, pdf, print, data, or api.  Triggered by any system, language or data and achieved without the need to be a programmer.<br /><br />This kit will mean everyone can create cool customer communications on a new, automated, intuitive and scalable platform.  It will allow anyone to handle data transformation and create automated output such as print, pdf or email.  Have control over branding, designs customisation and personalisation.<br /><br />Developers will love this because it removes a complex distraction from their applications. Companies large and small will love this because it will allow custom communications from any system to their employees or clients.<br />Anyone looking to automate data transformation from one format to the other will love this because  they will find it a breeze to achieve.<br /><br />*Why work for us?*<br />Nub is a new startup, the plan is to grow and become something every developer wants to use and every company choses to use...   The CEO has a proven track record in this field and a forensic knowledge of the current technology and a clear vision of its potential. <br /><br />You’ll get to work from home and help define our culture as the company grows.  The plan is for a London office when the time is right.  The CEO has a family, likes coffee, tech, would love a dog, used to race cars and loves sport.<br /><br />You may want to exit the corporate world and enter into an exciting journey with an early stage startup.  You may be bored of coding to someone else's spec, getting stuck in meetings and not being able to be creative with your code.  Work at Nub and that will change.<br />Perhaps you are a brilliant coder looking for a great idea – this is it!",

Every month, more than 250,000 volunteer editors contribute to Wikipedia. Based in San Francisco, California, the Wikimedia Foundation is an audited, 501(c)(3) non-profit that is funded primarily through donations and grants. It currently employs over 300 staff members.</p><p>At the Foundation, we build technology to help people everywhere access Wikipedia, across devices and in nearly 300 languages. We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia. Roughly a quarter of our budget goes to supporting the community that&nbsp;make&nbsp;the site possible, including through&nbsp;grantmaking programs&nbsp;that enable volunteers and enrich the information on the sites.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage people with a diverse range of backgrounds to apply.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully paid premiums for medical, dental &amp; vision                            </div>                            <div>                                 401(k) Retirement Plan                            </div>                            <div>                                 Short and Long Term Disability Insurance                            </div>                            <div>                                 Life and AD&amp;D Insurance                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible Spending Transportation &amp; Parking Plan                            </div>                            <div>                                 Parental Support                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wellness Program ($1800/a year)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Employee Assistance Program (EAP)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible Spending Account Plan                            </div>                            <div>                                 Personal development/education                            </div>                    ",

Do you feel at home nurturing the success of dynamic, wold class engineers? Are you a top Software Engineering Managers who want to support and lead engineers on Kibana and X-Pack, robust tools which allow visual exploration, real-time data analysis in addition to other powerful features, all while working on core frontend applications? Than we want to meet you.</p><p>If you read this far and think, “that's me!” then you probably won't need to read any further and we should have a conversation.

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on absolutely anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong>What you will be doing:</strong></p><ul><li>Day to day management of 10-15 engineers</li><li>Hiring and recruiting of new staff</li><li>Performance management, reviews and quarterly feedback for the team</li><li>Expense management and approval</li><li>Vacation and time off management and approval</li><li>Project management and prioritization support for the team</li><li>Management of roadmaps and requirements against release targets</li></ul><p><strong>What you've done:</strong></p><ul><li>3+ years of software engineering management</li><li>Recent experience leading teams producing complex interactive web experiences</li><li>An engineering background with a B.S. or equivalent in a Software Engineering related domain</li><li>Experience leading distributed teams</li><li>Experience leading an open source product team</li><li>Familiarity with JavaScript and one or more UI framework: AngularJS, React, Node.js etc...</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Elastic            </h2>            <div><p>Elastic is the world's leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security, and analytics use cases.

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give craft to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more.

You can see our work at <a href='https://www.omgyes.com' rel='nofollow'>OMGYES.com</a></p><p>We get a huge amount of positive feedback from the press all over the world, and foremost from our users, who tell us how much it has helped their relationships and sex lives. It's been a wonderful, fulfilling journey.</p><p>What we need you to do<br>----------------------------<br>We're always working to keep our busy website (13m req/day) highly available, with minimal latency. We need you to design and implement new features that can scale accordingly. You will be making architectural decisions regarding data storage (database, NoSQL, client-side), content delivery (especially video across a wide range of devices), and gaining user insights through analytics.</p><p>Our users are distributed globally; we need to ensure we can serve a media-rich site in many languages to people all over the world. We need to support purchasing in a range of currencies, using different payment methods, with a careful eye to security.</p><p>Our backend was designed before launch. While it performs quite well, our site has evolved quite a bit since those days. We also have a new season of content that is in production. We've started a new project to build a more appropriate system, starting with season two content, and we want you to work with our front-end team to develop it, using modern best practices.</p><p>Who we're looking for<br>---------------------<br>You are completely at home in a server environment; both in the codebase and in the database. When someone proposes a new site feature, you've already assessed its impact on performance, designed a database schema, and half-architected the solution by the time they finish their pitch. As a full-stack developer, your emphasis is on the backend. You know the ins and outs of OWASP. You believe that design begins with data modeling, and your goal is instant gratification for all consumers of your APIs.</p><p>And, you are a scientist. You measure everything and make that data accessible, so you can make good decisions. You can frame improvements in terms of hypothesis and result, rather than conjecture.</p><p>You have more than 5 years of industry experience.</p><p>Technologies you should know<br>----------------------------<br>(In approximate order of importance, descending, not comprehensive!)</p><p>- MySQL / PostgreSQL<br>- Java (Spring Boot)<br>- Python / Ruby / Node.js (and your favorite web frameworks in each)<br>- Couchbase / Redis<br>- Varnish (and general principles of caching)<br>- AWS S3, EC2, Cloudfront (especially signed URLs)<br>- RESTful API design<br>- Git Flow<br>- Elasticsearch / Kibana / Logstash (self-hosted)<br>- Linux command line<br>- Video content delivery</p><p>Interested?<br>-----------<br>Send us your resume and a few words about why our project in particular interests you.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>(Included in job description)</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About OMGYes            </h2>            <div><p>OMGYes conducts large-scale scientific research into taboo topics like sexual pleasure.

We have the best technology, and the&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ably.io/about/team' rel='nofollow'>best people</a>&nbsp;in the industry. &nbsp;</p><p>Join us now and you'll be early in at a business going places, you'll learn a lot, you'll work with the founding team, and you'll have fun.\\<strong>What we want in return -- in brief</strong>\\We want someone smart, ambitious, curious and motivated. Someone is prepared to do their best and work their arse off to do great work and become outstanding at what they do.</p><p><strong>Job description</strong></p><p>You'll be working with a deeply technical engineering team who collectively bring a wealth of experience and broad technology skills. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites us each day and motivates us each. &nbsp;If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably. &nbsp;Our team is made up of a strong remote contingent, however our base is in London and growing. We are strong believers in face-to-face communication where possible. Whilst this is a remote working role, being able to practically travel to London occasionally is highly preferable and working on a similar time zone is a must.</p><p>Day to day you can expect to be working on:</p><ul><li>  The &quot;core&quot; realtime platform which is largely Node.js and Go. You will also be required to work on the various services and routing layers of the platform which are built in Go and Elixir (we would expect you to be comfortable in either Go or Elixir, both would be a big win). As an aside, we use Ruby for all infrastructure automation and orchestration and occasionally write lower-level native code where necessary (such as native modules for Node). We're always revisiting the technologies we use and are always open to using new technologies where suitable.</li><li>  Working within the realtime platform and solving distributed programming problems.</li><li>  Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.</li><li>  Diagnosing and fixing bugs in our platform using distributed tracing techniques.</li><li>  Adding suitable test coverage to new features as well as existing functionality, conducting load tests using our frameworks, and generally helping to address platform stability and regression prevention.</li><li>  Be responsible for the complete lifecycle of your features and code i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments with ownership of any issues that arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are strong believers in all developers being involved in the system operations as well.</li><li>  Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products. &nbsp;All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.</li><li>  Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.</li><li>  Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.</li><li>  Suggestions for new features or improvements to&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/' rel='nofollow'>our protocol and API specifications</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>  Salary range:&nbsp;€40k to €85k. Depends entirely on skills and experience.</li><li>  Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays. Can be negotiated.</li><li>  Benefit from a truly flexible working environment in which remote working and managing your own working time is the norm.</li><li>  Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about.&nbsp;</li><li>  Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.</li><li>  Work with genuinely nice people who care.\\</li></ul><h4>Requirements</h4><ul><li>  Experience: A minimum of a three years of professional experience in Node.js. Go and/or Elixir experience is very beneficial. You must have experience using both statically and dynamically typed languages, ideally in at least one other language. Any exposure to realtime and distributed systems is a real advantage. An understanding of Ruby is beneficial in regards to infrastructure automation and tooling, but not necessary.</li><li>  Pragmatic: A problem solver excited by the prospect of working autonomously solve problems and bring solutions to the team.</li><li>  Fast Learner: We're looking for software engineers who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies. &nbsp;Our stack is diverse, and we expect it to continue to grow.</li><li>  Testing: Experience using testing frameworks and adoption of test driven development where applicable.</li><li>  Infrastructure: Experience with infrastructure and distributed systems is beneficial.</li><li>  Communication: We use tools such as Slack throughout the day to communicate, however we believe in voice conversations to discuss and solve problems. You must be proficient in spoken and written English, be eager to collaborate with the engineering team and constructively welcome code reviews.</li><li>  Customers: Comfortable talking to customers and assisting them with their technical issues and integration.</li><li>  Open source:&nbsp;We prefer developers who have contributed back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small.</li></ul><h4>****** NO AGENCIES PLEASE ******</h4></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United Kingdom</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>EU only, preferred in the UK</p></dd>        </dl>",

We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future.Who you are: You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you.

The position reports to npm’s Vice President of Marketing in Oakland, California.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>You’re a creative, organized, and versatile generalist who will help keep the marketing machine humming. You’ll create and iterate on our marketing efforts, particularly advertising, email marketing, and our website funnel. Other moving parts include marketing automation, site optimization and analytics, blog and web content, search engine marketing, and ad tools.</p><p>We’re looking for prior experience in digital marketing, marketing operations, or marketing communications, but that’s not rigid. If you are curious, adaptable, and kind, you can get the hang of this. Other members of our marketing team have been an unsuccessful screenwriter and a bartender at a Cajun restaurant, and our CEO started his career selling vacuum cleaners. It takes all kinds.</p><p><strong>About npm</strong></p><p>npm is kind of a big deal. Over 9 million software developers worldwide use npm, Inc.’s open source software and web registry to discover, share, and reuse packages of code. Our users download over 550,000 packages more than 3 billion times per week, and registry downloads have grown by more than 16x in the last two years.</p><p>Our paid products and services offer teams and companies additional ways to organize, share, and secure code, integrate npm with testing and deployment tools, and bring code reuse into the enterprise. More than 100,000 companies, including BBC, DocuSign, Electronic Arts, Hyperloop One, Juniper Networks, Nvidia, Slack, and Visa, rely on npm to reduce friction and build amazing things.</p><p><strong>About working at npm</strong></p><p>npm is not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests who take both our careers and our lives seriously. The best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We focus on tools and sustainable processes rather than on individual heroics, and we value flexibility, continual process improvements, and scrappy problem solving.</p><p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California, but if you have experience working remotely, we are open to this. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p><p><strong><em>Closing date for applications is Friday, November 3, 2017</em></strong></p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",
