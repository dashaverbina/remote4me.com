We work very closely, collaborating across the company and teaching each other.</li><li>You will get to work with customers doing really cool things</li><li>You will feel invested in your work: We are highly internally transparent with business strategy, successes and failures, and management decisions. You will have a direct impact on success, and whether we achieve our goals.</li><li>You will help us build a business for the long term, investing in a sustainable business model and building trust with our customers through transparency and visibility</li><li>We are backed by excellent investors and have the resources we need to do a great job</li><li>Everyone gets to live in the place that suits them best.
