You will educate clients on our products and respond to tough (and not-so-tough) inquiries through email using Desk.com and on live chat using Intercom.io. You will also make the occasional phone call. Yep, you'll be responding to LOTS of people and putting smiles on their faces all day. That takes a certain kind of person. If that's you...read on.</p><h2>Our Ideal Candidate</h2><p><strong>Knows their stuff.</strong> This can't be your first rodeo. You have at least 2 years of experience in a web-based, service oriented company providing customer support where email and live chat were your primary responsibilities.</p><p><strong>Can read between the lines.</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes a client's question isn't always obvious, and I'm sure you know, a lot can get lost in 'email' translation. A client may be asking for one thing, and really need something else. You have an uncanny ability to read into what they are looking for, ask the right questions, and exceed their expectations by responding to their real question.</p><p><strong>Has great sleuthing skills.</strong> You are able to do your own detective work and find clues with the tools you have access to. You never pass on a case without first trying to piece the puzzle together.</p><p><strong>Is an exceptional communicator.</strong> You know how to get your message across clearly and concisely to different audiences, through the written word. You are a skilled writer and have outstanding proofreading skills. Yup, you're a natural here.</p><p><strong>Embraces sales.</strong>&nbsp;You understand that part of your role is to be a frontline salesperson and you see this as an important part of how you approach your work.</p><p><strong>Cares.</strong>&nbsp;You are an empathetic advocate for our clients. You recognize that through email, you are building relationships, making our customers feel cared for, and quickly solving problems if an experience doesn't go 100% as planned. You care about our clients having accurate information and are getting their issues resolved.</p><p><strong>Is thorough and obsessed with the details.</strong> You are careful, cautious, and incredibly meticulous; some may even call you nitpicky - in an endearing way, of course! And, you dream about dotting the i's and crossing the t's. Nothing slips by the net when you're goalie.</p><p><strong>Is comfortable with frequent pivots.</strong>&nbsp;You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a fast-changing environment - you understand that things change as new information is made available. You don't mind shifting gears and are skilled at having a few balls up in the air at one time.</p><p><strong>Is committed to their craft.</strong>&nbsp;You were meant to be in Client Care. It is your unique ability. <em>It's not a stepping stone to join PN or to gain some experience to launch another career</em>. You care about people and want to be sure they have everything they need to make the right decision for themselves and get their questions answered.</p><p><strong>Has the ability to work independently and can ramp up quickly, for more intense periods of work.</strong>&nbsp;Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don't need a lot of direction. That said, you are not on an island. You'll get plenty of help and support from the team when you need it and when it gets busy during launch periods and the team needs you - you'll jump right in.</p><p><strong>Leaves their ego at the door.</strong>&nbsp;You have integrity, talent, are outgoing, have a palpable excitement about the future, and don't show it off. Shadiness, mediocrity, cynicism, and excessive 'constructive criticism' are out.</p><p><strong>Wants to be part of a purpose-driven organization.</strong>&nbsp;PN is a pretty incredible place and is committed to allowing you to do the work you love and love the work you do.</p><p>Life-changing, research-driven nutrition coaching. That's our mission at Precision Nutrition.</p><p>As an organization, we:</p><ul><li>Seek and support diversity.</li><li>Offer 4 weeks paid time-off, benefits, and the ability to work remotely.</li><li>Set you up with whatever fancy gear you need to perform at your best.</li><li>Give you the flexibility to make your own schedule.</li></ul><p>Not only that, but if you join us you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Work in the fitness and nutrition industry.</strong> We love exercise, we love nutrition, and we love sport. That's why we started this company. If you do too, you'll appreciate how rare it is to find a career you really love. For active, fit people, Precision Nutrition is that opportunity.</li><li><strong>Work with fun, bright, and talented people.</strong> We're a small company, and we're picky about who we work with, because to us, this isn't just a job; it's our life.</li></ul><p>If you or someone you know is interested in the position we welcome you to apply below.

We’re pleased to be searching for our ninth support team member. Our ideal hire is motivated by what we’re doing as a company, and eager to contribute on the front lines.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>About the role</h4></div><ul><li>This is a full-time, remote position. You’re someone who thrives working remotely without much (if any) oversight.</li><li>You’ll be a product expert in all areas. You’ll spend most of your days sending timely, human replies to questions via email, but you’ll also craft documentation, troubleshoot potential bugs, and collaborate with the rest of the team to be as helpful as possible to our customers.</li><li>Customer success is a big piece of the pie. You’ll work one-on-one with customers, helping them to get the most out of Help Scout. You might wing unplanned Skype calls and live screen-shares, or schedule meetings to talk about unique use cases.</li><li>We don’t hold you to empty policies or procedures. We expect you to always act in the best interest of the customer. You’ll be given plenty of autonomy to simply do what’s right, no questions asked. With great power comes great responsibility.</li><li>We’re sticklers about the customer experience. We’re always refining and polishing the product to perfection. As someone on the front line, your understanding of the product and our customers is incredibly valuable. You’ll regularly chat with the product team to make sure we’re getting it right.</li><li>Help Scout is focused on the idea of “support-driven growth”, where we emphasize being helpful to our prospects and customers as they pursue their goals. We believe that true sustainable growth for Help Scout is a byproduct of putting our customers and their needs, first. The Support team is one strong part of the Growth team, which means you’ll be actively collaborating with the success, sales and product marketing teams in helping our customers.</li></ul><div><h4>About you</h4></div><ul><li>We’re looking for someone who can work hours that overlap with Asia-Pacific time zones. Because we value work-life balance and creating a sustainable position, you must be geographically located in an equivalent timezone to those regions so you do not need to zone-shift or work far outside of normal business hours where you live).</li><li>This job is Monday-Friday, 9a-5pm in your timezone.</li><li>Help Scout is not able to sponsor a work visa for this position, so you must already be authorized to live and work in the area.</li><li>You’re passionate about support. Former teammates and managers would call you resilient. You’re in it for the long haul, and you’re not looking for the “next best thing”. This isn’t your first rodeo, nor is it a stepping stone. We’re looking for someone with at least one year of support experience.</li><li>You are self-sufficient and love the challenge of solving problems and learning new things. You welcome an environment where you can do great work independently.</li><li>You’re patient and hardy, with an excellent sense of humor. You’re an exceptional listener and educator, and you’re naturally curious with a strong desire to learn.</li><li>You’re an incredible communicator, fluent in written English.

This will initially not require much of your time however you will need to have flexibility during the day (perfect as a side project for someone). This role is as much about managing relationships and problem solving as it is about tech.<br /><br />When one of our sales team makes a sale for an event or a series of events, it's assigned to a support specialist (you). You'll make initial contact with the client for an 'onboarding call' during which you'll confirm with them what they want and what that means in terms of configuring the app for their purpose. This is usually a back and forth process and, on average, takes hours not days.<br /><br />Once the onboarding process is complete and the event is ready, we switch to support mode. This consists of:<br />- testing the app before the event to make sure it works<br />- calling the client just before the event to see if they need any assistance<br />- being available to them during the event in case something goes wrong - sometimes we can troubleshoot level one issues and sometimes we have to escalate them to our tech team<br />- contacting the client post event to see how things went<br /><br />On offer<br /><br />10% of revenue and shares (not a salaried position)<br />Can work remotely<br />You won't have to do anything until we've made a sale then it will be handed over to you<br />Note - this is an opportunity to get involved in a startup that's currently in the garage stage<br /><br />Ideal for<br />A student/recent graduate looking for startup experience and a side hustle<br />A freelancer looking to add another project to their calendar<br /><br />If you have any questions please feel free to get in contact.

You see, it’s pretty hard (and very time consuming) for us to find the truly great candidates, so we ask you make it really obvious to us just how great you are. The easiest way to do that is to address the following questions/topics in your cover letter: 1. What would you work on if you were given a month to do anything that would help users be successful with an application and need less help from Support?2. Why do you want to work in Support, and why would you be a great Decisiv Support Engineer?3. What are your career goals, and how does a Support role and working at Decisiv fit with those goals?4. If you have them, share examples of Support content you’ve personally created (e.g., How-To videos, knowledge base articles, FAQs, API documentation). Don’t have any of your own examples? Share some examples that you think are really good and tell us why.</p>  </div>",
