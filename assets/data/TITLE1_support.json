    "content": "About Koru Kids<br />Koru Kids is London’s fastest growing childcare brand. We’re making it easier and more affordable for families to access high quality childcare. <br /><br />Our after school service matches parents in London with the top 10% of student nannies in London and our nanny share service helps families to share nannies with other local families. <br /><br />We don’t just believe in providing outstanding childcare to families, we are all about using technology to make it seamless for parents. We’ve been blown away by the response from parents and are consistently beating our growth targets. <br /><br />We are backed by fantastic investors, including top venture capitalists and business angels such as Michael Pennington the founder of Gumtree. We won the South of England region in the ‘Best of Britain’ awards 2017, and are currently shortlisted for several awards: the UK Business Awards 2017 as ‘Disruptor of the Year’, and in the Best Women Awards 2017 as ‘Best New Business’, ‘Best Technology’ and ‘Best company working with children and families’.<br /><br />About the Team<br />We have an informal, hard-working and kind team culture. We’re all passionate about our mission and are determined to create the world’s leading childcare brand. Every team member plays a vital role in achieving our goals and we work together so we can get there quicker.  Our approach is fast paced – we are constantly challenging, testing and adapting the way we do things. <br /><br />Our founder is Rachel Carrell, the former CEO of DrThom.com, the world’s largest online doctor service, which she grew to over 1.3m paying users in 3 countries. She’s an Oxford alumn, ex-McKinsey, a Rhodes Scholar and a WEF Young Global Leader. Rachel’s joined by an amazing team with backgrounds including Cambridge, UCL, BCG, KPMG, and some of London’s top startups. <br /><br />We take great care with who we hire and all team members are superbly talented and most importantly really nice! If you’re brilliant AND humble, you’ll fit right in.<br /><br />About the role<br />We have huge growth plans for the business and we need someone to help us take our acquisition to the next level. <br /><br />You don’t need any prior marketing experience but you do need to be pro-active, a fast learner and not afraid to try new things.<br /><br />This role will suit someone who enjoys testing new ideas, validating them and gets a kick out of figuring out how to make things work. You need to be analytical and comfortable with numbers. You’ll be organised, comfortable working at a fast pace and able to task switch.<br /><br />You’ll also spend time working on customer-facing operations. This means speaking to mums (sometimes dads and nannies, but usually mums) on the phone, and emailing/texting them. This will probably be at least 20% of the job. You’ll get to know our parents, what their needs are and therefore how we can best acquire new ones.<br /><br />You need to have excellent English – you’ll be writing compelling and concise copy to catch parents attention.<br /><br />You’ll be a key member of our team, and you’ll get all the training, coaching and support you need to do these things well.<br /><br />Your normal hours of work will be 9am to 6.30pm on weekdays but there may be times when late night are required to cope with spikes in demand. We know you have a private life and other commitments and we work as a team to make sure everyone has a good balance. You’ll normally work from our offices near Old St, although if you like to occasionally work from home that’s totally fine too we support flexibility as long as the work gets done!<br /><br />3 reasons this role is great:<br />-    You will learn a TON. Customer acquisition will be your main focus, but you’ll get plenty of exposure to operations, product, technology and other aspects of the business. You’ll learn how to found a business, about operations, marketing, technology, and finance. <br />-    You’ll be making a huge difference to the everyday lives of parents in London. We’re building a business that will profoundly benefit children, women, and families.<br />-    We’re well-connected in the startup world, so working with us will open lots of doors for you even if you leave. We’ve got a strong track record of helping people we’ve worked with<br /><br />About you<br />We’re after an all-rounder who is clever, practical, positive and nice. We don’t mind what degree you’ve done, as long as you’ve done well in it. We’ll also be looking for evidence of spark and energy in the extracurricular stuff you’ve done.<br />Ideally you will have about 1-2 years of experience in the workforce already. <br /><br />Essential skills<br />-    You’re able to write clearly, simply and accurately, with perfect spelling and grammar<br />-    You like working with numbers and data. We love people who love analysis<br />-    You’re comfortable with speaking to new people, both in person and on the phone<br />-    You’re emotionally intelligent. Although you’ll like to talk, the most important thing you’ll do is listen. Choosing childcare is an emotional decision, and you’ll need to help parents through the process<br />-    You’re a problem-solver. As we are a young company, there aren’t many fixed processes yet. That means you can create new processes, make suggestions, and tell us we’re doing things wrong<br />-    You roll with it. You understand that startups are unpredictable environments. You are comfortable with a degree of chaos<br />-    You’re nice. You get that no player is bigger than the team. You fit right into our culture of supporting and helping each other.<br />Skills/experience that are not essential but would be fantastic<br />-    Passion for design or photography (you would need your own equipment, but again we could certainly create opportunities for you to practice)<br /><br /><br />Benefits<br />-    Competitive salary dependent on experience<br />-    We work from a beautiful co-working space near Old St in central London. The office has a gym and showers, bike storage, free snacks and drinks, and a programme of social events.<br />",

You’re someone who thrives working remotely without much (if any) oversight. You’ll be part of the Support Team which is currently ten people. We’re a fully remote team with employees around world. You’ll be a product expert in all areas.

We’d rather you spent a day solving a tricky problem for an important customer than running through 30 easy tickets.

Writing bug reports and escalations for the product and engineering teams is an important part of the role, we expect you to always act in the best interest of the customer.</div><div><span>You’ll be given plenty of autonomy to simply do what’s right, no questions asked.</span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><b>With great power comes great responsibility.</b></span></div><div><span>As someone on the front line, your understanding of the product and our customers is incredibly valuable. You’ll be able to share knowledge with the product team to make sure we’re getting it right.</span></div><div><span>We believe that sustainable growth for CircleCI is a byproduct of putting our customers and their needs, first. You’ll be actively collaborating with the customer success, customer engineering and product teams to help our customers.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>About CircleCI</b></span></div><div><span>Velocity is critical for software teams in today's competitive landscape, but maintaining speed can be difficult as apps and systems grow larger and more complex. CircleCI’s platform allows developers to rapidly release code (for web and mobile apps) they trust by automating the build, test, and deploy process. CircleCI enables developers to detect and fix bugs before they even reach customers. Thousands of leading companies including Facebook, Kickstarter, Shyp and Spotify rely on CircleCI to accelerate delivery of their code and enable developers to focus on creating business value fast.</span></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><b>CircleCI is a Bay Area Best Places to Work 2016 award winner</b>.

    "content": "<p>GitHub is looking for full-time Enterprise Support Engineers to provide Japanese-language support for our customers in Japan.</p><p>More and more companies are using GitHub Enterprise, so our global Enterprise Support Team is quickly growing. When our customers have problems, they contact us and it is our goal to help them as quickly, and awesomely as possible. We're looking for Japanese language Enterprise Support Engineers to join our Asia Pacific Support team. This role is remote, but candidates must currently be located in Australia, Japan, or New Zealand and possess legal working authorization.</p><p>At GitHub, we take support seriously, and this is not an entry-level position. Our Enterprise Support Engineers are responsible for helping our GitHub Enterprise customers who have our product installed and managed in the customer's virtualization environment. Your main responsibility will be to work with our customers to solve support tickets. Tickets are usually opened by internal system administrators, and can include investigating load or networking issues, debugging application errors, and discussing feature requests. You'll also work with our engineering team to prioritize issues and development, and our documentation team to improve customer-facing resources. You don’t need to be a Git expert, but you do need to have technical experience and a passion for helping people.</p><p>The position reports to an Enterprise Support Manager and works closely with other teams and leaders across the company. GitHub works remotely and asynchronously as much as possible. While this role does not require you to live near one of our offices, it will require some travel to meet with co-workers or attend company events.</p><h2>Responsibilities:</h2><ul><li>Solve complex customer support tickets often involving Linux servers, source code, and web application issues</li><li>Effectively communicate technical information to customers and engineering groups at GitHub</li><li>Work proactively with customers on activities such as coordinating upgrades, communicating upcoming features, and ensuring their installation is running smoothly</li><li>Identify bugs and improvements in the GitHub Enterprise codebase</li><li>Manage urgent customer outages during business hours</li></ul><h2>Minimum Qualifications:</h2><ul><li>Current legal working authorization in Japan</li><li>Experience with Linux</li><li>General understanding of how modern web applications work</li><li>Prior experience providing technical support</li><li>Excellent problem-solving skills</li><li>Familiarity with some flavor of production-level virtual machine (e.g., VMware ESX, Xen, KVM)</li><li>Enthusiasm for working directly with customers</li><li>Stellar Japanese and grammar skills</li><li>Business level English skills</li></ul><h2>Preferred Qualifications:</h2><ul><li>Worked closely with large complex customer accounts</li><li>Familiarity with Git and GitHub</li><li>Experience with phone support</li><li>The ability to look through and understand code (Ruby / Bash)</li><li>Previous experience as a Linux System Administrator</li><li>Previous experience providing on-site consulting or professional services</li></ul><h2>Who We Are:</h2><p>GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over fifteen million people use GitHub to build amazing things together. With the collaborative features of GitHub.com and GitHub Business, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code.</p><h2>What We Value:</h2><p>Collaboration: We believe the best work is done together. Empathy: We believe in putting people first. Quality: We believe in setting the standard for excellence. Positive Impact: We believe in making the world a better place through our work. Shipping: We believe in creating things for the people using them.</p><h2>Why You Should Join:</h2><p>At GitHub, we're committed to quality, collaboration, experimentation...and shipping!</p><p>We constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We've designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe. Additionally, we enable Hubbers who are not based in HQ, to have the flexibility to work in ways that are most effective for them (at home, in a workspace, etc).</p><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative. We've designed our top-notch benefits program with these goals in mind. In a nutshell, we've built a place where we truly love working, we think you will too.</p><p>GitHub is made up of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and lifestyles. We embrace diversity and invite applications from people of all walks of life. We don't discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, disability, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences. Also, if you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you; we're happy to accommodate!</p><p>*Please note that benefits vary by country, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask your Recruiter!</p>",
