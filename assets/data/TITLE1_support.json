To others, that sounds like a great way to have an impact and face new challenges every day. Ideally you're the latter type of person.<br><br><strong>Speaking of ideals, we would love it if you:</strong><br><br></li><li>Have experience working in retail so that you understand where our customers are coming from. <br></li><li>Are a good writer and can clearly express your ideas in writing. <br></li><li>Have a bias for getting things done and making customers happy.<br></li><li>Have a tendency to think proactively instead of just reactively. <br></li><li>Can manage your own schedule and are responsible with your time.<br><br>----<br><br>Oh, we forgot to mention, we're a remote company with a team spread out all over the world. A number of us are in Vancouver and San Francisco, but there is no office. Instead, we give you the flexibility to work from wherever you'd like as long as you can be available during reasonable North American customer support hours. We have twice-annual offsites at fun locations. Our last one was in Whislter, and the one before that was in Costa Rica.</li></ul></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

    "content": "<p>GitHub is looking for full-time Enterprise Support Engineers to provide Japanese-language support for our customers in Japan.</p><p>More and more companies are using GitHub Enterprise, so our global Enterprise Support Team is quickly growing. When our customers have problems, they contact us and it is our goal to help them as quickly, and awesomely as possible. We're looking for Japanese language Enterprise Support Engineers to join our Asia Pacific Support team. This role is remote, but candidates must currently be located in Australia, Japan, or New Zealand and possess legal working authorization.</p><p>At GitHub, we take support seriously, and this is not an entry-level position. Our Enterprise Support Engineers are responsible for helping our GitHub Enterprise customers who have our product installed and managed in the customer's virtualization environment. Your main responsibility will be to work with our customers to solve support tickets. Tickets are usually opened by internal system administrators, and can include investigating load or networking issues, debugging application errors, and discussing feature requests. You'll also work with our engineering team to prioritize issues and development, and our documentation team to improve customer-facing resources. You don’t need to be a Git expert, but you do need to have technical experience and a passion for helping people.</p><p>The position reports to an Enterprise Support Manager and works closely with other teams and leaders across the company. GitHub works remotely and asynchronously as much as possible. While this role does not require you to live near one of our offices, it will require some travel to meet with co-workers or attend company events.</p><h2>Responsibilities:</h2><ul><li>Solve complex customer support tickets often involving Linux servers, source code, and web application issues</li><li>Effectively communicate technical information to customers and engineering groups at GitHub</li><li>Work proactively with customers on activities such as coordinating upgrades, communicating upcoming features, and ensuring their installation is running smoothly</li><li>Identify bugs and improvements in the GitHub Enterprise codebase</li><li>Manage urgent customer outages during business hours</li></ul><h2>Minimum Qualifications:</h2><ul><li>Current legal working authorization in Japan</li><li>Experience with Linux</li><li>General understanding of how modern web applications work</li><li>Prior experience providing technical support</li><li>Excellent problem-solving skills</li><li>Familiarity with some flavor of production-level virtual machine (e.g., VMware ESX, Xen, KVM)</li><li>Enthusiasm for working directly with customers</li><li>Stellar Japanese and grammar skills</li><li>Business level English skills</li></ul><h2>Preferred Qualifications:</h2><ul><li>Worked closely with large complex customer accounts</li><li>Familiarity with Git and GitHub</li><li>Experience with phone support</li><li>The ability to look through and understand code (Ruby / Bash)</li><li>Previous experience as a Linux System Administrator</li><li>Previous experience providing on-site consulting or professional services</li></ul><h2>Who We Are:</h2><p>GitHub is the best place to share code with friends, co-workers, classmates, and complete strangers. Over fifteen million people use GitHub to build amazing things together. With the collaborative features of GitHub.com and GitHub Business, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code.</p><h2>What We Value:</h2><p>Collaboration: We believe the best work is done together. Empathy: We believe in putting people first. Quality: We believe in setting the standard for excellence. Positive Impact: We believe in making the world a better place through our work. Shipping: We believe in creating things for the people using them.</p><h2>Why You Should Join:</h2><p>At GitHub, we're committed to quality, collaboration, experimentation...and shipping!</p><p>We constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We've designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe. Additionally, we enable Hubbers who are not based in HQ, to have the flexibility to work in ways that are most effective for them (at home, in a workspace, etc).</p><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative. We've designed our top-notch benefits program with these goals in mind. In a nutshell, we've built a place where we truly love working, we think you will too.</p><p>GitHub is made up of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and lifestyles. We embrace diversity and invite applications from people of all walks of life. We don't discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, disability, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences. Also, if you have a disability, please let us know if there's any way we can make the interview process better for you; we're happy to accommodate!</p><p>*Please note that benefits vary by country, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask your Recruiter!</p>",

We are proud to be voted a “Top 3” employer on Glassdoor by our own employees, and positioned as a market leader by industry experts like Gartner. We serve the second-largest financial services industry in the world (after banking), worth $2 trillion USD. We build the core applications that companies use to sell insurance policies, settle claims, and bill their customers. We also have a portfolio of products serving the innovative needs of our customers in areas such as data management, digital online portals, and predictive analytics. We serve customers all over the world, helping them handle billions of dollars of business. This is a lucrative and underserved market, and we have grown rapidly through a combination of quality products, excellent service, innovative technology, and a passionate belief in our core values of rationality, collegiality &amp; integrity.<br><br>The applications we build are large and extraordinarily complex, and they have to work reliably. More importantly, they have to be able to be implemented in a strategic and timely manner, and of course in a way that keeps them flexible yet maintainable. We’re looking for an experienced Customer Partner that can build and maintain a strong relationship with our managed services customers, and whom can provide maintenance and implementation leadership on the ground at the customer’s work location. This role will serve as a customer lead and will work directly with the GPS team back in the Dublin office. As the leader and chief customer advocate, you will collaborate closely with an impressive team of peers whose primary goal is our customer’s success. While leadership capability is important, the successful candidate will also have the ability to roll up their sleeves and get involved in the application configuration and integration work that is required to care for the customer’s implementation. We particularly value demonstrated leadership capability, excellent organization skills, negotiation skills to successfully work as a liaison between the customer and the Guidewire GPS team, and of course the ability to work well as part of an overall team.<br><br><b>The Role:</b><br>The Guidewire Services Center in Dublin, Ireland was established to help meet a growing global customer demand for expertise in implementing Guidewire’s products.

This team will deploy, enhance, and maintain our customer’s Guidewire product instance(s) in a hosted environment. The GPS Customer Partner will serve as a dedicated customer advocate and trusted advisor, and will be responsible for the identification, elaboration, high level design, and prioritization of the customer’s production defects and system enhancements. These defects and enhancements must then be communicated to the GPS team in the Dublin office, so strong project management and communication skills are a must. For the first 2-3 months after go live, the Customer Partner will work on site directly with the customer, but it is expected as time goes on this role will be done on a remote basis with occasional on site visits necessary.<br><br><b>Responsibilities:</b><br>We live by our core principles of integrity, rationality, and collegiality. Your first responsibility is always to adhere to these principles in everything that you do.<br>Authorized to work in the U.S. or Canada, with preference given to somebody located in the Northeastern U.S.<br>This role will require ability to travel onsite to the customer on a scheduled basis.

While the Customer Partner will work during normal business hours of the customer, occasional high priority work outside of established business hours may be necessary (i.e., to help with urgent customer issues).<br><br><b>Desired Skills/Experience:</b><br>Strong communication and interpersonal skills (mandatory)<br>Applied Project Management experience (mandatory)<br>Demonstrated problem solving skills (mandatory)<br>Ability to prioritize tasks and differentiate between Production issues and future enhancement work<br>Proven ability to influence customers and build relationships, both with “on the ground” resources and those in Management/Executive roles<br>7+ years of working with Guidewire core applications<br>5+ years of experience leading and managing implementation teams (or team tracks) within a Corporate IT or Consulting environment (Guidewire projects preferred)<br>Flexible, enthusiastic approach to work including a strong desire to learn new products and a new business domain<br>Strong Guidewire Configuration skills necessary to assist with development activity<br>Experience working in an environment with cloud/off-premise enterprise applications<br>Experience working with leading cloud platform Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers such as AWS or Microsoft Azure<br>Experience with a commercial customer incident tracking or CRM system<br>Experience using a software defect tracking system such as JIRA<br>Ability to direct work effort based on a dynamic work environment<br><br><b>Requirements:</b><br>Bachelors in Computer Science or equivalent from higher education institution<br>Advanced exposure to broad technical skills such as Object Oriented programming (JAVA , C#, or similar), relational databases (data modeling/SQL), web UI (design and development), XML, application architecture<br>Software development lifecycle exposure (AGILE) preferred<br><br>Why Guidewire?<br>As a team, our mission is to provide distinguished consulting and support services to prospects, partners, and customers which result in 100 percent reference-able customers which guides us in all that we do.<br><br>Guidewire has pursued one mission from its founding as a company in 2001: to be the pre-eminent provider of next-generation core systems — policy, claims, and billing — to the global property-casualty insurance industry. All of our employees understand that we serve only one industry and strive to solve one problem: to enable insurance carriers to migrate completely from legacy systems to a modern core system platform. We have recruited extensively among experts in the industry to ensure that we learn from veterans of insurance system design and implementation. Today, insurance experience is pervasive throughout the Guidewire organization, especially in our Product Management and Implementation Services groups. The company is headquartered in Foster City, California, US with offices in London, Dublin, Paris, Munich, Sydney, Toronto, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and operations in Poland and mainland China.

We are proud to be voted a “Top 3” employer on Glassdoor by our own employees and positioned as a market leader by industry experts like Gartner. We serve the second-largest financial services industry in the world (after banking), worth $2 trillion USD. We build the core applications that companies use to sell insurance policies, settle claims, and bill their customers. We also have a portfolio of products serving the innovative needs of our customers in areas such as data management, digital online portals, and predictive analytics. We serve customers all over the world, helping them handle billions of dollars of business. This is a lucrative and underserved market, and we have grown rapidly through a combination of quality products, excellent service, innovative technology, and a passionate belief in our core values of rationality, collegiality &amp; integrity.<br><br>The applications we build are large and extraordinarily complex, and they have to work reliably. More importantly, they have to be able to be implemented in a strategic and timely manner, and of course in a way that keeps them flexible yet maintainable. We’re looking for an experienced Customer Partner that can build and maintain a strong relationship with our managed services customers, and whom can provide maintenance and implementation leadership on the ground at the customer’s work location.

These defects and enhancements must then be communicated to the GPS team in the Dublin office, so strong project management and communication skills are a must.

Your first responsibility is always to adhere to these principles in everything that you do.<br>Authorized to work in the U.S. or Canada, with preference given to somebody located in the Northeastern U.S.<br>This role will require the ability to travel onsite to the customer on a scheduled basis.

While the Customer Partner will work during normal business hours of the customer, occasional high priority work outside of established business hours may be necessary (i.e., to help with urgent customer issues).<br><br><b>Desired Skills/Experience:</b><br>Strong communication and interpersonal skills (mandatory)<br>Applied Project Management experience (mandatory)<br>Demonstrated problem-solving skills (mandatory)<br>Ability to prioritize tasks and differentiate between Production issues and future enhancement work<br>Proven ability to influence customers and build relationships, both with “on the ground” resources and those in Management/Executive roles<br>7+ years of working with Guidewire core applications<br>5+ years of experience leading and managing implementation teams (or team tracks) within a Corporate IT or Consulting environment (Guidewire projects preferred)<br>Flexible, enthusiastic approach to work including a strong desire to learn new products and a new business domain<br>Strong Guidewire Configuration skills necessary to assist with development activity<br>Experience working in an environment with cloud/off-premise enterprise applications<br>Experience working with leading cloud platform Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers such as AWS or Microsoft Azure<br>Experience with a commercial customer incident tracking or CRM system<br>Experience using a software defect tracking system such as JIRA<br>Ability to direct work effort based on a dynamic work environment<br><br><b>Requirements:</b><br>Bachelors in Computer Science or equivalent from higher education institution<br>Advanced exposure to broad technical skills such as Object Oriented programming (JAVA , C#, or similar), relational databases (data modeling/SQL), web UI (design and development), XML, application architecture<br>Software development lifecycle exposure (AGILE) preferred<br><br>Why Guidewire?<br>As a team, our mission is to provide distinguished consulting and support services to prospects, partners, and customers which result in 100 percent reference-able customers which guides us in all that we do.<br><br>Guidewire has pursued one mission from its founding as a company in 2001: to be the pre-eminent provider of next-generation core systems — policy, claims, and billing — to the global property-casualty insurance industry. All of our employees understand that we serve only one industry and strive to solve one problem: to enable insurance carriers to migrate completely from legacy systems to a modern core system platform. We have recruited extensively among experts in the industry to ensure that we learn from veterans of insurance system design and implementation. Today, insurance experience is pervasive throughout the Guidewire organization, especially in our Product Management and Implementation Services groups.
