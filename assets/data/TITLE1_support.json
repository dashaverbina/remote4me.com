We’re searching for a </span><span><b>New Client Coordinator</b></span><span> to help our CEO and the rest of our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can </span><span><b>set your own hours</b></span><span>, </span><span><b>take holidays as you see fit</b></span><span>, </span><span><b>work remotely from home or anywhere in the world</b></span><span>, and </span><span><b>help medical research succeed</b></span><span>, then please read on. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Our clients</b></span><span> – academic researchers and medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Our company</b></span><span> – Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span></span></div><div><b>We're looking for someone who can: </b></div><div><br></div><div><b>Communicate</b>— A large part of this role involves corresponding with and educating potential clients, mostly by email. This includes responding to enquiries generated by our outbound email campaign and inbound through our website, as well as following up with each new client opportunity.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Coordinate</b>— You’ll be performing the critical role of managing each potential new client opportunity as a project. It’s your job to coordinate with our CEO Nick; who is our salesperson, Jess; who performs our Due Diligence process, and researchers; our potential clients, to ensure that each opportunity is progressing through the stages of our new client pipeline like a well-oiled machine.</div><div><br></div><div><span>To do this you’ll need a relentless focus on next steps, client education, coordination of people, and serious organization skills to do this at scale across a large number of new client opportunities simultaneously.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Learn</b>— No experience is necessary, but you’ll need to rapidly develop a thorough understanding of the industry, our clients, their concerns, our service, and new software and technology. You’ll be trained and work closely with our CEO, so you can hit the ground running, but you’ll also need to be able to independently learn via courses and other resources that we’ll pay for.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Market</b>— The other part of this role is to work with our CEO Nick and other team members to implement additional marketing strategies to grow the number of new client meetings performed by Nick each week. Right now we’re seeing a lot of success from, and are mostly focused on our content marketing.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What's in it for you:</b></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Autonomy</b></span><span> — We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a holiday policy (you can take holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><span>Our team is remote (we communicate via&nbsp;</span><a href='https://slack.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>Slack</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://hangouts.google.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>Google Hangouts</span></a><span> and </span><a href='https://basecamp.com' rel='nofollow'><span>Basecamp</span></a><span>). We set our own hours based on what works for us and our clients. As long as you have a good internet connection you can work from wherever you choose.</span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Innovation</b></span><span> —&nbsp;</span><span>We’re the first and only company in our industry to guarantee our results. We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g. our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews</span><span>) that provide predictability and certainty in a volatile industry, and we’re constantly improving our service. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We apply the same innovative approach internally to how we operate our business. We’ve streamlined and automated (think templated emails, automated follow-up, and optimized proposal templates) a lot of our new opportunity pipeline, and are constantly testing the latest and greatest sales automation tools (e.g.&nbsp;</span><a href='https://mixmax.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>Mixmax</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://www.prosperworks.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>ProsperWorks</span></a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href='https://zapier.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>Zapier</span></a><span> etc)</span><span>. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Impact</b></span><span> — Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clients—researchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practices—work hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are the only company that solves recruitment problems in a predictable and reliable way—our consistent, results-driven process makes us the only recruitment company that provides a money-back guarantee.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Growth</b></span><span> — As a member of a small team you'll be exposed to many areas of the business. You'll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You'll be testing and implementing new marketing strategies. You'll have access to courses and training programs of your choice, paid for by Trialfacts.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Opportunity</b></span><span> — As a small and innovative team we’ve done away with outdated corporate thinking like the physical office, micromanaging and bureaucratic leave processes, but we haven’t thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We offer a stable salary + results-based compensation package, discretionary annual bonuses, annual salary review, a personal and tailored development plan reviewed with you every three months, and the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and leadership in the future.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re growing rapidly through repeat business, referrals and new clients. We're an innovative company in an industry ripe for disruption. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>This position is for you if you:</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><ul><li><span><b>Excel at written &amp; spoken communication</b></span><span> - from answering potential client emails to communicating with colleagues, being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position, and especially this one. Being in a remote team, you must be great at communicating, and if necessary be willing to pick up the phone and speak with our clients.</span></li><li><span><b>Are highly organized</b></span><span> - you'll be interacting with many different potential clients, while also managing enquiries from existing lead generation campaigns. If you're not highly organized and comfortable in a fast-paced environment then you're not a good-fit for this role.</span></li><li><span><b>Are flexible</b></span><span> - in an entrepreneurial business we sometimes have to wear different hats. We're looking for someone that takes ownership and wants to help grow our company. If you're the kind of person who would rather sit back and say </span><em>&quot;that's not my responsibility&quot;</em><span> then please don't apply.</span><br></li></ul><ul><li><span><b>Love learning</b></span><span> - we're a team that's driven by learning and improving. We're looking for someone who wants to learn and develop their professional and business skills, grow as a person and constantly improve the service that we provide. This includes someone who is comfortable getting up to speed quickly and is able to quickly understand the unique situation each client is in.</span></li><li><span><b>Have a passion for making data-driven decisions</b></span><span> - these days marketing and all parts of business requires a love of data. If you’re not comfortable with gathering, cleaning and interpreting data, then please don’t apply. You don’t need to have a statistics PhD, but if you’re not comfortable with Excel, then this is not the position for you.</span></li><li><b>Are proficient in HTML</b> - Similar to the above, marketing today relies heavily on technology and automation. You don’t need any formal development experience but if you’re not comfortable with at least HTML, please don’t apply. Similarly, if you’re not the kind of person that loves testing out new tools and technology, this position is not a good fit.<br></li><li><span><b>Are results-driven</b></span><span> - you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance which will directly impact your compensation.</span></li><li><span><b>Are looking for a full-time position</b></span><span> - we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed fairly quickly. We’re not looking for someone who has their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side.</span></li></ul><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><b>Summary</b></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Yes, this position description is so long that it needs a summary! Here are the facts: &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Set your own hours</b>: Choose when and how you work, but there needs to be some flexibility to have training and meetings with our CEO Nick, located in Australia. This is a full-time position.</li><li><b>Work remotely</b>: We’re a virtual team located around the globe. You can live nearly anywhere or travel with this position. You will need a reliable internet connection.</li><li><b>Results-based environment</b>: You’ll be evaluated based on your results. You will not be micromanaged, and you have the flexibility to set your own hours and work however you like, but you need to be contributing to our target number of new client conversations scheduled with our CEO Nick each week, and the number of new clients we welcome onboard each month.</li><li><b>Commitment to learning</b>: We believe in continuous improvement and growth. You’ll be mentored, guided, and trained by our CEO Nick, our team and external resources, courses and training programs paid for by Trialfacts.</li><li><b>Contribute something meaningful to the world</b>: We make a lot of medical research possible that would otherwise fail, and remove the #1 headache faced by researchers in a predictable and reliable manner, backed by our money-back guarantee.</li><li><b>Trial period</b>: There will be an initial paid trial period probably lasting 2-3 weeks, but it’s possible it might be longer.</li><li><b>Compensation</b>: Compensation will be a monthly salary plus performance-based compensation package. Salaries are reviewed annually.</li></ul><div><span></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>If you're interested in this position, then please email us at <a href='mailto:applications@trialfacts.com' rel='nofollow'>applications@trialfacts.com</a> with the subject “New Client Coordinator Application – [Your Name]” and tell us why we should consider you. Please also let us know how you heard about this position, and include in your application your current career goals and why you would like this position. Please also address where you will think you’ll be located.Please note, you may find the application process differs a little from what you might expect. Although there will be phone interviews, an interview alone is a poor way to assess a candidate, so I’ll also be asking you to complete a few short tasks. These tasks are quick and designed to be fun and informative, but also to assess something about you. After each task I will let you know if you were successful in proceeding to the next round. If all goes well I’ll ask you to undertake a paid trial to see if there is a good fit, before making a final decision.</p>  </div>",

You’ll be joining a small, friendly team that’s committed to providing the highest standard of customer support online, seven days a week.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Until now, we’ve provided support in English (with a few neat tricks for helping customers who reach out in another language). But as we grow, we’re seeking to offer the same level of support in languages as diverse as our customers. Italian is just the first of several bilingual roles we’re planning to fill.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>But regardless of the languages you speak, you’ll learn lots about our technology, including how to debug the trickiest issues, and more than you ever dreamed of about trains!</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><ul><li>This is a Monday - Friday role, with occasional weekend work. Everyone on the Mon-Fri support team is on rotation to support the weekend team (you’ll get time off in lieu).<br></li><li>You’ll need to be online during office hours, usually from 9.30-6 GMT or thereabouts. There’s some flexibility in that once you’re up to speed.<br></li><li>This is a remote job, but you won’t be alone. You will have online tools like Slack, Help Scout, Trello and Basecamp to find the answer to your query or reach out for help.<br></li><li>We offer a generous holiday allowance, options for flexible working, a sound travel policy for when you’re invited to the office and a salary that reflects your experience.<br></li></ul><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><div><b><span>What you'll be doing</span></b></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This job isn’t the same day in, day out. Far from it. This is a varied, troubleshooting role with loads of opportunity to dig into the detail and offer creative solutions for our users.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>It will be your job to decide the best way to help our growing number of customers without sacrificing quality. You’ll have autonomy to provide the best style of online support. You can point customers to our Help docs or make a quick screencast to demo a feature, whatever you think works best for them.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We’re continually improving our product and support style, so you’ll also share the responsibility of identifying gaps in our Help content (or mistakes in the machine-translated docs we currently offer in Italian), reporting bugs, suggesting UX improvements and finding ways to reduce the volume of incoming customer queries. We’re planning to offer live chat support later this year so that will become part of your role, too.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>As a fluent Italian-speaker, you’ll be the first port of call for our Italian customers, providing exceptional support in their native language. At the moment, these represent a small proportion of incoming queries so the rest of the time you’ll be on shift with the English crew. You’ll also be part of our internationalisation plans, contributing to projects to improve our multi-language product and resources.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><div><b><span>About you</span><br></b></div><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><ul><li><b>Bilingual</b> - Italian is your first language, but you have impeccable English, too. If you also speak Spanish or French to a similar standard, we already love you.<br></li><li><b>Independent</b> - You have the ability to identify and solve tricky issues on your own initiative, but aren’t too proud to ask for help when needed. You can clearly articulate problems in writing so they can be picked up and resolved by somebody else if you aren’t online.<br></li><li><b>Tech-savvy</b><span><b> </b>- You aren’t fazed by complex technology or information, and enjoy wrapping your brain around new challenges.You’ll probably download our app right now just to try it out.</span><br></li><li><b>Level-headed</b> - You're patient and empathetic with others, especially if they're not as technology-literate as you (or even if they're just having a bad day).<br></li><li><b>Emotionally intelligent</b> - You can think laterally to solve customer (and your own!) frustration.<br></li><li><b>Conscientious</b> - You’ll be given plenty of autonomy to simply do what’s right, no questions asked. With great power comes great responsibility. You’ll have a high degree autonomy; working weekends means fewer teammates around for support.<br></li><li><b>Excellent written communication skills</b> - You are pedantic about spelling and grammar,<span> but remain an affable human being nonetheless.</span><br></li><li>We’re happy to receive applications from people with a lot or a little experience of providing online customer support. The important thing is sound communication skills (in Italian and English), empathy and a willingness to learn.<br></li><li>You’re someone who thrives working remotely and have a home-office environment that’s fit for remote work.<br></li><li>You’re in a European time-zone.<br></li></ul><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><div><b><span>Nice to have</span><br></b></div><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><ul><li>You’ve travelled and understand<span> the unique stresses of making international trips.</span><br></li><li>Prior experience of working with online booking platforms, and a knack for figuring out how they work<br></li><li>Familiarity with European rail network, particularly Italian operators, Trenitalia and Italo.
