We’ve been featured in The New York Times, Time, Mashable, Daily Mail, VentureBeat, and many more <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/what-users-say/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>publications in dozens of countries</a>.</p><h5>Who Works For us?</h5><p>We work with a remote team of contractors in dozens of countries all over the world: from Bosnia to the UK to Canada to Australia. We continue to grow at a fast rate, and are looking for more writers to add to our team to keep up the pace.</p><h5>What's It Like Writing for Us?</h5><p>The work is highly varied, but there is always writing work available for our team of freelance writers.</p><p>One writer might produce a <a href=&quot;http://whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/siteground/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>profle of a hosting company</a> on Monday, an introduction to the <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/c-sharp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>C# programming language</a> on Wednesday, and a blog post about people <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2015/12/09/chatbots/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>falling in love with chatbots</a> on Friday.</p><p>If that mix sounds exciting, rather than terrifying, then maybe you are the right type of writer to join our team.</p><p>Our CEO is a former writer/editor, and understands the value of quality content.</p><h5>Job Requirements</h5><p>Our team of writers is varied. We have a grumpy physics PhD, an idealistic MBA with a side hustle in Hollywood, and a hyperactive former greyhound racing gambler <em>(or so he says)</em>. </p><p>We have wonderful writers that have worked for some of the world's biggest websites. And we have exceptional people who only write for us.</p><p>We aren't looking for clones. But everyone who works for us shares a handful of key attributes:</p><ul><li>Native English speaker with strong writing skills (<em>US English, although you can be based anywhere</em>)</li><li>Exceptional online research skills</li><li>Some degree of technical proficiency (<em>eg, two of our writers can code, most run websites/blogs</em>)</li><li>Well organized &amp;  rock steady reliable (<em>ie, deadlines get met on our team</em>)</li><li>Working knowledge of HTML and WordPress (<em>just the basics, nothing fancy</em>)</li></ul><h5>How Do We Work?</h5><p>You'll be working as part of <a href=&quot;http://www.qualitynonsense.com/our-team/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>our remote team</a> located in dozens of countries around thw world. We use a few common tools to make that work:-</p><ul><li>Gmail</li><li>Google Docs</li><li>Asana</li><li>WordPress</li><li>Skype</li><li>Slack</li></ul><h5>What's a Typical Project Like?</h5><p>We do a lot of different work. Check out our website, especially the <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>blog</a> and <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>resources</a> sections.</p><p>We are especially interested in people who can tackle very technical subjects, like resources on programming languages. A good example of this is our resource on the <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/forth-programming/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Forth programming language</a>.</p><p>Articles are often 1000+ words <em>(and we even have one 60,000 word FAQ!).</em> We are very clear on what we want on every project.</p><p>Most articles can be researched online. However, some will require expert interviews via Skype or phone <em>(we'll cover costs)</em>.</p><h5>Workload</h5><p>We have as much work as you can handle. We have freelance writers producing as much as 10,000 words per week.  We are looking for writers available of a minimum of one day/week, due to the overhead of managing many writers.</p><p>We don't micro-manage. We provide projects with descriptions including due dates and required length. There is sometimes communication back and forth <em>(Asana is great for this)</em>.</p><p>But mostly, you write the article and turn it in, we edit it and publish. Writers invoice every other week, and get paid in US dollars by PayPal or wire transfer.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

We continue to grow at a fast rate, and are looking for more writers to add to our team to keep up the pace.<h2>What's It Like Writing for Us?</h2><p>The work is highly varied, but there is always writing work available for our team of freelance writers.</p>One writer might produce a <a href=&quot;http://whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/siteground/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>profle of a hosting company</a> on Monday, an introduction to the <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/c-sharp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>C# programming language</a> on Wednesday, and a blog post about people <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2015/12/09/chatbots/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>falling in love with chatbots</a> on Friday.<p>If that mix sounds exciting, rather than terrifying, then maybe you are the right type of writer to join our team.</p><p>Our CEO is a former writer/editor, and understands the value of quality content.</p><h2>Job Requirements</h2><p>Our team of writers is varied. We have a grumpy physics PhD, an idealistic MBA with a side hustle in Hollywood, and a hyperactive former greyhound racing gambler <em>(or so he says)</em>. We have wonderful writers that have worked for some of the world's biggest websites. And we have exceptional people who only write for us.</p><p>We aren't looking for clones. But everyone who works for us shares a handful of key attributes:</p><ul><li>Native English speaker with strong writing skills<br><em>(US English, although you can be based anywhere)</em>;</li><li>Exceptional online research skills;</li><li>Some degree of technical proficiency<br><em>(eg, two of our writers can code, most run websites/blogs)</em></li><li>Well organized &amp;  rock steady reliable;<br><em>(ie, deadlines get met on our team)</em></li><li>Working knowledge of HTML and WordPress</li><em>(Just the basics, nothing fancy.)</em></ul><li><h2>How Do We Work?</h2>You'll be working as part of <a href=&quot;http://www.qualitynonsense.com/our-team/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>our remote team</a> located in dozens of countries around thw world. We use a few common tools to make that work:-<ul><li>Gmail</li><li>Google Docs</li><li>Asana</li><li>WordPress</li><li>Skype</li><li>Slack</li></ul><h2>What's a Typical Project Like?</h2>We do a lot of different work. Check out our website, especially the <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>blog</a> and <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>resources</a> sections.</li><p></p>We are especially interested in people who can tackle very technical subjects, like resources on programming languages. A good example of this is our resource on the <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/forth-programming/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Forth programming language</a>.Articles are often 1000+ words <em>(and we even have one 60,000 word FAQ!).</em> We are very clear on what we want on every project.Most articles can be researched online. However, some will require expert interviews via Skype or phone <em>(we'll cover costs)</em>.<h2>Workload</h2>We have as much work as you can handle. We have freelance writers producing as much as 10,000 words per week.  We are looking for writers available of a minimum of one day/week, due to the overhead of managing many writers.We don't micro-manage. We provide projects with descriptions including due dates and required length. There is sometimes communication back and forth <em>(Asana is great for this)</em>.But mostly, you write the article and turn it in, we edit it and publish. Writers invoice every other week, and get paid in US dollars by PayPal or wire transfer.",

    "content": "<div>                  <span>Expensify - Portland, OR, San Francisco, CA  Designer, Infrastructure, Customer Success<p>Hey there! Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don't suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:</p><p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.</p><p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Cambodia, Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia, Portugal and the Philippines. Our most recent trip was Uruguay in January, where do you want to go next?</p><p>- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.</p><p>- Specifically talented in a programming way (or if not, shoot as an email anyways!). You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you. And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know you are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?</p><p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=&quot;http://we.are.expensify.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://we.are.expensify.com</a>) or email us at jobs@expensify.com. We are excited to hear from you!<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                        </p></div></span></div>",
