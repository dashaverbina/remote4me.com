Every month, more than 250,000 volunteer editors contribute to Wikipedia. Based in San Francisco, California, the Wikimedia Foundation is an audited, 501(c)(3) non-profit that is funded primarily through donations and grants. It currently employs over 300 staff members.</p><p>At the Foundation, we build technology to help people everywhere access Wikipedia, across devices and in nearly 300 languages. We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia. Roughly a quarter of our budget goes to supporting the community that&nbsp;make&nbsp;the site possible, including through&nbsp;grantmaking programs&nbsp;that enable volunteers and enrich the information on the sites.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage people with a diverse range of backgrounds to apply.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully paid premiums for medical, dental &amp; vision                            </div>                            <div>                                 401(k) Retirement Plan                            </div>                            <div>                                 Short and Long Term Disability Insurance                            </div>                            <div>                                 Life and AD&amp;D Insurance                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible Spending Transportation &amp; Parking Plan                            </div>                            <div>                                 Parental Support                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wellness Program ($1800/a year)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Employee Assistance Program (EAP)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible Spending Account Plan                            </div>                            <div>                                 Personal development/education                            </div>                    ",
