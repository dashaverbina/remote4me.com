Whether you need items delivered to a jobsite, don't have time to stop at the store, or simply crave donuts from across town, we can get it to you.</p><p>THE ROLE</p><p>You’ll be one of the first members of the engineering team and will be influential in the technical direction of the platform as we grow.  This is a high responsibility, high autonomy position and you’ll be deploying code to production within the first day or two.  You’ll be encouraged to propose features and functionality as the platform continues to mature.</p><p>We believe that product development is more fun when deploying early and often, splitting up work into bite-sized chunks and getting feedback from real users as quickly as possible.  We also believe that a single engineer should be empowered to develop a feature from start to finish, and that the technology stack should be simple enough to make that realistic.</p><p>WHAT YOU’LL DO</p><p>- Design and write well-structured, easily maintainable, and thoroughly tested code</p><p>- Participate in code reviews to ensure quality and consistency in the codebase, and to keep the team aligned</p><p>- Deploy your projects to production frequently and monitor the results to ensure quality and positive outcome</p><p>- Accept feedback from customers and adapt solutions with an eye for usability</p><p>- Work with the rest of the product team to come up with ways to make the product better overall</p><p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</p><p>- Experience building and supporting web applications in a full-stack capacity</p><p>- Proficiency with Ruby on Rails or Javascript/React, and with an interest in getting your hands dirty on both backend and frontend</p><p>- A desire to dig into new technologies and learn as you go</p><p>- Bonus: React Native, iOS, Android, ElasticSearch, Google Maps APIs</p><p>Reach out to me at peter.cullen@dispatchwithus.com if you're interested!<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

We’re an adtech company empowering publishers and advertisers to connect more efficiently.</p><p>Don’t let the “adtech” part scare you away: our mission is to help publishers better monetize their sites so they can spend their time focusing on what they care about (their content!) rather than selling ads. We leverage tech to help broker these sales, and attempt to distance ourselves from the shady world of advertising that existed before.</p><p>StackOverflow, CodingHorror.com, NPR, and The Atlantic are just some of the sites who we’re able to help make more money - connecting them with advertisers like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Braintree, and Atlassian who are all able to expand their reach through us.</p><p>We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 30 some-odd people spread out across 30+ cities in 5 countries (please note that right now we are requiring a large overlap with Eastern Time, however). We use PHP, Go, Rails, and React, but seek to hire developers who are language agnostic and are more interested in shipping quality code than bikeshedding it.</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p><p>We’re looking for developers at any level (junior, intermediate, senior) to help us build out our platform. Regardless of level, everyone on our dev team makes meaningful contributions that positively impact our team and our customers every day - you will likely ship code on your very first day at BSA.</p><p>Ideally, we’re looking for someone who is:</p><ul><li>Comfortable across the full stack of the development cycle: frontend, backend, database stuff, as well as following through with testing and shipping.</li><li>A self-starter: remote teams carry lots of autonomy. There’s no micromanaging here.</li><li>A great communicator: we’re big on teaching, learning, debating, and explaining, and these things require clear, deliberate communication.</li><li>Wary of bullet lists with more than 3 items in job postings: we aren’t heavily process-oriented or believe in tons of structure, and if your eyes have glazed over while reading this list, you might just fit right in.</li></ul><p>You’re likely more awesome than you think, so please apply even if you only check a few of these boxes.</p><p><strong>Interested?</strong></p><p>Woohoo! To apply, send us a blurb about who you are and what you’re into to devjob_q4_2017@buysellads.com. If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on what you like to build, things you’ve built in the past that you’re proud of, and what you’d like to be building now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</p><p>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straight-forward: we do an initial meet-and-greet phone screen, a live pair-coding session over Slack (our primary mode of communication), and a take-home coding test. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess. (For reference, in our last hiring round in the summer we responded to 100% of direct applicants and the average response time to an applicant was under 24 hours. The average time from initial contact to us extending an offer was 11 days.)</p><p>And if we are the right fit for each other? Awesome! Come build a platform to help fix advertising with us.</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> 100% remote team, high-impact role on a strong engineering team</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

If you think of yourself as a product designer as much as a UX designer, we should definitely talk.

We're a smart, passionate group of people who work hard to deliver the best survey experiences on the planet, period. We believe everyone deserves easy access to the information and insights they need to make great decisions.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We're also proud to admit that despite our incredible growth over the past 17 years, we refuse to grow up. We stay curious. We believe in good ol’ roll-up-your-sleeves scrappiness. Everyone plays an impactful role, because we’re here to make a difference. And when we say good ideas can come from anyone, we mean it.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>SurveyMonkey is trusted by millions of customers, including 99% of the Fortune 500, as well as other businesses, academic institutions and organizations of all shapes and sizes. We collect over 3 million survey responses daily from people in all countries around the world.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>SurveyMonkey is the world’s most popular survey platform. While it is a great general-purpose tool used by millions, there is ample opportunity for more specialized solutions. That’s where we come in. We build standalone, targeted SaaS products that bring great UX to solving more specific business problems.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>To date, our 10-person team has shipped three products:</div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement </li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Source and publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li></ul><div></div><div>We operate each solution as a small startup within the larger SurveyMonkey organization. This affords us flexibility to quickly try new ideas, but with the resources of larger company. Our goal -- and our track record -- is to build high growth, profitable businesses that leverage the enormous user base of SurveyMonkey.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We’re looking for a talented designer with demonstrable experience working on user-friendly SaaS applications. Your portfolio should demonstrate the ability to design for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop. You should also be comfortable writing clear, concise UI copy.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Strong visual design, product design, usability, and communication skills are essential. Technical skills such as CSS, Javascript, and familiarity with Ruby on Rails are also a strong plus, though not required. Experience mentoring and/or managing junior designers would also be a big plus. </div><div><br></div><div></div><div>If you like working closely with developers and other designers and love designing data-rich visualizations, we should talk. If you think of yourself as a product designer as much as a UX designer, we should definitely talk. If you have some Tufte books on your shelf and are the kind of person others look to to tease out subtle edge cases in an interface, we should <em>absolutely</em> talk.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>Why Work Here?</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific timezone by at least four hours, where you live and work and up to you. We’re not strangers though -- in addition to a sane amount of video calls, we meet up quarterly to get to know each other better and have some fun. In the past year, we've been bowling in Phoenix, made sushi in San Francisco, and toured a brewery.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. As such, you will be expected to be a manager of one.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Naturally, we offer competitive salaries and annual bonuses, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and meaningful equity compensation. We also supply you with top of the line equipment for your home office.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Finally, in a world of clunky “enterprise” software, we consider great UX and visual design to be a strategic advantage, and we need you to help us keep improving. Our track record gives our team a lot of autonomy -- this is your chance to rethink how “business solutions” should look and function, and to have fun while doing it.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><strong>The Team</strong></span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our ten person team is responsible for building products from soup to nuts. We often wear many hats and work across both the technical stack and departments. You’ll have the opportunity to work with people who have successfully launched (and sold) products. </div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Most of us choose to focus on one solution at a time.

We've designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe. Additionally, we enable Hubbers who are not based in HQ, to have the flexibility to work in ways that are most effective for them (at home, in a workspace, etc).</p><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative.

We&nbsp;work&nbsp;with customers across a number of sectors, including e-commerce, media, healthcare, and&nbsp;fintech. The infrastructures we manage support millions of pounds of transactions every month.</p><p>Working with other Scale Factory colleagues, you'll help to build and support customers' platforms, working with their engineers to put together a foundation of good DevOps practise, helping them move faster, maintain uptime, and keep their secrets safe and secure.</p><p>Most of our work centres around ReadyScale, our platform design for scalable cloud infrastructure. This is currently built mainly from Terraform, Puppet, AWS and Ruby.</p><p><strong>Teams</strong></p><p>Our <em>Platform Engineering</em> team works on ReadyScale, adding features, fixing bugs, and deploying it to our customers.</p><p>Our <em>Customer Engineering</em> team supports and maintains deployed ReadyScale platforms for our customers, rolling out security patches and deploying platform improvements as well as keeping on top of support queries.</p><p>We're hiring for both teams right now, and if you're not sure where you'd fit best, that's fine -&nbsp;we rotate people through the teams from time to time. Everyone takes part in the out-of-hours on call rota, even the directors!</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Attitude, flexibility, and the ability to learn new technologies quickly, are all more important than years of experience. However you'll need production experience with:</p><ul><li>AWS</li><li>Linux (either CentOS or Ubuntu)</li><li>Configuration management (preferably Puppet, but a CM mindset is more important than the specific tool)</li></ul><p>Experience with the following would also be beneficial, but not required: Jenkins, Terraform, Packer, ELK, Vagrant, Prometheus, Docker, Kubernetes. As dictated by client requirements, we work with a number of different language environments&nbsp;and application frameworks. We even have one customer still running COBOL.</p><p>Honestly, if you're not sure if you have the relevant experience for this job, get in touch anyway and we'll figure it out together.</p><p><strong>Other</strong></p><p>The salary range listed here is indicative - we'll make you an offer based on your location and experience.</p><p>We're not looking to work with&nbsp;recruiters&nbsp;to fill this role.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About The Scale Factory            </h2>            <div><p>The Scale Factory is a growing London-based consultancy. We design, build, operate, support and scale Linux infrastructure for clients of various sizes, across a number of business sectors.</p><p>We have an office near London Bridge, but we support remote working as long as you're within the UK; we encourage our team to make their own schedule with the hours that work best for them. That said, client visits (mostly London, but sometimes further afield) will occasionally be necessary, and some client engagements will influence the hours you'll need to be available - but most are pretty flexible around this too.</p><p>As well as monthly co-working days (one in London, one in Manchester), we bring the whole team together every couple of months for planning sessions, hack days, and socialising. We try to ensure that our social time is balanced and inclusive: we'll sometimes play board games in the office instead of just defaulting to&nbsp;a visit to the pub (though we do that from time to time too!)</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 25 days holiday per year                            </div>                            <div>                                 High spec Macbook or Thinkpad                            </div>                            <div>                                 Budget for conference attendance (incl. international travel)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Culture of inclusivity                            </div>                            <div>                                 Group life protection &amp; critical illness cover scheme                            </div>                            <div>                                 Mixture of on-site and remote work                            </div>                            <div>                                 Friendly colleagues, with a wealth of experience to share                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible working hours to suit you                            </div>                            <div>                                 Training and development opportunities                            </div>                    ",

We aim to provide satisfying challenges and a positive working environment because we want happy, productive employees who will be with us for many years.</p><p>We are willing to have you join us as a contractor or an employee depending on your availability and preference. Compensation is negotiable and based on your experience and skillset. If you're a headhunter or an agency, please propose specific candidates along with the associated costs.

For subscription companies, this is a HUGE problem. Left untreated, it can cause more than 50% of a company's churn. Left poorly-treated, customers face poor billing experiences, and companies lose good customers to bad process.</div><div><br></div><div>We currently integrate with companies who use Stripe, and Stripe Subscriptions. You're going to help us expand to integrate with every payment system in the world. And not only that, you're going to make it easy, and fast, for those customers to start printing money with Churn Buster.</div><div><br></div><div>Building on a fully-rearchitected platform, integrations are easy, despite the fact that you'll often be integrating with legacy technology.

You love how fast you can move with it, but you also know when to head in the opposite direction of the Rails way. Using POROs, Rails Engines, and event publication/subscribing doesn't scare you, and you see the benefits when working with a large codebase.</div><div><br></div><div>At the same time, you know where to draw the line. Working for a small company, you know how important growth is, and you work to identify 80% solutions to close loops, and move on to the next challenging problem to solve.</div><div><br></div><div>You've worked heavily with APIs and Webhooks in the past. You understand idempotency, error handling, race conditions, and you've witnessed first-hand what can go wrong when careful planning doesn't go into system architecture.</div><div><br></div><div>You write unit tests with RSpec, and request specs too. But you don't overcomplicate the codebase in the name of faster tests.</div><div><br></div><div>You love writing documentation so that customers, teammates, and future-you don't have to use those darn brains to figure-out already solved problems.</div><div><br></div><div>And you're not afraid to hop on the phone with leads/customers to help ensure they're integration/experience is going smoothly.</div><div><br></div><div><b>We're at our best when we're solving hard problems for customers, and you take pride in being a part of that.</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>--</b></div><div><b>Your responsibilities at Churn Buster:</b></div><ul><li>Add new payment processor integrations</li><li>Improve existing integrations</li><li>Simplify/speed up onboarding for all integrations</li><li>Work with our customers' engineering teams when they need help</li><li>Write documentation regularly for recurring confusion points</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Requirements/Experience:</b></div><ul><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Sidekiq/Background workers</li><li>OOP/POROs</li><li>APIs</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Heroku/Review Apps</li><li>Git</li><li>RSpec</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Bonus Points:</b></div><ul><li>Payment-related APIs: Stripe, Braintree, etc</li><li>Sinatra</li><li>SQL (knowing when to not use ActiveRecord)</li><li>Component based Rails applications/Wisper</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>About the Job:</b></div><ul><li>Full-Time</li><li>100% Remote (US Pacific Time preferred, California even better - time zone is important since we'll be pairing frequently)</li><li>Unlimited Vacation</li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Email <a href='mailto:matt@churnbuster.io' rel='nofollow'>matt@churnbuster.io</a> and share why you think you're the perfect fit for the next chapter at Churn Buster.
