Whether you need items delivered to a jobsite, don't have time to stop at the store, or simply crave donuts from across town, we can get it to you.</p><p>THE ROLE</p><p>You’ll be one of the first members of the engineering team and will be influential in the technical direction of the platform as we grow.  This is a high responsibility, high autonomy position and you’ll be deploying code to production within the first day or two.  You’ll be encouraged to propose features and functionality as the platform continues to mature.</p><p>We believe that product development is more fun when deploying early and often, splitting up work into bite-sized chunks and getting feedback from real users as quickly as possible.  We also believe that a single engineer should be empowered to develop a feature from start to finish, and that the technology stack should be simple enough to make that realistic.</p><p>WHAT YOU’LL DO</p><p>- Design and write well-structured, easily maintainable, and thoroughly tested code</p><p>- Participate in code reviews to ensure quality and consistency in the codebase, and to keep the team aligned</p><p>- Deploy your projects to production frequently and monitor the results to ensure quality and positive outcome</p><p>- Accept feedback from customers and adapt solutions with an eye for usability</p><p>- Work with the rest of the product team to come up with ways to make the product better overall</p><p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</p><p>- Experience building and supporting web applications in a full-stack capacity</p><p>- Proficiency with Ruby on Rails or Javascript/React, and with an interest in getting your hands dirty on both backend and frontend</p><p>- A desire to dig into new technologies and learn as you go</p><p>- Bonus: React Native, iOS, Android, ElasticSearch, Google Maps APIs</p><p>Reach out to me at peter.cullen@dispatchwithus.com if you're interested!<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Teams practice scrum, work in sprints, calculate velocity, do code reviews and rely on Continuous Integration.</li><li><strong>Location Independence</strong>. Remote work is built into our company’s DNA. Half of our developers are remote!&nbsp; <em>Note that we are currently not accepting applications from outside of the United States.</em></li><li><strong>Craftsmanship</strong>. We have excellent engineers spanning all skill levels, and we are all committed to becoming better at our craft. We practice Lunch &amp; Learns,mentorship, and pair programming.</li><li><strong>Stewardship</strong>. We are big proponents of open source, use it a lot, and give back to the community wherever we can.</li></ul><p>Our 17 year old codebase is constantly evolving to incorporate modern technologies. We started with Java, moved into JRuby on Rails leveraging the Java code with JRuby, and are now incorporating React where it makes sense. We use RSpec for testing Ruby and Java, and Jest for JavaScript.</p><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><p>We care about our people, and as such are strong believers in having fun at work, continuing education and work/life/family balance. We demonstrate that in the followings ways:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Competitive Pay</strong>.

RealPage continues reinventing and evolving to meet the needs of the customers we serve through technology and vision. You can feel it in the work we do and the clients that benefit. Our unique company philosophy fosters innovation, excellence and collaboration. Employees are encouraged to take risks and work on projects and products that the market has never seen before.</p><p><br>We value personality and fit as much as we value the engineering ability and technical expertise. We want to keep our work environment positive, helpful and collaborative. &nbsp;We are looking for pragmatists, and people who can empathize with users and team members.<br><br>You must demonstrate strong skills in either Rails, Java, or React. While we don’t expect you to know all of the above, you should at least be very proficient at one or more of these. Almost all of our engineers are full-stack, so you must be willing to branch out and master different levels of the technology stack. You will be expected to code with Rails, Java and React. <br><br>A minimum of 2 years of professional development experience is required. &nbsp;You should demonstrate the ability to understand and develop requirements, and produce elegant, extensible object-oriented code (you will be tested on this).<br><br>You should also be familiar with various automated testing principles and techniques.

There’s no micromanaging here.</li><li>A great communicator: we’re big on teaching, learning, debating, and explaining, and these things require clear, deliberate communication.</li><li>Wary of bullet lists with more than 3 items in job postings: we aren’t heavily process-oriented or believe in tons of structure, and if your eyes have glazed over while reading this list, you might just fit right in.</li></ul><p>You’re likely more awesome than you think, so please apply even if you only check a few of these boxes.</p><p><strong>Interested?</strong></p><p>Woohoo! To apply, send us a blurb about who you are and what you’re into to devjob_q4_2017@buysellads.com. If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on what you like to build, things you’ve built in the past that you’re proud of, and what you’d like to be building now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</p><p>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straight-forward: we do an initial meet-and-greet phone screen, a live pair-coding session over Slack (our primary mode of communication), and a take-home coding test. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess. (For reference, in our last hiring round in the summer we responded to 100% of direct applicants and the average response time to an applicant was under 24 hours. The average time from initial contact to us extending an offer was 11 days.)</p><p>And if we are the right fit for each other? Awesome! Come build a platform to help fix advertising with us.</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> 100% remote team, high-impact role on a strong engineering team</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

Here is some of what you can expect working here:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>. Developers are organized into autonomous teams of 2-4 developers and have a lot of control over how they collaborate, communicate, and work in general.</li><br><li><strong>Agility</strong>. Teams practice scrum, work in sprints, calculate velocity, do code reviews and rely on Continuous Integration.</li><br><li><strong>Location Independence</strong>. Remote work is built into our company’s DNA. Half of our developers are remote!</li><br><li><strong>Craftsmanship</strong>. We have excellent engineers spanning all skill levels, and we are all committed to becoming better at our craft. We practice Lunch &amp; Learns,mentorship, and pair programming.</li><br><li><strong>Stewardship</strong>. We are big proponents of open source, use it a lot, and give back to the community wherever we can.</li><br></ul><br><p>Our 17 year old codebase is constantly evolving to incorporate modern technologies. We started with Java, moved into JRuby on Rails leveraging the Java code with JRuby, and are now incorporating React where it makes sense. We use RSpec for testing Ruby and Java, and Jest for JavaScript.</p><br><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><br><p>We care about our people, and as such are strong believers in having fun at work, continuing education and work/life/family balance. We demonstrate that in the followings ways:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong><strong>Competitive Pay</strong>. We hire excellent people and reward them accordingly.</strong></li><br><li><strong>One Paid Conference</strong> per year (including hotel and airfare).</li><br><li><strong>DashCon.</strong> An internal yearly conference showcasing our engineering culture.</li><br><li><strong>10% time per week</strong> to invest in open source or self-education.</li><br><li><strong>Work from anywhere</strong> in any timezone.</li><br><li><strong>Great benefits</strong>.

RealPage continues reinventing and evolving to meet the needs of the customers we serve through technology and vision. You can feel it in the work we do and the clients that benefit. Our unique company philosophy fosters innovation, excellence and collaboration. Employees are encouraged to take risks and work on projects and products that the market has never seen before.</p><br><p><br>We value personality and fit as much as we value the engineering ability and technical expertise. We want to keep our work environment positive, helpful and collaborative. &nbsp;We are looking for pragmatists, and people who can empathize with users and team members.<br><br>You must demonstrate strong skills in either Rails, Java, or React. While we don’t expect you to know all of the above, you should at least be very proficient at one or more of these. Almost all of our engineers are full-stack, so you must be willing to branch out and master different levels of the technology stack. You will be expected to code with Rails, Java and React. <br><br>A minimum of 2 years of professional development experience is required. &nbsp;You should demonstrate the ability to understand and develop requirements, and produce elegant, extensible object-oriented code (you will be tested on this).<br><br>You should also be familiar with various automated testing principles and techniques.

We aim to provide satisfying challenges and a positive working environment because we want happy, productive employees who will be with us for many years.</p><p>We are willing to have you join us as a contractor or an employee depending on your availability and preference. Compensation is negotiable and based on your experience and skillset. If you're a headhunter or an agency, please propose specific candidates along with the associated costs.

There are only twenty of us, so you are getting in at a time when we need people who can help us build a path towards the future.<br>We believe that empowered, engaged employees do the best work. We’ll be giving you the tools you need to succeed and looking to you for suggestions for improvement not just in your daily job, but in many other aspects of building a company. Whether you work from our main office in San Francisco, or you are a remote employee, we’ll be working together a lot - particularly, pairing and collaborating - we want you to succeed! We don’t want you to work too hard (burnout is real), and we do want to encourage you to grow (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome' rel='nofollow'>impostor syndrome</a> is also real) - and we’ll help you do that.<br>Netlify is devoted to building a team of people with different backgrounds and lifestyles.

If you live in San Francisco, we usually substitute this call with a visit to our office. This first meeting helps us to learn more about your past experience and helps you to learn a little bit more about our company and how we work.<br><br>If we move forward with the process, we will work together in designing a test to evaluate your technical skills. We’ll invite you to join a dedicated Slack channel where we can reach each other and talk about the test.<br><br>If the test is successful, we’ll schedule a next meeting with other members of the company that you’ll be working with, directly or indirectly.<br><br>After this third interview, you’ll meet with the management team to discuss salary and other compensations.</li></ul></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",
