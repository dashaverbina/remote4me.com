It started slow -- just one notification at first. Then two, three.. Before long, there were dozens. Our error reporting tool was connected to Slack, and these notifications meant something was wrong. Seriously wrong.</span></p><p><span>I stopped the email reply I was typing mid-sentence and switched over to Slack. I had a look at the growing error log, now over two scrollbar lengths deep, and pinged my CTO. He was already on it. It wasn’t long before we figured out what the problem was: our bank connection was down.</span></p><p><span>Several frantic phone calls and meetings later, we found out why: the bank’s executive team had met and decided they no longer wanted to do business with us. Not only did this violate the agreement we’d signed just a few weeks prior, we received zero prior notice. Now our phones were ringing off the hook with disappointed startup founders who could no longer process card payments through their online stores.</span></p><p><span>Three years later, and I still remember this scenario like it was yesterday. Today, I’m the CEO of Verify. Our mission is to usher in the decentralized financial future; a future where banks don’t decide who can and can’t participate in the economy. Our long-term plan to achieve this vision starts off with a native value transfer solution called Verify Payments. </span></p><p><strong>About Verify Payments</strong></p><p><span>Verify Payments is an API-based solution that enables instant, low cost bank transfers anywhere in the world. We’re a small team that moves fast, with an ambitious plan to offer efficient real-time transfer of value, both locally and internationally. We operate 100% remotely.</span></p><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><p><span>Things we’re looking for:</span></p><ol><li><span>You love to learn</span></li><li><span>You can’t resist a good challenge</span></li><li><span>You get results</span></li></ol><p><span>Give us examples of situations you’ve been through that demonstrate these 3 things. While we don’t require a fixed number of years of experience, we care about your track record.</span></p><p><strong>When applying, remember:</strong></p><ol><li><em><span>Show, don’t tell</span></em><span>. Action speaks louder than words -- and we want to see what you’ve built. Share your Github, demo links and live applications.</span></li><li><em><span>Demonstrate results</span></em><span>. Tell us about what you’ve done, not what you’d do.</span></li></ol><p><span>We haven't said much about how we work because you're going to be the first full-time technical hire at the company. You'll be shaping the processes that future hires will follow.</span></p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Verify            </h2>            <div><p> We're a small, funded team and&nbsp;we're growing quickly!</p><p>You'll be working with:</p><p>- <strong>Yazin Alirhayim, CEO</strong>: Yazin previously started White Payments, later acquired by an Amazon subsidiary.

    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Lead Code Whisperer with Rails and/or .NET experience </h2>      <h4>Posted Feb 14</h4>    <h3>      <span>Corgibytes, LLC</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: Richmond, VA</span><br>        <a href='http://corgibytes.com' rel='nofollow'>http://corgibytes.com</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>What Chip and Joanna do for houses, we do for code! We love finding fixer-upper apps that provide amazing business value but need some remodeling. We're also a women-owned business and 66% of our leadership team are women.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our main focus is on making software applications more stable, scalable, and secure. We call this &quot;software remodeling&quot; and we approach our work through the lens of these core values:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Act With Empathy</b><span>: Listening and understanding&nbsp;</span>is<span>&nbsp;at the very heart of our culture. Consider the people who are impacted by your work: your clients, your users, your teammates, and even your future self.</span><br></li><li><b>Adopt a Growth Mindset</b><span>: Constantly find ways to expand your knowledge and learn new things. Your intelligence and talent are not fixed; they're developed over time through perseverance, dedication, and hard work.</span><br></li><li><b>Calm the Chaos</b>: Urgency leads to errors; frenzy to frustration. We focus on developing the steady working rhythm and calm mind that works best for solving complex problems.</li><li><b>Communication is Just as Important as Code:</b> No one at Corgibytes identifies themselves as a “technical” or “non-technical” because everyone is both. Practice both types of skills regularly.</li><li><b>Craftsmanship in Context:</b> Match your solution to the situation. Sometimes it’s a quick and dirty prototype to prove a concept. When the stakes are high, spending extra time getting it right is the best way to go.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Sound like you? Awesome! That's a great sign because we live these values every day. They’re a guide in making decisions, no matter how small. They’ve helped us develop a culture where folks are autonomous, responsible, and work hard without feeling burned out or like they have to choose between family and work. We’re the type of company where it’s common to see a toddler bouncing on a knee during a meeting. As an intentionally distributed team, we focus more on results than micromanagement. Our core values are key to our culture, as are our pillars of autonomy, balance, diversity, </span>and<span>&nbsp;trust.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>What Corgibytes Does<br></b></div><div><span>There’s a lot of existing code out there that needs to be modernized safely. We specialize in this and have even coined a new term — software remodeling — to describe what we do. In general, we focus on activities that make software more stable, scalable, and secure, which can often blend traditional development with more DevOps and consulting activities (ex: teaching our clients how to write good acceptance tests using Gherkin). In general, we refactor, introduce or improve test coverage, break up monolithic apps, upgrade frameworks in any language, framework or platform. The best part for you? You'll get to solve lots of really interesting engineering challenges!</span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>About The Role<br></b></div><div><span>We've got some projects coming down the pike and we're looking for some seasoned full-stack developers who enjoy working with existing codebases to make them better. We're particularly looking for folks who have solid skills with Rails&nbsp;</span>and/or .<span>NET. This will be a contractor position and part-time is okay.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here's a question: does </span>reconstructing<span> a database from the binary files without any documentation sound like a fun challenge? If so, you've got the right attitude! Most of the folks on our team identify as &quot;menders&quot; (as opposed to makers). Given the choice, they'd rather fix bugs, pay down technical debt, and work on support tickets instead of doing exploratory features. Many of our clients come to us with complex architectural problems and can't find the talent anywhere else. As a Lead Code Whisperer, you can work directly with a client to help them migrate platforms, address security vulnerabilities, integrate with obscure systems, and more. You love a challenge and can understand and articulate the business value of technical choices.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If a project requires a stack you haven’t used before, your instinct is to become eager, not intimidated. You regularly practice writing clean code with Test-Driven Development and document your rationale. You stay up-to-date with industry best practices and maybe you're even starting to contribute your thoughts through blogs, StackOverflow, presentations, etc. You are a mentor who loves helping other developers grow in their careers. You enjoy pair programming and take pride in giving solid feedback through pull requests and code reviews.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><div><b><span>Salary &amp; Benefits<br></span></b></div><div><span>We're currently looking for 1-2 contractors to add to our team. Our current rate for contractors is&nbsp;</span><span>$74.48/hour, which might seem a little odd, but here's how we got at such a specific number.&nbsp;</span><span>We started with an annual salary of $110k/year. Next, we divided that by 1920 (48 weeks/year at 40 hours per week - we assume you’d take 4 weeks per year off) and add 30% to compensate for contractor expenses (using your own equipment, paying your own health insurance, self-employment taxes, etc.).</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Other benefits include:</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>Work where and when you want. We're a fully distributed team.&nbsp;</li><li>Lots of autonomy and self-organizing teams.</li><li>10% of your billable time accrues for professional development<br></li><li>Yoga/mindfulness classes</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>At this point, you're probably thinking something like, &quot;This job description really speaks to me, but I've never heard of Corgibytes. How do I know they're legit and learn more about them?&quot; No worries, my friend. We get that our business is a little under the radar as opposed to consumer apps, so here are some podcasts and articles you can check out to learn more about us and the work we do.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li><b>Software Engineering Daily&nbsp;</b>(https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/11/07/legacy-code-with-andrea-goulet/)<br></li><li><b>Hanselminutes&nbsp;</b>(https://www.hanselminutes.com/539/learning-to-love-legacy-code-with-andrea-goulet-from-corgibytes)</li><li><b>First Round Review&nbsp;</b>(http://firstround.com/review/forget-technical-debt-heres-how-to-build-technical-wealth/)</li><li><b>NASDAQ CTO Summit&nbsp;</b>(https://www.facebook.com/NASDAQ/videos/10154583234682429/)</li><li><b>LinkedIn Next Wave</b> - Our CEO, Andrea, was listed as one of the &quot;Top 10 Professionals in Software under 35&quot; (https://lists.linkedin.com/2016/next-wave-top-professionals-35-and-under-20161011#)</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We're really excited about the work we're doing.

    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Senior Back-End Engineer</h2>      <h4>Posted Feb  1</h4>    <h3>      <span>Logikcull</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: San Francisco (Open to Remote) </span><br>        <a href='https://logikcull.com/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://logikcull.com/jobs/</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>You’ve of course heard of Dropbox. You probably use it or a similar service on a daily basis. Now imagine a service where users upload entire email databases, zip files, images, hard drives of content, and pretty much anything they need to search through. Simple enough. That’s what S3 is for, right? But here’s the catch, unlike Dropbox and similar services, Logikcull’s job is to rip the data apart, analyze the hell out of it, and then organize it into logical search buckets so that legal teams around the world can easily and quickly sift through it.</div><div><br></div><div>This of course requires massive computing, massive storage, and an ever expanding infrastructure to support them all. Our challenges are a unique mix of broad and deep because the data we need to get at is always mixed up with other data. Emails have attachments, word documents wrap human-readable content in data structures and almost anything can be printed to PDF. Our system has to be smart enough to recognize everything in order to unpack it properly, graceful enough to remember complex relationships between documents and fast enough to rip through gigabytes concurrently at scale.</div><div><br></div><div>And all of this needs to happen at scale, for all of our customers (in 34 different countries and growing),&nbsp;<strong>within minutes or hours from the first upload</strong>. Insane, right?</div><div><br></div><div>It’s controlled chaos at scale and we love it. And here’s why:</div><div><br></div><div>The technical challenges are staggering. And that’s usually enough to keep a top engineer happy for quite some time. But it’s the impact Logikcull is having on our society that is even more rewarding. For instance, governments can now turn around open records requests (i.e. FOIA), within days by using Logikcull. Prior to Logikcull, this process used to take weeks, months, and, we’re not kidding, years, to complete. Blocking government information to citizens lawfully requesting that information is counter to a healthy democracy.</div><div><br></div><div>Another example where Logikcull is having an impact on our society is litigation. To us, litigation can be a means to affect positive change (<a href='http://logikcull.com/blog/into-the-wild-earthjustice-amanda-sharp/' rel='nofollow'>see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves, not a joke</a>) and it allows people of all means to get access to justice. But getting access to justice also means being able to afford litigation. And one of the biggest costs to litigation is sifting through data (i.e. discovery or e-discovery). Logikcull makes it easy, fast, and affordable for anyone to sift through data for litigation, which means that citizens and businesses can not only get access to justice, but also save a ton of money - in some cases, millions of dollars are saved by using Logikcull. For a business, the cost savings can be pumped back into the business for growth, employee benefits, and more.</div><div><br></div><div>This is why we do what we do. And the positive team-focused engineering culture at Logikcull makes working on these massive problems even more rewarding. If this is something you would like to be a part of, we’d love to hear from you.</div><div><br></div><div>Our current stack includes: Rails, Backbone + Marionette, MySQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch, all running in AWS.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Job Responsibilities</strong><br></div><ul><li>You will take ownership within our codebase, writing, maintaining clean, modular code.</li><li>You are able to take a design/proposal and carry it through to a thoughtful and polished end result with good test coverage.</li><li>You will support our amazing Customer Success team in helping diagnose/explain user-reported bugs and fix existing bugs.</li><li>You will review code written by other engineers and provide useful and honest feedback.</li><li>You will help with architecting solutions to scale our proprietary data processing platform for 10x, 100x, and beyond. &nbsp;</li><li>You will participate in on-call rotations and work effectively and collaboratively during site outages.</li></ul><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Job Requirements</strong><br></div><ul><li>You have 4+ years of experience in the Ruby language in a production environment.</li><li>You have a good understanding of highly distributed processing systems.</li><li>You are comfortable navigating through complex data structures and algorithms, and have a strong desire to produce optimal code for speed and efficiency.</li><li>You are familiar with the basics of scalable software design and architecture.</li><li>[Bonus] You have experience with Elasticsearch and/or other search technologies.</li><li>[Bonus] You have experience with MongoDB and/or other NoSQL technologies.</li><li>[Bonus] You have a solid understanding of file formats, particularly document formats, e.g. (MS Word, Excel, Outlook, Acrobat, Etc...).</li><li>You have excellent communication skills and the willingness to share your expertise.</li><li>You are pragmatic and sensible in your approach to problem solving.</li><li>You are able to think critically and gather data to constructively support your position.</li></ul><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Our Culture&nbsp;</strong><br></div><ul><li>Engineers at Logikcull are highly technical, independent, and self organized.

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of our Rails and API team that is responsible for building and maintaining our API that drives our mobile applications, as well as working to help us expand our rapidly growing web-app.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned Rubyist and have a solid knowledge of Rails</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Postgres, Heroku, modern JS and CSS frameworks.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and sick leave.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a Ruby gem, or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote working                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible hours                            </div>                            <div>                                 Large amounts of autonomy                            </div>                            <div>                                 Great pay, insurance, benfits                            </div>                    ",

Whether you need items delivered to a jobsite, don't have time to stop at the store, or simply crave donuts from across town, we can get it to you.</p><p>THE ROLE</p><p>You’ll be one of the first members of the engineering team and will be influential in the technical direction of the platform as we grow.  This is a high responsibility, high autonomy position and you’ll be deploying code to production within the first day or two.  You’ll be encouraged to propose features and functionality as the platform continues to mature.</p><p>We believe that product development is more fun when deploying early and often, splitting up work into bite-sized chunks and getting feedback from real users as quickly as possible.  We also believe that a single engineer should be empowered to develop a feature from start to finish, and that the technology stack should be simple enough to make that realistic.</p><p>WHAT YOU’LL DO</p><p>- Design and write well-structured, easily maintainable, and thoroughly tested code</p><p>- Participate in code reviews to ensure quality and consistency in the codebase, and to keep the team aligned</p><p>- Deploy your projects to production frequently and monitor the results to ensure quality and positive outcome</p><p>- Accept feedback from customers and adapt solutions with an eye for usability</p><p>- Work with the rest of the product team to come up with ways to make the product better overall</p><p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</p><p>- Experience building and supporting web applications in a full-stack capacity</p><p>- Proficiency with Ruby on Rails or Javascript/React, and with an interest in getting your hands dirty on both backend and frontend</p><p>- A desire to dig into new technologies and learn as you go</p><p>- Bonus: React Native, iOS, Android, ElasticSearch, Google Maps APIs</p><p>Reach out to me at peter.cullen@dispatchwithus.com if you're interested!<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

We want to keep our work environment positive, helpful and collaborative. &nbsp;We are looking for pragmatists, and people who can empathize with users and team members.<br><br>You must demonstrate strong skills in either Rails, Java, or React. While we don’t expect you to know all of the above, you should at least be very proficient at one or more of these.
