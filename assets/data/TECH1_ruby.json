If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on what you like to build, things you’ve built in the past that you’re proud of, and what you’d like to be building now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straightforward: we do an initial meet-and-greet phone screen, a live pair-coding session over Slack (our primary mode of communication), and a short take-home coding test.

Whether it’s with customers, employees, or a target market, SurveyMonkey helps curious individuals and companies — including 99% of the Fortune 500 — have conversations at scale with the people who matter most. It’s People Powered Data that allows them to understand not only “what” is happening, but “why.” SurveyMonkey’s 700+ employees throughout North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are dedicated to powering the curious.</p><h5>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</h5><p>SurveyMonkey’s platform is used for a myriad of purposes across a broad spectrum of industries. That leaves ample opportunity to build targeted products that solve a specific problem. That’s where our team comes in. We’re responsible for building standalone solutions that address the needs of businesses.</p><p>So far, we’ve built three:</p><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement</li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Publish 3rd-party verified customer proof </li></ul><p>We operate each product as a small startup within the larger SurveyMonkey organization. This affords us flexibility to quickly try new ideas, but with the resources of larger company. Our goal is to build high growth, profitable businesses that leverage the enormous user base of SurveyMonkey.</p><h5>The Team</h5><p>Our small team is responsible for building products from soup to nuts. We wear many hats and span both the technical stack and departments. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside colleagues who have successfully launched and sold numerous products.</p><p>Most of us choose to focus on one solution at a time. We feel this allows us to fully embrace and understand our customer needs and develop a deep technical understanding of the problem domain. However, we are also committed to sharing our work - not just with each other, but via open source contributions.</p><h5>Who We’re Looking For</h5><p>We’re looking for a mid-level or senior developer with a deep understanding of all aspects of the web application stack. You should care about the quality of your code, user experience, and how your choices impact the business as a whole. You need to be able to evaluate tradeoffs and make decisions.</p><p>Our team has been building Rails applications for over ten years. That experience has solidified our belief that the default Rails stack is the single best way to build web applications.  While we shy away from complexity (like front end frameworks), we are quick to embrace tools that give us leverage (ActionCable, Turbolinks) or improve developer happiness (ES6, Webpacker).</p><p>If this mindset speaks to you, please include a cover letter along with your resume to introduce yourself. Our team puts a lot of stock in written communication. Plus, we’d appreciate a sense of your personality.</p><h5>Why Work Here?</h5><p>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific time zone by at least four hours, where you live and work is up to you. You will be asked to travel a few times a year for a full team meeting. We use this time not only for larger planning discussions, but also for a little social interaction. In the past year, we’ve gone bowling in Phoenix and made sushi in San Francisco.</p><p>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. If you consider yourself to be a manager of one, this role is a great fit.</p><p>We offer competitive salaries, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and equity compensation.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

I work extremely fast so I expect as much from our lead engineer. I value execution much more than perfection.</code></pre>Salary range: 90-120k USD with possibility of significant equity after 6 months.

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Toronto, ON or Anywhere)</strong> </p><p>Do you get excited about scaling, securing, and maintaining systems, so that our clients and our team have the tools they need, when they need them? Does troubleshooting, tinkering, and designing solutions to improve and monitor performance get you out of bed in the morning? Do you love to develop new features and build new products for a growing organization that makes a difference in people’s lives? Precision Nutrition is looking for an experienced developer who doesn’t just have a passion for building killer features, but also cares about maintaining and improving the overall health of our platform and infrastructure.</p><h2>Who You Are</h2><p>You balance the demands of product development, with the need to scale our growing user base. You can work anywhere in the stack: you mess with javascript for breakfast, write a new RESTful API endpoint in Rails for a mid-morning snack, tune a query in Postgres for lunch, and write an Ansible cookbook for dinner. You share our belief that every developer takes ownership of our production environment and isn’t above operations work.</p><p>We know this is a tall order and requires a special person to do it right. If this sounds intriguing to you, read on.</p><h2>What You Get to Do</h2><p><strong>Ruby/Rails API development.</strong> Our coaching platform is backed by a RESTful API implemented in Rails. You’ll spend a lot of your time building, testing, and working with Rails. We’re using Elixir and Phoenix too, so come prepared to learn!</p><p><strong>Ember.</strong> Our front-end devs are focused on working with our suite of Ember, user-facing applications - but it really helps if you can see the big picture and understand our stack front to back. That means learning Ember.js and Ember Data. Don’t worry - you’ll have lots of help. We’ve got a team of Ember experts to show you the ropes.</p><p><strong>DevOps.</strong> You’ll write reliable, scripted means of deploying code and system changes (today we use Ansible, yet we’re open to trying new tools). You’ll maintain provisioning and continuous integration systems, keep system software up to date, and ensure code can be deployed and rolled back easily and reliably, while making sure backups are behaving, and security best practices are being followed.</p><p><strong>Monitor performance.</strong>You’ll design and execute performance tests on our website and other applications, as well as recommend and implement system and application performance best practices.</p><p><strong>Maintain our systems.</strong> You’ll monitor the health of all systems, participate in our on-call rotation team, and respond to, and escalate infrastructure issues. You’ll perform regular and ad hoc sysadmin tasks on all shared systems, and manage Amazon Web Services and other hosting service providers. You’ll schedule and manage site downtime, and work with the team to proactively add infrastructure so that our clients and team have the best experience possible.</p><h2>Our Ideal Candidate</h2><p><strong>Is experienced.</strong> You have at least 5 years of experience in a Development or DevOps role in an Agile environment. You know, or are excited to learn, Ruby on Rails, Ember, and maybe even some Elixir/Phoenix, as well as the usual tools of the trade: Amazon Web Services such as EC2, S3 and RDS, Ansible, Vagrant, Linux, PostgreSQL, Continuous Integration, and Redis.</p><p><strong>Is on the cutting edge.</strong> In your spare time, you research and stay up to date on the latest and greatest best practices, systems, and tools.</p><p><strong>Likes variety.</strong> You'll be wrangling all kinds of systems, apps, and technologies - everything from our Wordpress-based sales sites to our modern Ember/Rails based coaching platform and our next generation Elixir based payment processing system.</p><p><strong>Can easily switch gears.</strong> You have the ability to prioritize and re-prioritize your work in a changing environment - you understand that things change as new information is made available. You don’t mind managing multiple projects and have the ability to have a few balls up in the air at one time.</p><p><strong>Cares.</strong> You take care of our data and systems like they are your very own.</p><p><strong>Is self-motivated and can work independently.</strong> Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction. You are highly organized and always eager to learn more and share with the team.</p><p><strong>Leaves their ego at the door.</strong> You have integrity, talent, are outgoing, have a palpable excitement about the future, and don’t show it off. Shadiness, mediocrity, cynicism, and excessive &quot;constructive criticism&quot; are out.</p><p><strong>Is resilient and has a growth mindset.</strong> Part of open, honest communication is having the ability to deliver honest, direct feedback without being offensive or critical. The other part is having the ability to view honest, direct feedback as a gift you can use to get better. If you’re married to your ideas or are (even mildly) offended when they’re challenged, this probably won’t be a good fit for you.</p><p><strong>Has worked remotely.</strong> You have strong self-structure and discipline and have worked remotely either currently or in the past so you know the benefits and the challenges.</p><p><strong>Wants to be part of a purpose-driven organization.</strong>&nbsp;PN is a pretty incredible place and is committed to allowing you to do the work you love and love the work you do.</p><p>Life-changing, research-driven nutrition coaching. That's our mission at Precision Nutrition.</p><p>As an organization, we:</p><ul><li>Seek and support diversity.</li><li>Offer 4 weeks paid time-off, benefits, and the ability to work remotely.</li><li>Set you up with whatever fancy gear you need to perform at your best.</li><li>Give you the flexibility to make your own schedule.</li></ul><p>Not only that, but if you join us you can:</p><p><strong>Work in the fitness and nutrition industry. </strong> We love exercise, we love nutrition, and we love sport. That’s why we started this company. If you do too, you’ll appreciate how rare it is to find a career you really love. For active, fit people, Precision Nutrition is that opportunity.</p><p><strong>Work with fun, bright, and talented people.</strong> We’re a small company, and we’re picky about who we work with, because to us, this isn’t just a job; it’s our life.</p><p>If you or someone you know is interested please apply below.<strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Remote or Chattanooga, TN)</strong> </p><p>Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.</p><p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p><p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p><p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p><p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p><p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p><p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p><ul><li><p>React &amp; React Native</p></li><li><p>Swift &amp; Objective C</p></li><li><p>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</p></li><li><p>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</p></li><li><p>Ethereum / Solidity</p></li><li><p>Ruby on Rails</p></li><li><p>Python</p></li><li><p>Pandas</p></li><li><p>Serverless</p></li><li><p>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</p></li></ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p><p><strong>This Role: Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong></p><p>As a full-stack engineer at Very, you will work on a wide variety of projects and stacks. This job is a great fit for pragmatic polyglot programmers with a functional bend. Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects and are at the tail end of moving to Elixir for the bulk of our services. Additionally, we have a strong Python contingent who are utilizing the serverless framework for the development of highly targeted microservices / systems as well as for data science and machine learning projects.</p><p>We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.</p><p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p><p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a <a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>holacracy</a>. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to <a href='http://www.extremeprogramming.org/' rel='nofollow'>Extreme Programming</a> as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p><p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC—prices and plans vary based on your region—as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life &amp; AD&amp;D. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company’s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.</p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in the continental United States. Thanks!To apply, please send us a note to jobs-aj@verypossible.com with &quot;Sr. Software Engineer Full Stack&quot; in the subject line. Please include the following:1.

It started slow -- just one notification at first. Then two, three.. Before long, there were dozens. Our error reporting tool was connected to Slack, and these notifications meant something was wrong. Seriously wrong.</span></p><p><span>I stopped the email reply I was typing mid-sentence and switched over to Slack. I had a look at the growing error log, now over two scrollbar lengths deep, and pinged my CTO. He was already on it. It wasn’t long before we figured out what the problem was: our bank connection was down.</span></p><p><span>Several frantic phone calls and meetings later, we found out why: the bank’s executive team had met and decided they no longer wanted to do business with us. Not only did this violate the agreement we’d signed just a few weeks prior, we received zero prior notice. Now our phones were ringing off the hook with disappointed startup founders who could no longer process card payments through their online stores.</span></p><p><span>Three years later, and I still remember this scenario like it was yesterday. Today, I’m the CEO of Verify. Our mission is to usher in the decentralized financial future; a future where banks don’t decide who can and can’t participate in the economy. Our long-term plan to achieve this vision starts off with a native value transfer solution called Verify Payments. </span></p><p><strong>About Verify Payments</strong></p><p><span>Verify Payments is an API-based solution that enables instant, low cost bank transfers anywhere in the world. We’re a small team that moves fast, with an ambitious plan to offer efficient real-time transfer of value, both locally and internationally. We operate 100% remotely.</span></p><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><p><span>Things we’re looking for:</span></p><ol><li><span>You love to learn</span></li><li><span>You can’t resist a good challenge</span></li><li><span>You get results</span></li></ol><p><span>Give us examples of situations you’ve been through that demonstrate these 3 things. While we don’t require a fixed number of years of experience, we care about your track record.</span></p><p><strong>When applying, remember:</strong></p><ol><li><em><span>Show, don’t tell</span></em><span>. Action speaks louder than words -- and we want to see what you’ve built. Share your Github, demo links and live applications.</span></li><li><em><span>Demonstrate results</span></em><span>. Tell us about what you’ve done, not what you’d do.</span></li></ol><p><span>We haven't said much about how we work because you're going to be the first full-time technical hire at the company. You'll be shaping the processes that future hires will follow.</span></p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Verify            </h2>            <div><p> We're a small, funded team and&nbsp;we're growing quickly!</p><p>You'll be working with:</p><p>- <strong>Yazin Alirhayim, CEO</strong>: Yazin previously started White Payments, later acquired by an Amazon subsidiary.

    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Lead Code Whisperer with Rails and/or .NET experience </h2>      <h4>Posted Feb 14</h4>    <h3>      <span>Corgibytes, LLC</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: Richmond, VA</span><br>        <a href='http://corgibytes.com' rel='nofollow'>http://corgibytes.com</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>What Chip and Joanna do for houses, we do for code! We love finding fixer-upper apps that provide amazing business value but need some remodeling. We're also a women-owned business and 66% of our leadership team are women.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our main focus is on making software applications more stable, scalable, and secure. We call this &quot;software remodeling&quot; and we approach our work through the lens of these core values:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Act With Empathy</b><span>: Listening and understanding&nbsp;</span>is<span>&nbsp;at the very heart of our culture. Consider the people who are impacted by your work: your clients, your users, your teammates, and even your future self.</span><br></li><li><b>Adopt a Growth Mindset</b><span>: Constantly find ways to expand your knowledge and learn new things. Your intelligence and talent are not fixed; they're developed over time through perseverance, dedication, and hard work.</span><br></li><li><b>Calm the Chaos</b>: Urgency leads to errors; frenzy to frustration. We focus on developing the steady working rhythm and calm mind that works best for solving complex problems.</li><li><b>Communication is Just as Important as Code:</b> No one at Corgibytes identifies themselves as a “technical” or “non-technical” because everyone is both. Practice both types of skills regularly.</li><li><b>Craftsmanship in Context:</b> Match your solution to the situation. Sometimes it’s a quick and dirty prototype to prove a concept. When the stakes are high, spending extra time getting it right is the best way to go.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Sound like you? Awesome! That's a great sign because we live these values every day. They’re a guide in making decisions, no matter how small. They’ve helped us develop a culture where folks are autonomous, responsible, and work hard without feeling burned out or like they have to choose between family and work. We’re the type of company where it’s common to see a toddler bouncing on a knee during a meeting. As an intentionally distributed team, we focus more on results than micromanagement. Our core values are key to our culture, as are our pillars of autonomy, balance, diversity, </span>and<span>&nbsp;trust.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>What Corgibytes Does<br></b></div><div><span>There’s a lot of existing code out there that needs to be modernized safely. We specialize in this and have even coined a new term — software remodeling — to describe what we do. In general, we focus on activities that make software more stable, scalable, and secure, which can often blend traditional development with more DevOps and consulting activities (ex: teaching our clients how to write good acceptance tests using Gherkin). In general, we refactor, introduce or improve test coverage, break up monolithic apps, upgrade frameworks in any language, framework or platform. The best part for you? You'll get to solve lots of really interesting engineering challenges!</span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>About The Role<br></b></div><div><span>We've got some projects coming down the pike and we're looking for some seasoned full-stack developers who enjoy working with existing codebases to make them better. We're particularly looking for folks who have solid skills with Rails&nbsp;</span>and/or .<span>NET. This will be a contractor position and part-time is okay.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here's a question: does </span>reconstructing<span> a database from the binary files without any documentation sound like a fun challenge? If so, you've got the right attitude! Most of the folks on our team identify as &quot;menders&quot; (as opposed to makers). Given the choice, they'd rather fix bugs, pay down technical debt, and work on support tickets instead of doing exploratory features. Many of our clients come to us with complex architectural problems and can't find the talent anywhere else. As a Lead Code Whisperer, you can work directly with a client to help them migrate platforms, address security vulnerabilities, integrate with obscure systems, and more. You love a challenge and can understand and articulate the business value of technical choices.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If a project requires a stack you haven’t used before, your instinct is to become eager, not intimidated. You regularly practice writing clean code with Test-Driven Development and document your rationale. You stay up-to-date with industry best practices and maybe you're even starting to contribute your thoughts through blogs, StackOverflow, presentations, etc. You are a mentor who loves helping other developers grow in their careers. You enjoy pair programming and take pride in giving solid feedback through pull requests and code reviews.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span><br></span></b></div><div><b><span>Salary &amp; Benefits<br></span></b></div><div><span>We're currently looking for 1-2 contractors to add to our team. Our current rate for contractors is&nbsp;</span><span>$74.48/hour, which might seem a little odd, but here's how we got at such a specific number.&nbsp;</span><span>We started with an annual salary of $110k/year. Next, we divided that by 1920 (48 weeks/year at 40 hours per week - we assume you’d take 4 weeks per year off) and add 30% to compensate for contractor expenses (using your own equipment, paying your own health insurance, self-employment taxes, etc.).</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Other benefits include:</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>Work where and when you want. We're a fully distributed team.&nbsp;</li><li>Lots of autonomy and self-organizing teams.</li><li>10% of your billable time accrues for professional development<br></li><li>Yoga/mindfulness classes</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>At this point, you're probably thinking something like, &quot;This job description really speaks to me, but I've never heard of Corgibytes. How do I know they're legit and learn more about them?&quot; No worries, my friend. We get that our business is a little under the radar as opposed to consumer apps, so here are some podcasts and articles you can check out to learn more about us and the work we do.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li><b>Software Engineering Daily&nbsp;</b>(https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2016/11/07/legacy-code-with-andrea-goulet/)<br></li><li><b>Hanselminutes&nbsp;</b>(https://www.hanselminutes.com/539/learning-to-love-legacy-code-with-andrea-goulet-from-corgibytes)</li><li><b>First Round Review&nbsp;</b>(http://firstround.com/review/forget-technical-debt-heres-how-to-build-technical-wealth/)</li><li><b>NASDAQ CTO Summit&nbsp;</b>(https://www.facebook.com/NASDAQ/videos/10154583234682429/)</li><li><b>LinkedIn Next Wave</b> - Our CEO, Andrea, was listed as one of the &quot;Top 10 Professionals in Software under 35&quot; (https://lists.linkedin.com/2016/next-wave-top-professionals-35-and-under-20161011#)</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We're really excited about the work we're doing.

    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Senior Back-End Engineer</h2>      <h4>Posted Feb  1</h4>    <h3>      <span>Logikcull</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: San Francisco (Open to Remote) </span><br>        <a href='https://logikcull.com/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://logikcull.com/jobs/</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>You’ve of course heard of Dropbox. You probably use it or a similar service on a daily basis. Now imagine a service where users upload entire email databases, zip files, images, hard drives of content, and pretty much anything they need to search through. Simple enough. That’s what S3 is for, right? But here’s the catch, unlike Dropbox and similar services, Logikcull’s job is to rip the data apart, analyze the hell out of it, and then organize it into logical search buckets so that legal teams around the world can easily and quickly sift through it.</div><div><br></div><div>This of course requires massive computing, massive storage, and an ever expanding infrastructure to support them all. Our challenges are a unique mix of broad and deep because the data we need to get at is always mixed up with other data. Emails have attachments, word documents wrap human-readable content in data structures and almost anything can be printed to PDF. Our system has to be smart enough to recognize everything in order to unpack it properly, graceful enough to remember complex relationships between documents and fast enough to rip through gigabytes concurrently at scale.</div><div><br></div><div>And all of this needs to happen at scale, for all of our customers (in 34 different countries and growing),&nbsp;<strong>within minutes or hours from the first upload</strong>. Insane, right?</div><div><br></div><div>It’s controlled chaos at scale and we love it. And here’s why:</div><div><br></div><div>The technical challenges are staggering. And that’s usually enough to keep a top engineer happy for quite some time. But it’s the impact Logikcull is having on our society that is even more rewarding. For instance, governments can now turn around open records requests (i.e. FOIA), within days by using Logikcull. Prior to Logikcull, this process used to take weeks, months, and, we’re not kidding, years, to complete. Blocking government information to citizens lawfully requesting that information is counter to a healthy democracy.</div><div><br></div><div>Another example where Logikcull is having an impact on our society is litigation. To us, litigation can be a means to affect positive change (<a href='http://logikcull.com/blog/into-the-wild-earthjustice-amanda-sharp/' rel='nofollow'>see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves, not a joke</a>) and it allows people of all means to get access to justice. But getting access to justice also means being able to afford litigation. And one of the biggest costs to litigation is sifting through data (i.e. discovery or e-discovery). Logikcull makes it easy, fast, and affordable for anyone to sift through data for litigation, which means that citizens and businesses can not only get access to justice, but also save a ton of money - in some cases, millions of dollars are saved by using Logikcull. For a business, the cost savings can be pumped back into the business for growth, employee benefits, and more.</div><div><br></div><div>This is why we do what we do. And the positive team-focused engineering culture at Logikcull makes working on these massive problems even more rewarding. If this is something you would like to be a part of, we’d love to hear from you.</div><div><br></div><div>Our current stack includes: Rails, Backbone + Marionette, MySQL, MongoDB, and Elasticsearch, all running in AWS.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Job Responsibilities</strong><br></div><ul><li>You will take ownership within our codebase, writing, maintaining clean, modular code.</li><li>You are able to take a design/proposal and carry it through to a thoughtful and polished end result with good test coverage.</li><li>You will support our amazing Customer Success team in helping diagnose/explain user-reported bugs and fix existing bugs.</li><li>You will review code written by other engineers and provide useful and honest feedback.</li><li>You will help with architecting solutions to scale our proprietary data processing platform for 10x, 100x, and beyond. &nbsp;</li><li>You will participate in on-call rotations and work effectively and collaboratively during site outages.</li></ul><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Job Requirements</strong><br></div><ul><li>You have 4+ years of experience in the Ruby language in a production environment.</li><li>You have a good understanding of highly distributed processing systems.</li><li>You are comfortable navigating through complex data structures and algorithms, and have a strong desire to produce optimal code for speed and efficiency.</li><li>You are familiar with the basics of scalable software design and architecture.</li><li>[Bonus] You have experience with Elasticsearch and/or other search technologies.</li><li>[Bonus] You have experience with MongoDB and/or other NoSQL technologies.</li><li>[Bonus] You have a solid understanding of file formats, particularly document formats, e.g. (MS Word, Excel, Outlook, Acrobat, Etc...).</li><li>You have excellent communication skills and the willingness to share your expertise.</li><li>You are pragmatic and sensible in your approach to problem solving.</li><li>You are able to think critically and gather data to constructively support your position.</li></ul><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Our Culture&nbsp;</strong><br></div><ul><li>Engineers at Logikcull are highly technical, independent, and self organized.
