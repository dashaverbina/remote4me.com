Whether you need items delivered to a jobsite, don't have time to stop at the store, or simply crave donuts from across town, we can get it to you.</p><p>THE ROLE</p><p>You’ll be one of the first members of the engineering team and will be influential in the technical direction of the platform as we grow.  This is a high responsibility, high autonomy position and you’ll be deploying code to production within the first day or two.  You’ll be encouraged to propose features and functionality as the platform continues to mature.</p><p>We believe that product development is more fun when deploying early and often, splitting up work into bite-sized chunks and getting feedback from real users as quickly as possible.  We also believe that a single engineer should be empowered to develop a feature from start to finish, and that the technology stack should be simple enough to make that realistic.</p><p>WHAT YOU’LL DO</p><p>- Design and write well-structured, easily maintainable, and thoroughly tested code</p><p>- Participate in code reviews to ensure quality and consistency in the codebase, and to keep the team aligned</p><p>- Deploy your projects to production frequently and monitor the results to ensure quality and positive outcome</p><p>- Accept feedback from customers and adapt solutions with an eye for usability</p><p>- Work with the rest of the product team to come up with ways to make the product better overall</p><p>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</p><p>- Experience building and supporting web applications in a full-stack capacity</p><p>- Proficiency with Ruby on Rails or Javascript/React, and with an interest in getting your hands dirty on both backend and frontend</p><p>- A desire to dig into new technologies and learn as you go</p><p>- Bonus: React Native, iOS, Android, ElasticSearch, Google Maps APIs</p><p>Reach out to me at peter.cullen@dispatchwithus.com if you're interested!<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Half of our developers are remote!&nbsp; <em>Note that we are currently not accepting applications from outside of the United States.</em></li><li><strong>Craftsmanship</strong>. We have excellent engineers spanning all skill levels, and we are all committed to becoming better at our craft. We practice Lunch &amp; Learns,mentorship, and pair programming.</li><li><strong>Stewardship</strong>. We are big proponents of open source, use it a lot, and give back to the community wherever we can.</li></ul><p>Our 17 year old codebase is constantly evolving to incorporate modern technologies. We started with Java, moved into JRuby on Rails leveraging the Java code with JRuby, and are now incorporating React where it makes sense. We use RSpec for testing Ruby and Java, and Jest for JavaScript.</p><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><p>We care about our people, and as such are strong believers in having fun at work, continuing education and work/life/family balance. We demonstrate that in the followings ways:</p><ul><li><strong><strong>Competitive Pay</strong>.

RealPage continues reinventing and evolving to meet the needs of the customers we serve through technology and vision. You can feel it in the work we do and the clients that benefit. Our unique company philosophy fosters innovation, excellence and collaboration. Employees are encouraged to take risks and work on projects and products that the market has never seen before.</p><p><br>We value personality and fit as much as we value the engineering ability and technical expertise. We want to keep our work environment positive, helpful and collaborative. &nbsp;We are looking for pragmatists, and people who can empathize with users and team members.<br><br>You must demonstrate strong skills in either Rails, Java, or React. While we don’t expect you to know all of the above, you should at least be very proficient at one or more of these. Almost all of our engineers are full-stack, so you must be willing to branch out and master different levels of the technology stack. You will be expected to code with Rails, Java and React. <br><br>A minimum of 2 years of professional development experience is required. &nbsp;You should demonstrate the ability to understand and develop requirements, and produce elegant, extensible object-oriented code (you will be tested on this).<br><br>You should also be familiar with various automated testing principles and techniques.

We are looking for backend Ruby on Rails developers to help shape and take part in the process.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About us</b></div><div><br></div><div>Conferize is on a mission to enable anyone to gather a community, share knowledge and create change. So we’re building a universal and social event solution to help event makers create the biggest impact. Without fuss or big budgets. Why? Because we need to meet.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>How We Work</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div></div><div>At Conferize we&nbsp;strive to cultivate a multicultural environment where work, socializing and personal development go hand in hand.&nbsp;<span>We invest in people who are driven and motivated</span><span>&nbsp;and believe in changing the status quo. We love creative thinkers and selfstarters,&nbsp;who&nbsp;never wait to be told what to do.</span></div><div><br></div><div>We believe in a&nbsp;flat bottom-up organization of work where culture trumps policy. We have little-to-no ‘middle layer’, as our&nbsp;team work semi-autonomously and leadership is semi-internalized.&nbsp;We’re 100 % product-driven, operating with a zero bug policy and exceptional product design; how things look, how they work and how they’re built.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Like us you’re ambitious and professional, yet nice to be around. You have excellent standards for how you communicate and collaborate.&nbsp;We’ll give you everything you need to do your absolute best, most creative and challenging work – with the least amount of frustration. Oh, and we never outsource development and we don’t work with arbitrary deadlines, because we believe both&nbsp;lead to bad solutions.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our main office is&nbsp;in Copenhagen&nbsp;and we work with flexible hours.&nbsp;Working&nbsp;remotely is an option if you’re in no more than 1&nbsp;hour from our main time zone (Central European Time).</div><div><br></div><div><span>We believe in fewer great people than many average and invest in people who are self-driven.

Here is some of what you can expect working here:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>. Developers are organized into autonomous teams of 2-4 developers and have a lot of control over how they collaborate, communicate, and work in general.</li><br><li><strong>Agility</strong>. Teams practice scrum, work in sprints, calculate velocity, do code reviews and rely on Continuous Integration.</li><br><li><strong>Location Independence</strong>. Remote work is built into our company’s DNA. Half of our developers are remote!</li><br><li><strong>Craftsmanship</strong>. We have excellent engineers spanning all skill levels, and we are all committed to becoming better at our craft. We practice Lunch &amp; Learns,mentorship, and pair programming.</li><br><li><strong>Stewardship</strong>. We are big proponents of open source, use it a lot, and give back to the community wherever we can.</li><br></ul><br><p>Our 17 year old codebase is constantly evolving to incorporate modern technologies. We started with Java, moved into JRuby on Rails leveraging the Java code with JRuby, and are now incorporating React where it makes sense. We use RSpec for testing Ruby and Java, and Jest for JavaScript.</p><br><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><br><p>We care about our people, and as such are strong believers in having fun at work, continuing education and work/life/family balance. We demonstrate that in the followings ways:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong><strong>Competitive Pay</strong>. We hire excellent people and reward them accordingly.</strong></li><br><li><strong>One Paid Conference</strong> per year (including hotel and airfare).</li><br><li><strong>DashCon.</strong> An internal yearly conference showcasing our engineering culture.</li><br><li><strong>10% time per week</strong> to invest in open source or self-education.</li><br><li><strong>Work from anywhere</strong> in any timezone.</li><br><li><strong>Great benefits</strong>.

Our unique company philosophy fosters innovation, excellence and collaboration. Employees are encouraged to take risks and work on projects and products that the market has never seen before.</p><br><p><br>We value personality and fit as much as we value the engineering ability and technical expertise. We want to keep our work environment positive, helpful and collaborative. &nbsp;We are looking for pragmatists, and people who can empathize with users and team members.<br><br>You must demonstrate strong skills in either Rails, Java, or React. While we don’t expect you to know all of the above, you should at least be very proficient at one or more of these.

For subscription companies, this is a HUGE problem. Left untreated, it can cause more than 50% of a company's churn. Left poorly-treated, customers face poor billing experiences, and companies lose good customers to bad process.</div><div><br></div><div>We currently integrate with companies who use Stripe, and Stripe Subscriptions. You're going to help us expand to integrate with every payment system in the world. And not only that, you're going to make it easy, and fast, for those customers to start printing money with Churn Buster.</div><div><br></div><div>Building on a fully-rearchitected platform, integrations are easy, despite the fact that you'll often be integrating with legacy technology.

Working for a small company, you know how important growth is, and you work to identify 80% solutions to close loops, and move on to the next challenging problem to solve.</div><div><br></div><div>You've worked heavily with APIs and Webhooks in the past. You understand idempotency, error handling, race conditions, and you've witnessed first-hand what can go wrong when careful planning doesn't go into system architecture.</div><div><br></div><div>You write unit tests with RSpec, and request specs too. But you don't overcomplicate the codebase in the name of faster tests.</div><div><br></div><div>You love writing documentation so that customers, teammates, and future-you don't have to use those darn brains to figure-out already solved problems.</div><div><br></div><div>And you're not afraid to hop on the phone with leads/customers to help ensure they're integration/experience is going smoothly.</div><div><br></div><div><b>We're at our best when we're solving hard problems for customers, and you take pride in being a part of that.</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>--</b></div><div><b>Your responsibilities at Churn Buster:</b></div><ul><li>Add new payment processor integrations</li><li>Improve existing integrations</li><li>Simplify/speed up onboarding for all integrations</li><li>Work with our customers' engineering teams when they need help</li><li>Write documentation regularly for recurring confusion points</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Requirements/Experience:</b></div><ul><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Sidekiq/Background workers</li><li>OOP/POROs</li><li>APIs</li><li>Webhooks</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Heroku/Review Apps</li><li>Git</li><li>RSpec</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Bonus Points:</b></div><ul><li>Payment-related APIs: Stripe, Braintree, etc</li><li>Sinatra</li><li>SQL (knowing when to not use ActiveRecord)</li><li>Component based Rails applications/Wisper</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>About the Job:</b></div><ul><li>Full-Time</li><li>100% Remote (US Pacific Time preferred, California even better - time zone is important since we'll be pairing frequently)</li><li>Unlimited Vacation</li></ul>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Email <a href='mailto:matt@churnbuster.io' rel='nofollow'>matt@churnbuster.io</a> and share why you think you're the perfect fit for the next chapter at Churn Buster.
