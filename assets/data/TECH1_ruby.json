Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of our Rails and API team that is responsible for building and maintaining our API that drives our mobile applications, as well as working to help us expand our rapidly growing web-app.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned Rubyist and have a solid knowledge of Rails</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Postgres, Heroku, modern JS and CSS frameworks.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and sick leave.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a Ruby gem, or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Remote working                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible hours                            </div>                            <div>                                 Large amounts of autonomy                            </div>                            <div>                                 Great pay, insurance, benfits                            </div>                    ",

Our unique company philosophy fosters innovation, excellence and collaboration. Employees are encouraged to take risks and work on projects and products that the market has never seen before.</p><p><br>We value personality and fit as much as we value the engineering ability and technical expertise. We want to keep our work environment positive, helpful and collaborative. &nbsp;We are looking for pragmatists, and people who can empathize with users and team members.<br><br>You must demonstrate strong skills in either Rails, Java, or React. While we don’t expect you to know all of the above, you should at least be very proficient at one or more of these. Almost all of our engineers are full-stack, so you must be willing to branch out and master different levels of the technology stack. You will be expected to code with Rails, Java and React. <br><br>A minimum of 2 years of professional development experience is required. &nbsp;You should demonstrate the ability to understand and develop requirements, and produce elegant, extensible object-oriented code (you will be tested on this).<br><br>You should also be familiar with various automated testing principles and techniques.

So we’re building a universal and social event solution to help event makers create the biggest impact. Without fuss or big budgets. Why?

We love creative thinkers and selfstarters,&nbsp;who&nbsp;never wait to be told what to do.</span></div><div><br></div><div>We believe in a&nbsp;flat bottom-up organization of work where culture trumps policy. We have little-to-no ‘middle layer’, as our&nbsp;team work semi-autonomously and leadership is semi-internalized.&nbsp;We’re 100 % product-driven, operating with a zero bug policy and exceptional product design; how things look, how they work and how they’re built.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Like us you’re ambitious and professional, yet nice to be around. You have excellent standards for how you communicate and collaborate.&nbsp;We’ll give you everything you need to do your absolute best, most creative and challenging work – with the least amount of frustration. Oh, and we never outsource development and we don’t work with arbitrary deadlines, because we believe both&nbsp;lead to bad solutions.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our main office is&nbsp;in Copenhagen&nbsp;and we work with flexible hours.&nbsp;Working&nbsp;remotely is an option if you’re in no more than 1&nbsp;hour from our main time zone (Central European Time).</div><div><br></div><div><span>We believe in fewer great people than many average and invest in people who are self-driven.

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Anywhere)</strong> </p><p><strong></strong><strong>Who are we?</strong></p><p>BuySellAds operates the largest self-serve advertising marketplace on the web. We’re an adtech company empowering publishers and advertisers to connect more efficiently.</p><p>Don’t let the “adtech” part scare you away: our mission is to help publishers better monetize their sites so they can spend their time focusing on what they care about (their content!) rather than selling ads. We leverage tech to help broker these sales, and attempt to distance ourselves from the shady world of advertising that existed before.</p><p>StackOverflow, CodingHorror.com, NPR, and The Atlantic are just some of the sites who we’re able to help make more money - connecting them with advertisers like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Braintree, and Atlassian who are all able to expand their reach through us.</p><p>We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 30 some-odd people spread out across 30+ cities in 5 countries (please note that right now we are requiring a large overlap with Eastern Time, however). We use PHP, Go, Rails, and React, but seek to hire developers who are language agnostic and are more interested in shipping quality code than bikeshedding it.</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p><p>We’re looking for developers at any level (junior, intermediate, senior) to help us build out our platform. Regardless of level, everyone on our dev team makes meaningful contributions that positively impact our team and our customers every day - you will likely ship code on your very first day at BSA.</p><p>Ideally, we’re looking for someone who is:</p><ul><li>Comfortable across the full stack of the development cycle: frontend, backend, database stuff, as well as following through with testing and shipping.</li><li>A self-starter: remote teams carry lots of autonomy. There’s no micromanaging here.</li><li>A great communicator: we’re big on teaching, learning, debating, and explaining, and these things require clear, deliberate communication.</li><li>Wary of bullet lists with more than 3 items in job postings: we aren’t heavily process-oriented or believe in tons of structure, and if your eyes have glazed over while reading this list, you might just fit right in.</li></ul><p>You’re likely more awesome than you think, so please apply even if you only check a few of these boxes.</p><p><strong>Interested?</strong></p><p>Woohoo! To apply, send us a blurb about who you are and what you’re into to devjob_q4_2017@buysellads.com. If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on what you like to build, things you’ve built in the past that you’re proud of, and what you’d like to be building now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</p><p>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straight-forward: we do an initial meet-and-greet phone screen, a live pair-coding session over Slack (our primary mode of communication), and a take-home coding test. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess. (For reference, in our last hiring round in the summer we responded to 100% of direct applicants and the average response time to an applicant was under 24 hours. The average time from initial contact to us extending an offer was 11 days.)</p><p>And if we are the right fit for each other? Awesome! Come build a platform to help fix advertising with us.</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> 100% remote team, high-impact role on a strong engineering team</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>",

We’re looking for a talented full-stack developer to join us on our journey, helping new parents escape loneliness on the days spent as sole carer for a young child.<br /><br />We’re building a diverse, talented and highly motivated team of people who are excited about building a next-generation company. We are a startup that fully embraces both the benefits and challenges of remote, flexible working and is passionate about promoting gender equality and parenting rights for dads.<br /><br />*About us*<br /><br />60% of mums go a whole day without adult interaction and a staggering 90% of new mums admit to feeling lonely. Yet there is a plethora of baby and toddler friendly activities on their doorstep waiting to be discovered. Singing, comedy, dancing - did you know there’s even a bring-your-baby coding class? Happity helps parents to find and book these activities. Fast.<br /><br />We have raised angel investment and the backing of Ignite Accelerator. Our beta site launched in a pocket of South East London and has rapidly grown to over 5,000 monthly users. We are now taking it to the next stage. We believe in building companies on trust, not fear, which means our team works from home in the hours they choose.

We fully expect our product development team to be at the core of our business and we will work with you to build out an exceptional technical team over time.<br /><br />We are looking for an experienced developer to help us build a cutting-edge platform managing real-time bookings and social sharing features.

Here is some of what you can expect working here:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>. Developers are organized into autonomous teams of 2-4 developers and have a lot of control over how they collaborate, communicate, and work in general.</li><br><li><strong>Agility</strong>. Teams practice scrum, work in sprints, calculate velocity, do code reviews and rely on Continuous Integration.</li><br><li><strong>Location Independence</strong>. Remote work is built into our company’s DNA. Half of our developers are remote!</li><br><li><strong>Craftsmanship</strong>. We have excellent engineers spanning all skill levels, and we are all committed to becoming better at our craft. We practice Lunch &amp; Learns,mentorship, and pair programming.</li><br><li><strong>Stewardship</strong>. We are big proponents of open source, use it a lot, and give back to the community wherever we can.</li><br></ul><br><p>Our 17 year old codebase is constantly evolving to incorporate modern technologies. We started with Java, moved into JRuby on Rails leveraging the Java code with JRuby, and are now incorporating React where it makes sense. We use RSpec for testing Ruby and Java, and Jest for JavaScript.</p><br><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><br><p>We care about our people, and as such are strong believers in having fun at work, continuing education and work/life/family balance. We demonstrate that in the followings ways:</p><br><ul><br><li><strong><strong>Competitive Pay</strong>. We hire excellent people and reward them accordingly.</strong></li><br><li><strong>One Paid Conference</strong> per year (including hotel and airfare).</li><br><li><strong>DashCon.</strong> An internal yearly conference showcasing our engineering culture.</li><br><li><strong>10% time per week</strong> to invest in open source or self-education.</li><br><li><strong>Work from anywhere</strong> in any timezone.</li><br><li><strong>Great benefits</strong>.

RealPage continues reinventing and evolving to meet the needs of the customers we serve through technology and vision. You can feel it in the work we do and the clients that benefit. Our unique company philosophy fosters innovation, excellence and collaboration. Employees are encouraged to take risks and work on projects and products that the market has never seen before.</p><br><p><br>We value personality and fit as much as we value the engineering ability and technical expertise. We want to keep our work environment positive, helpful and collaborative. &nbsp;We are looking for pragmatists, and people who can empathize with users and team members.<br><br>You must demonstrate strong skills in either Rails, Java, or React. While we don’t expect you to know all of the above, you should at least be very proficient at one or more of these. Almost all of our engineers are full-stack, so you must be willing to branch out and master different levels of the technology stack. You will be expected to code with Rails, Java and React. <br><br>A minimum of 2 years of professional development experience is required. &nbsp;You should demonstrate the ability to understand and develop requirements, and produce elegant, extensible object-oriented code (you will be tested on this).<br><br>You should also be familiar with various automated testing principles and techniques.

In addition to working with a great team and shipping a great leading SaaS product, one day every two weeks you'll invest in yourself. You can use that time to learn about new technologies, contribute to open source, or create side projects that help the company. The position is local Seattle, but will consider remote in Portland or Vancouver.</p></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",

We aim to provide satisfying challenges and a positive working environment because we want happy, productive employees who will be with us for many years.</p><p>We are willing to have you join us as a contractor or an employee depending on your availability and preference. Compensation is negotiable and based on your experience and skillset. If you're a headhunter or an agency, please propose specific candidates along with the associated costs.

We’ll invite you to join a dedicated Slack channel where we can reach each other and talk about the test.<br><br>If the test is successful, we’ll schedule a next meeting with other members of the company that you’ll be working with, directly or indirectly.<br><br>After this third interview, you’ll meet with the management team to discuss salary and other compensations.</li></ul></span></td><td></td><td></td><td><a rel='nofollow'><div></div></a></td>",
