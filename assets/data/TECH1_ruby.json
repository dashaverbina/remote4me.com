We are a small team of remote developers in India working along with the product team in NY. Dev team - 4. Overall company size - 12.</p><p>What: We’ve developed a web-based app designed to interest students and make them more successful at reading. It provides teachers with detailed analytics to drive learning intervention. We're now working on scaling the product and providing advanced features to aid student learning and empower teachers with more tools to help them see how to guide their students.</p><p>Why: We don’t do it just because it’s interesting (though it is). We do it because we’re obsessed with solving one of the most catastrophic, under-acknowledged problems in the US and the world: year after year, students graduate high school without being able to read at the level that is required for success in college and in life.</p><p>Where: New York, Bangalore &amp; other Indian cities.</p><p>Apply to us through AngelList:<a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-en...</a><a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engin...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, I'm now moving to Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.</p><p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.</p><p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity?Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case?If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.</p><p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).</p><p><i>Experience</i>: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.</p><p><i>Location</i>: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours. We are a registered employer in South Africa and Singapore, so it would be hassle-free if you're based in those countries. If not, and if you've never done remote work for a foreign company before, please be sure to find out how to legally do this iin your particular country (it may involve registering as self-employed, for example).</p><p>Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put &quot;Hacker News&quot; somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Think of the Union platform as a way for folks running programs like 500 Startups (they run on Union) or startup challenges at organizations like Comcast or the DoD (they also run on Union) to organize themselves, between calendaring, discussion management, learning tools, and event management.</p><p><i></i>Our stack and processes:<i></i> Union is Rails, React, Redis, Postgres, Elasticsearch. We run on AWS, and our operations are powered by Ansible. We use scrum because it provides just enough process to make us productive, but we try to avoid some of the major pitfalls by letting our whole team chime in on the process. We do continuous integration and delivery.</p><p><i></i>Our team:<i></i> We are a small, lean team and you would play a big part on how we work. We have some very experienced folks on the team but our minds aren’t set in stone. Help us define how to make you work at your best. Our organization is diverse, and we’re at about a 50/50 split between men and women org-wide.</p><p><i></i>Remote friendly:<i></i> We have parts of our org in DC, Portugal and Dubai. We’re open to people from anywhere but would love not to stretch our timezone span too much. But obviously we’ll make an exception for the right candidate(s).</p><p><i></i>Have questions?<i></i> Feel free to ask here, or just email me!</p><p>Send me an email.

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.</p><p>We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.</p><p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]</p><p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.</p><p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.</p><p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].</p><p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href='https://www.noredink.com/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/jobs</a></p><p>[1] <a href='https://www.noredink.com/about/team' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/about/team</a></p><p>[2] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/</a></p><p>[3] <a href='https://github.com/NoRedInk/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/NoRedInk/</a></p><p>[4] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan</a></p><p>[5] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...</a></p><p>[6] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 2 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.</p><p>We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.</p><p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]</p><p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.</p><p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.</p><p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].</p><p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href='https://www.noredink.com/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/jobs</a></p><p>[1] <a href='https://www.noredink.com/about/team' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/about/team</a></p><p>[2] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/</a></p><p>[3] <a href='https://github.com/NoRedInk/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/NoRedInk/</a></p><p>[4] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan</a></p><p>[5] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...</a></p><p>[6] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",
