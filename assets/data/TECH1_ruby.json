We are a small team of remote developers in India working along with the product team in NY. Dev team - 4. Overall company size - 12.</p><p>What: We’ve developed a web-based app designed to interest students and make them more successful at reading. It provides teachers with detailed analytics to drive learning intervention. We're now working on scaling the product and providing advanced features to aid student learning and empower teachers with more tools to help them see how to guide their students.</p><p>Why: We don’t do it just because it’s interesting (though it is). We do it because we’re obsessed with solving one of the most catastrophic, under-acknowledged problems in the US and the world: year after year, students graduate high school without being able to read at the level that is required for success in college and in life.</p><p>Where: New York, Bangalore &amp; other Indian cities.</p><p>Apply to us through AngelList:<a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-en...</a><a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engin...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

    "content": "<div>                  <span>SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE<p>The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, I'm now moving to Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.</p><p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses.</p><p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity?Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case?If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.</p><p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).</p><p><i>Experience</i>: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.</p><p><i>Location</i>: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK, unless you keep unusual working hours. We are a registered employer in South Africa and Singapore, so it would be hassle-free if you're based in those countries. If not, and if you've never done remote work for a foreign company before, please be sure to find out how to legally do this iin your particular country (it may involve registering as self-employed, for example).</p><p>Please mail careers@simplepay.co.za and put &quot;Hacker News&quot; somewhere in the subject. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Think of the Union platform as a way for folks running programs like 500 Startups (they run on Union) or startup challenges at organizations like Comcast or the DoD (they also run on Union) to organize themselves, between calendaring, discussion management, learning tools, and event management.</p><p><i></i>Our stack and processes:<i></i> Union is Rails, React, Redis, Postgres, Elasticsearch. We run on AWS, and our operations are powered by Ansible. We use scrum because it provides just enough process to make us productive, but we try to avoid some of the major pitfalls by letting our whole team chime in on the process. We do continuous integration and delivery.</p><p><i></i>Our team:<i></i> We are a small, lean team and you would play a big part on how we work. We have some very experienced folks on the team but our minds aren’t set in stone. Help us define how to make you work at your best. Our organization is diverse, and we’re at about a 50/50 split between men and women org-wide.</p><p><i></i>Remote friendly:<i></i> We have parts of our org in DC, Portugal and Dubai. We’re open to people from anywhere but would love not to stretch our timezone span too much.

You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog!

We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.</p><p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].</p><p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href='https://www.noredink.com/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/jobs</a></p><p>[1] <a href='https://www.noredink.com/about/team' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/about/team</a></p><p>[2] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/</a></p><p>[3] <a href='https://github.com/NoRedInk/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/NoRedInk/</a></p><p>[4] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan</a></p><p>[5] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...</a></p><p>[6] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

To apply, send us a blurb about who you are and what you’re into through Authentic Jobs. If you’re stuck on where to start, just focus on what you like to build, things you’ve built in the past that you’re proud of, and what you’d like to be building now. (You can attach a resume too, but we’re more interested in seeing what excites you rather than a bullet list of your previous jobs.)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straightforward: we do an initial meet-and-greet phone screen, a live pair-coding session over Slack (our primary mode of communication), and a short take-home coding test. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>And if we are the right fit?

    "content": "<h2>              Ruby on Rails Engineer<small> @ SurveyMonkey</small>          </h2><dl>          <dt></dt>          <dd><p></p></dd>          <dt></dt>          <dd><p>2018-03-07 21:06</p></dd>          <dt><span>Description</span></dt>          <dd><h5>About SurveyMonkey</h5><p>Founded in 1999, SurveyMonkey is the world’s leading platform for turning people’s voices and opinions into actionable data — People Powered Data. Whether it’s with customers, employees, or a target market, SurveyMonkey helps curious individuals and companies — including 99% of the Fortune 500 — have conversations at scale with the people who matter most. It’s People Powered Data that allows them to understand not only “what” is happening, but “why.” SurveyMonkey’s 700+ employees throughout North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are dedicated to powering the curious.</p><h5>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</h5><p>SurveyMonkey’s platform is used for a myriad of purposes across a broad spectrum of industries. That leaves ample opportunity to build targeted products that solve a specific problem. That’s where our team comes in. We’re responsible for building standalone solutions that address the needs of businesses.</p><p>So far, we’ve built three:</p><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement</li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Publish 3rd-party verified customer proof </li></ul><p>We operate each product as a small startup within the larger SurveyMonkey organization. This affords us flexibility to quickly try new ideas, but with the resources of larger company. Our goal is to build high growth, profitable businesses that leverage the enormous user base of SurveyMonkey.</p><h5>The Team</h5><p>Our small team is responsible for building products from soup to nuts. We wear many hats and span both the technical stack and departments. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside colleagues who have successfully launched and sold numerous products.</p><p>Most of us choose to focus on one solution at a time. We feel this allows us to fully embrace and understand our customer needs and develop a deep technical understanding of the problem domain. However, we are also committed to sharing our work - not just with each other, but via open source contributions.</p><h5>Who We’re Looking For</h5><p>We’re looking for a mid-level or senior developer with a deep understanding of all aspects of the web application stack. You should care about the quality of your code, user experience, and how your choices impact the business as a whole. You need to be able to evaluate tradeoffs and make decisions.</p><p>Our team has been building Rails applications for over ten years. That experience has solidified our belief that the default Rails stack is the single best way to build web applications.  While we shy away from complexity (like front end frameworks), we are quick to embrace tools that give us leverage (ActionCable, Turbolinks) or improve developer happiness (ES6, Webpacker).</p><p>If this mindset speaks to you, please include a cover letter along with your resume to introduce yourself. Our team puts a lot of stock in written communication. Plus, we’d appreciate a sense of your personality.</p><h5>Why Work Here?</h5><p>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific time zone by at least four hours, where you live and work is up to you. You will be asked to travel a few times a year for a full team meeting. We use this time not only for larger planning discussions, but also for a little social interaction. In the past year, we’ve gone bowling in Phoenix and made sushi in San Francisco.</p><p>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. If you consider yourself to be a manager of one, this role is a great fit.</p><p>We offer competitive salaries, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and equity compensation.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",
