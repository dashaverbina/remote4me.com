You’ve sold projects in the $100k – $1 million+ range, and are looking to go bigger.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all else, your daily attitude + output embody Modern Tribe’s company ethos of “live well and do good work”: you thrive on keeping the team happy and healthy. Matchmaking — not hitting sales numbers — is your jam. You hustle hard, enjoy the game and relish a genuine success. We pride ourselves on solving real problems for people rather than clutter the interwebs with more shit. If you jive with the mission of setting your team up for success, giving them the right flow and the right kind of projects, even if it means rejecting a potentially-lucrative gig…we’d love to hear from you.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Modern Tribe is not interested non-technical sales candidates at this time.</span></div><div><h3>Responsibilities</h3></div><div><span></span></div><div>Each of Modern Tribe’s team members closes upwards of $1 million in new project work each year.
