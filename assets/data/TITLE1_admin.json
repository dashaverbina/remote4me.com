One in five fruits and vegetables grown in America never make it off the farm due to tiny cosmetic defects that do not affect quality, often causing them to go to waste. Imperfect is on a mission to find a home for these fruits and veggies by selling them for a 30-50% discount with a lovable, hip brand. We offer the most affordable and environmentally-responsible produce option, starting with our weekly produce delivery service across the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Chicago. In addition to building a scalable solution to fight food waste, our business model also generates extra revenue to farmers. Imperfect has raised significant investment and has been featured in major publications including the New York Times, PBS NewsHour, NPR, Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, and the front page of National Geographic. We have put together a team of the leading food waste entrepreneurs in the country and are working with a team of world-class advisors, including Doug Rauch, former President of Trader Joe’s.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Free produce, Bevi, and kombucha!                            </div>                            <div>                                 MacBook Air Laptops                            </div>                            <div>                                 Health Care (Kaiser or Blue Shield)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Vacation Days                            </div>                            <div>                                 Ping Pong and Foosball tables                            </div>                            <div>                                 Equal Opportunity Employer                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commuter Benefits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Sit/Stand Desks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Stock Options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Bonus                            </div>                    ",

    "content": "<h2>              Senior Infrastructure Engineer<small> @ Ghost</small>          </h2><dl>          <dt></dt>          <dd><p></p></dd>          <dt></dt>          <dd><p>2018-03-20 13:32</p></dd>          <dt><span>Description</span></dt>          <dd><h5>We're looking for a new member of the Ghost team, maybe it's you?</h5><p>We're a non-profit organisation on a mission to create modern, independent publishing technology to power the future of online journalism.</p><p>This is not a rocket-ship. You won't find any unicorn glitter or exponential curves around here, just a real company with a sustainable business which has been profitable from year 1 and has been growing healthily ever since. Currently our Annual Recurring Revenue is just over <strong>$930,000</strong> - and annual net revenue is over <strong>$1.1million</strong>. We're very transparent about our mission and our metrics, you can <a href='https://ghost.org/about/' rel='nofollow'>read all about us</a>.</p><p>Ghost is a full stack web application for running independent publications. It’s one of the most popular modern open source projects in the world, and is used in production by tens of thousands of websites and companies.</p><p>Chances are you've already visited and read sites which run on Ghost. Our users range from hugely popular bloggers like <strong>Jeff Atwood, Troy Hunt</strong> and <strong>Joel Gascoigne</strong> - all the way through to some of the world's largest organisations like <strong>Square, DuckDuckGo, Open AI, CloudFlare, Digital Ocean, Mozilla, Napster, Tinder, OkCupid</strong> and <a href='https://ghost.org/customers' rel='nofollow'>many, many more</a>.</p><p>Ghost as a business is made up of two primary products:</p><ul><li><a href='https://github.com/tryghost/ghost' rel='nofollow'>Ghost</a> - An open source CMS/app which can be used for free by anyone</li><li><a href='https://ghost.org/pricing/' rel='nofollow'>Ghost(Pro)</a> - A fully managed hosting platform with powerful automation</li></ul><p>The hosting platform is targeted at professional/business users, which in turn funds the entire company to build free, open source software for everyone.</p><p>As the company grows, we’re looking for an experienced infrastructure engineer to join the team and lead the development of our <strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong> platform and services. This is a senior role reporting directly to Ghost’s CTO, <a href='https://github.com/erisds' rel='nofollow'>Hannah</a>, with plenty of freedom and control to architect a real production system which is already serving over 100million requests a month - with a ton of room for improvement.</p><h5>What we're looking for</h5><p>All of our infrastructure and systems have gone through several iterations, but have ultimately been built by a small/scrappy team of passionate developers without significant prior sysadmin experience. Our platform these days is pretty solid, but it took us a long time and a lot of trial and error to get here. What we’re looking for now is someone who is comfortable and confident in leading our architecture and taking it to the next level.</p><p>For this position, we're explicitly looking for someone experienced (5+ years sysadmin experience, minimum) and confident in taking on a broad set of responsibilities managing, deploying and maintaining complex projects across several different environments.</p><p>Extensive experience in systems management and automation is a must. <strong>Experience specifically relating to web hosting at scale, continuous integration, monitoring and performance management is a huge advantage.</strong> Previous remote work and startup experience is also very valuable.</p><p>Our infrastructure is comprised of about 100 servers across two DigitalOcean datacenters, running Ubuntu and managed with Saltstack, sitting behind a fairly deep Cloudflare CDN integration. Most common tech across our instances includes MariaDB, Nginx and Phusion Passenger, LXC, Gluster and a whole lot of JavaScript.</p><p>This role requires someone who is exceptional at clear, frequent communication - in particular around quickly identifying and responding to infrastructure failures, as well as…</p><ul><li>Analysing infrastructure requirements and optimisations based on app performance and user load scenarios.</li><li>Database clustering and replication management.</li><li>Monitoring and alert management.</li><li>Common security issues and mitigation strategies.</li></ul><p>Leading our infrastructure is the base which the rest of the team builds on top of, so it is easily one of the most significant and important roles in the entire company.</p><p>People who are great at written communication and highly self-motivated tend to do best at Ghost. The majority of the team is made up of former founders, freelancers and self-starters who are confident and comfortable working independently and getting things done.</p><p>This role would be well suited to someone in an existing ops team at a fast-paced technology company looking for a more senior position where they’re able to have more control and leadership of systems architecture across an entire organisation. There are a lot of opportunities for growth here as the team expands.</p><p>We don't mind where you're based or what hours you work, but this role does require reasonable working-hours overlap with the rest of our internal/ops engineering team in Europe, as well as availability to be on-call on a rotating schedule in the event of downtime.</p><p>We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We have as many people who speak German as we do English and our engineering team contains as many women as it does men. Some of us are single, others are married, while others are parents. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.</p><h5>What it's like to work here</h5><p>The vast majority of our work gets done on Github, with Slack as the main channel for communication. We do a weekly meetings via Zoom which are used to discuss progress and plan what's coming next.</p><p>The biggest perk of working at Ghost is that we have a small, talented team with a very large audience. This means you have the ability to have a huge impact on the product and the company, whilst also having really interesting and challenging problems to work on. We believe deeply in what we do, and we're all in this to build something lasting, sustainable and positive.</p><p>On top of all that, we try to treat people pretty well. All roles at Ghost come with:</p><ul><li><strong>Competitive salary</strong><ul><li>We pay very well at market rates reflecting both location and experience.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fully remote work</strong><ul><li>Work from anywhere in the world, or travel continuously if that's your thing. Everything we do is online. As long as you have wifi, you're all set.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All the tech you need</strong><ul><li>We'll pay for whatever hardware and software you need to work and make sure you're regularly upgraded to the latest versions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Office costs covered</strong><ul><li>Whether you prefer a home office or a co-working space, we'll help pay for it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Personal development</strong><ul><li>An annual budget for books, courses, conferences and travel expenses.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Twice annual international team retreats</strong><ul><li>Every 6 months we get the whole crew together for a week away. The last few trips have taken us to Dubai, Thailand, Austria &amp; Egypt.</li></ul></li><li><strong>3 day weekends, all year long</strong><ul><li>We close the office on the last Friday of every single month. Enjoy!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Unlimited paid vacation</strong><ul><li>Minimum 2 weeks per year, if you don't take it yourself, we kick you out of the office in December until the new year rolls around.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Paid parental leave</strong><ul><li>When the time comes to welcome a new member of the family, we offer 3 months fully paid parental leave.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Guaranteed pay-rises</strong><ul><li>Everyone at Ghost receives a minimum 5% pay increase each year to reward loyalty and offset the cost of inflation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Dog friendly office</strong><ul><li>Just kidding we literally don't have an office - but apparently tech companies think is an important detail to put on job descriptions and we didn't want to feel left out. So, um. Feel free to work with your dog.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>How to apply</h5><p>We don't hire people often, and positions rarely open up. We're pretty proud that in the 5 years since Ghost started nobody has ever quit. So when we do add a member to the team, we're pretty diligent about it. This is a very different attitude to most companies.</p><p>We’re profitable, we have unlimited runway, and extremely healthy revenue growth. There is no investor pressure or time limit or need to hire as many people as fast as possible to fill a fancy office. We want to keep the team as small as we can, automate as much as possible with robots, build great software, and enjoy our work as much as possible. Those are the things we optimise for. If that sounds like a good fit for you, then we’d encourage you to get in touch.</p><p>All jobs at Ghost start with an application form, progressing to 1-2 short phone interviews, and finally a paid trial project.</p><p>Rather than trying to guess if we'll work well together based on lengthy arbitrary interview questions or &quot;code challenges&quot; - instead we invite promising candidates to work on a real life trial project with us and pay them for their time. Trial projects are typically 20-30 hours of work, and give us an opportunity to get to know each other prior to pursuing a full time offer. It’s also a chance for candidates to get to know the Ghost team and make sure that it’s a good fit for them.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

Distributed systems engineer Node.js & Go (remote)<br />h3(=alted). <br />Job description<br /><br /><br />*What makes Ably special?*<br /><br />Ably helps power next generation digital experiences. Ones which are live rather than static, where data is in motion rather than at rest. <br />Things like live chat, realtime location tracking, live document collaboration, gaming and elearning. Customers include Tennis Australia, OfferUp, Yahoo, and even an air traffic control system for drones.<br />Working at Ably means you are working on a cutting-edge truly distributed product that is helping build the future.<br /> <br />*What we can offer you - in brief*<br /><br />You will learn with the best. You will have autonomy and freedom to experiment and improve. You will be part of a dynamic team and a business that is taking off.  We have just &quot;completed a $1m financing round to fuel our growth&quot;:http://www.eu-startups.com/2017/07/london-based-ably-raises-1-million-to-deliver-next-generation-realtime-digital-experiences/. We have the best technology, and the &quot;best people&quot;:https://www.ably.io/about/team in the industry.  <br />Join us now and you'll be early in at a business going places, you'll learn a lot, you'll work with the founding team, and you'll have fun.<br /><br />*What we want in return  -  in brief*<br />We want someone smart, ambitious, curious and motivated. Someone is prepared to do their best and work their arse off to do great work and become outstanding at what they do.<br /> <br />*Job description*<br />You'll be working with a deeply technical engineering team who collectively bring a wealth of experience and broad technology skills. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites us each day and motivates us each.  If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably.  Our team is made up of a strong remote contingent, however our base is in London and growing. We are strong believers in face-to-face communication where possible. Whilst this is a remote working role, being able to practically travel to London occasionally is highly preferable and working on a similar time zone is a must.<br /> <br />*Day to day you can expect to be working on:*<br /><br />* The &quot;core&quot; realtime platform which is largely Node.js and Go. You will also be required to work on the various services and routing layers of the platform which are built in Go and Elixir (we would expect you to be comfortable in either Go or Elixir, both would be a big win). As an aside, we use Ruby for all infrastructure automation and orchestration and occasionally write lower-level native code where necessary (such as native modules for Node). We're always revisiting the technologies we use and are always open to using new technologies where suitable.<br />* Working within the realtime platform and solving distributed programming problems. &quot;Find out what it takes to be a distributed systems engineer&quot;:https://blog.ably.io/what-is-a-distributed-systems-engineer-f6c1d921acf8. <br />* Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.<br />* Diagnosing and fixing bugs in our platform using distributed tracing techniques.<br />* Adding suitable test coverage to new features as well as existing functionality, conducting load tests using our frameworks, and generally helping to address platform stability and regression prevention.<br />* Be responsible for the complete lifecycle of your features and code i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments with ownership of any issues that arise.  We are strong believers in all developers being involved in the system operations as well.<br />* Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products.  All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.<br />* Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.<br />* Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.<br />* Suggestions for new features or improvements to &quot;our protocol and API specifications&quot;:https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/.<br /><br /> <br />*Benefits*<br /><br />* Salary range: €40k to €85k. Depends entirely on skills and experience.<br />* Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays. Can be negotiated.<br />* Benefit from a truly flexible working environment in which remote working and managing your own working time is the norm.<br />* Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about. <br />* Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.<br />* Work with genuinely nice people who care.<br /><br />h3(=alted). <br />Requirements<br /><br /><br />* Experience: A minimum of a three years of professional experience in Node.js. Go and/or Elixir experience is very beneficial. You must have experience using both statically and dynamically typed languages, ideally in at least one other language. Any exposure to realtime and distributed systems is a real advantage. An understanding of Ruby is beneficial in regards to infrastructure automation and tooling, but not necessary.<br />* Pragmatic: A problem solver excited by the prospect of working autonomously solve problems and bring solutions to the team.<br />* Fast Learner: We're looking for software engineers who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies.  Our stack is diverse, and we expect it to continue to grow.<br />* Testing: Experience using testing frameworks and adoption of test driven development where applicable.<br />* Infrastructure: Experience with infrastructure and distributed systems is beneficial.<br />* Communication: We use tools such as Slack throughout the day to communicate, however we believe in voice conversations to discuss and solve problems. You must be proficient in spoken and written English, be eager to collaborate with the engineering team and constructively welcome code reviews.<br />* Customers: Comfortable talking to customers and assisting them with their technical issues and integration.<br />* Open source: We prefer developers who have contributed back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small. <br /><br /><br />h3.

Customers include Tennis Australia, OfferUp, Yahoo, and even an air traffic control system for drones.<br>Working at Ably means you are working on a cutting-edge truly distributed product that is helping build the future.</p><p><strong>What we can offer you – in brief</strong></p><p>You will learn with the best. You will have autonomy and freedom to experiment and improve. You will be part of a dynamic team and a business that is taking off. &nbsp;We have just&nbsp;<a href='http://www.eu-startups.com/2017/07/london-based-ably-raises-1-million-to-deliver-next-generation-realtime-digital-experiences/' rel='nofollow'>completed a $1m financing round to fuel our growth</a>.

Someone is prepared to do their best and work their arse off to do great work and become outstanding at what they do.</p><p><strong>Job description</strong></p><p>You'll be working with a deeply technical engineering team who collectively bring a wealth of experience and broad technology skills. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites us each day and motivates us each. &nbsp;If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably. &nbsp;Our team is made up of a strong remote contingent, however our base is in London and growing. We are strong believers in face-to-face communication where possible. Whilst this is a remote working role, being able to practically travel to London occasionally is highly preferable and working on a similar time zone is a must.</p><p>Day to day you can expect to be working on:</p><ul><li>  The &quot;core&quot; realtime platform which is largely Node.js and Go. You will also be required to work on the various services and routing layers of the platform which are built in Go and Elixir (we would expect you to be comfortable in either Go or Elixir, both would be a big win). As an aside, we use Ruby for all infrastructure automation and orchestration and occasionally write lower-level native code where necessary (such as native modules for Node). We're always revisiting the technologies we use and are always open to using new technologies where suitable.</li><li>  Working within the realtime platform and solving distributed programming problems.&nbsp;<a href='https://blog.ably.io/what-is-a-distributed-systems-engineer-f6c1d921acf8' rel='nofollow'>Find out what it takes to be a distributed systems engineer</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>  Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.</li><li>  Diagnosing and fixing bugs in our platform using distributed tracing techniques.</li><li>  Adding suitable test coverage to new features as well as existing functionality, conducting load tests using our frameworks, and generally helping to address platform stability and regression prevention.</li><li>  Be responsible for the complete lifecycle of your features and code i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments with ownership of any issues that arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are strong believers in all developers being involved in the system operations as well.</li><li>  Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products. &nbsp;All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.</li><li>  Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.</li><li>  Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.</li><li>  Suggestions for new features or improvements to <a href='https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/' rel='nofollow'>our protocol and API specifications</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>  Salary range:&nbsp;€40k to €85k. Depends entirely on skills and experience.</li><li>  Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays. Can be negotiated.</li><li>  Benefit from a truly flexible working environment in which remote working and managing your own working time is the norm.</li><li>  Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about.&nbsp;</li><li>  Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.</li><li>  Work with genuinely nice people who care.</li></ul><p><strong>**** NO AGENCIES PLEASE **</strong>**</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United Kingdom</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>Within Europe</p></dd>        </dl>",

I am now continuing to foster it. optile is firmly based on mutual respect, hiring smart people and getting out of their way (aka taking responsibility), honest feedback and transparency. Work here is challenging, but also fun and I personally focus on creating a team of happy humans who build great software. We pay competitive wages and have a good track record of providing incentives through equity for all employees. There are free soft drinks, beer, coffee and fruit.</p><p>We do have remote positions available in building payment method adapters, as the adapter team is the one that has most experience and the cultural tenets to work remotely, but the core team and the company is still local to Munich. One thing can lead to another, though.</p><p>That said, we are looking for:- Java developers of all kinds (junior, senior, you name it). The adapter developer position mentioned above needs more of a &quot;senior&quot; profile.- ReactJS/Redux/ReactNative developers (junior, senior, you name it)- Internal IT Administrator (preferably a generalist with an interest in everything and experience in structuring heterogeneous systems and herding cats)- Quality Assurance Lead (big focus on automation, but also taking a holistic view of the end-to-end product experience)</p><p>We are also looking for candidates in &quot;not typically HackerNews&quot; positions. We have openings for working students and in marketing and sales.</p><p>Experience with MongoDB, Spring, PostgreSQL, Lodash, D3.js, Vertx, perhaps a little bit of OSGi (yeah, we know, we're moving away from it), a good understanding of cryptography, previous payment experience, risk models and machine learning are all a plus.</p><p>If anything of the above sounds good to you, please click the above link and send us your CV :).<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

This role is responsible for Fastly’s overall hardware architecture vision, strategy, and roadmap. As Director of Hardware Systems Engineering you will be required to recruit, hire, and retain a top notch, globally distributed team of infrastructure architects and test/lab engineers. Expect that your team will be presented with unreleased hardware for testing, evaluation, and integration into our stack. Know in advance that there will be many unknowns, most often a lack of documentation and drivers, but that is OK because such situations excite you. In this role, you will be expected to latch onto complex problems and drive the team towards success.</p><p>Your team of architects are people who are comfortable laying out a datacenter, building up rack elevations, and know the three-phase power equation. They are comfortable picking the right Intel Scalable Xeon Processor to replace the current line of E5-2697v4s in use today. And they will ruthlessly reason about DIMM power density and heat output versus cooling fan velocity. They will aggressively complain about poor driver implementations and then make suggestions on how to improve them. They will debate the merits of using CDWM passive multiplexing systems for short haul 10GE extensions over the aggregation services into 100GE circuits because colored lasers are neat.</p><p>You are responsible for organizing cross functional hardware projects at Fastly because we all know high performing hardware needs deep software integration. You’ll integrate with leaders in our kernel, driver, and caching teams to help ensure efficient use of our hardware. As Director you will bring harmony to the chaos of the hardware supply chain. You’ll work to ensure seamless technical integrations with Fastly’s stack while ensuring upstream availability of goods from manufacturers. You should have a mind for the business details so that you know when you are paying too much for NAND.</p><p><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><ul><li>Recruits, retains, and manages globally distributed infrastructure architects and hardware systems engineers.</li><li>Develops and iterates on system hardware strategies to optimize for performance and cost.</li><li>Engages with key supply chain partners to understand roadmaps, future product release, and long term strategic benefits to Fastly.</li><li>Works with business functions (finance, legal, and compliance) to ensure objectives on budget, risk, and compliance are adhered to and met.</li></ul><p><strong>PRIOR EXPERIENCE</strong></p><ul><li>Prior leadership experience in engineering, systems, and/or IT.</li><li>5+ years of direct experience designing large server environments.</li></ul><p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>B.S. level credentials in Engineering and/or Computer Science.</li><li>Must be a capable leader with experience in running distributed teams.</li><li>Must be a strong communicator, verbally and in documentation.</li><li>Capable of designing metrics, iterating on measurement, and driving change.</li><li>Comfortable with Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, bonus for any of SQL, R, Python.</li></ul><p><em>Fastly provides equal employment opportunity without regard to an applicant’s race, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, genetic information, national origin, age, physical or mental disability, medical condition, religion, marital status or veteran status.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Applicants with disabilities may be entitled to reasonable accommodation under the terms of the Americans with Disabilities Act and certain state or local laws.

We&nbsp;work&nbsp;with customers across a number of sectors, including e-commerce, media, healthcare, and&nbsp;fintech. The infrastructures we manage support millions of pounds of transactions every month.</p><p>Working with other Scale Factory colleagues, you'll help to build and support customers' platforms, working with their engineers to put together a foundation of good DevOps practise, helping them move faster, maintain uptime, and keep their secrets safe and secure.</p><p>Most of our work centres around ReadyScale, our platform design for scalable cloud infrastructure. This is currently built mainly from Terraform, Puppet, AWS and Ruby.</p><p><strong>Teams</strong></p><p>Our <em>Platform Engineering</em> team works on ReadyScale, adding features, fixing bugs, and deploying it to our customers.</p><p>Our <em>Customer Engineering</em> team supports and maintains deployed ReadyScale platforms for our customers, rolling out security patches and deploying platform improvements as well as keeping on top of support queries.</p><p>We're hiring for both teams right now, and if you're not sure where you'd fit best, that's fine -&nbsp;we rotate people through the teams from time to time. Everyone takes part in the out-of-hours on call rota, even the directors!</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Attitude, flexibility, and the ability to learn new technologies quickly, are all more important than years of experience. However you'll need production experience with:</p><ul><li>AWS</li><li>Linux (either CentOS or Ubuntu)</li><li>Configuration management (preferably Puppet, but a CM mindset is more important than the specific tool)</li></ul><p>Experience with the following would also be beneficial, but not required: Jenkins, Terraform, Packer, ELK, Vagrant, Prometheus, Docker, Kubernetes. As dictated by client requirements, we work with a number of different language environments&nbsp;and application frameworks. We even have one customer still running COBOL.</p><p>Honestly, if you're not sure if you have the relevant experience for this job, get in touch anyway and we'll figure it out together.</p><p><strong>Other</strong></p><p>The salary range listed here is indicative - we'll make you an offer based on your location and experience.</p><p>We're not looking to work with&nbsp;recruiters&nbsp;to fill this role.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About The Scale Factory            </h2>            <div><p>The Scale Factory is a growing London-based consultancy. We design, build, operate, support and scale Linux infrastructure for clients of various sizes, across a number of business sectors.</p><p>We have an office near London Bridge, but we support remote working as long as you're within the UK; we encourage our team to make their own schedule with the hours that work best for them. That said, client visits (mostly London, but sometimes further afield) will occasionally be necessary, and some client engagements will influence the hours you'll need to be available - but most are pretty flexible around this too.</p><p>As well as monthly co-working days (one in London, one in Manchester), we bring the whole team together every couple of months for planning sessions, hack days, and socialising. We try to ensure that our social time is balanced and inclusive: we'll sometimes play board games in the office instead of just defaulting to&nbsp;a visit to the pub (though we do that from time to time too!)</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 25 days holiday per year                            </div>                            <div>                                 High spec Macbook or Thinkpad                            </div>                            <div>                                 Budget for conference attendance (incl. international travel)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Culture of inclusivity                            </div>                            <div>                                 Group life protection &amp; critical illness cover scheme                            </div>                            <div>                                 Mixture of on-site and remote work                            </div>                            <div>                                 Friendly colleagues, with a wealth of experience to share                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible working hours to suit you                            </div>                            <div>                                 Training and development opportunities                            </div>                    ",

If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us. </p><p>The role:</p><p>Are you looking for the next frontier and challenge where you can apply your expertise in penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, and threat modeling?  Smart contracts are programs on a blockchain: they never go down, cannot be changed, and run as programmed.  These smart contracts directly control money, so you can see that their security is critical.</p><p>ConsenSys is a development pioneer of the Ethereum ecosystem and many of our tools such as Truffle, INFURA, MetaMask, BlockApps, are among the most widely adopted globally.  With ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.</p><p>ConsenSys is expanding its efforts on smart contract security to meet the needs of enterprise clients as well as home-grown platforms ranging from prediction markets to decentralized crowdfunding, including uPort, Gnosis, Stabl, WeiFund, and Virtue Poker.  Our aim is to build the most technically-gifted and engineering-focused blockchain security team.</p><p>We are looking to hire someone with a passion for Solidity, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and security.  Candidates should relish in technical subtleties and minutiae, and have a passion for combining them with a flair for creativity and insight to hack smart contracts.</p><p>A significant part of the work can be done remotely wherever you are; little travel is anticipated (most of the technical team works remotely around the world). There's also opportunity to stay ahead of demand and lead and build out this team in case that's also of interest. This will be an engineering-first development organization, with the autonomy to manage itself in a manner conducive to software development excellence. It will be rigorous, demanding and not for everyone. We are looking for exceptionally intellectual, bright and technically driven individuals. We will be addressing challenges that have not been encountered before while borrowing from patterns in previous software architectures.</p><p>Qualifications</p><p>Minimum qualifications:</p><p>1 year demonstrated expertise with Solidity, the EVM, and blockchain</p><p>3 years of relevant work experience.</p><p>BS degree in a relevant field or equivalent practical experience.</p><p>Coding/scripting experience in one or more general purpose languages.</p><p>Preferred qualification:</p><p>Demonstrated expertise and contributions towards smart contract security, EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals), or research.</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience analyzing the security of systems (penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, etc.).</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience, including experience in responding to security problems in target-rich environments, looking at security alerts, front-line analysis and response.</p><p>Programming experience in Python, C/C++, Java, or Go.</p><p>Advanced degree (MS, PhD) in relevant field is a plus.</p><p>Who We are, some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:</p><p>The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.</p><p>A dynamic startup environment with runway. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization. At ConsenSys, the runway allows you to focus on what you do best without worrying about the runway.</p><p>Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new technologies, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</p><p>Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much work to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users. </p><p>ConsenSys was just named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators report.</p></div>",

Our team may be small, but NoRedInk is used by 1 in 3 school districts in the US, and students have answered over 2 billion questions on our platform.</p><p>We’re a group of friendly people who listen to and learn from each other. We discuss past mistakes openly so we can adapt our processes to the challenges that come with progress. Puns flow freely across our San Francisco office as well as on Slack, and we have remote engineers spanning six different time zones.</p><p>Our engineering team [1] prides itself on code quality and innovation. We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]</p><p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.</p><p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.</p><p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].</p><p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href='https://www.noredink.com/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/jobs</a></p><p>[1] <a href='https://www.noredink.com/about/team' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/about/team</a></p><p>[2] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/</a></p><p>[3] <a href='https://github.com/NoRedInk/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/NoRedInk/</a></p><p>[4] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan</a></p><p>[5] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...</a></p><p>[6] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",
