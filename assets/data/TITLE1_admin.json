We are looking for team members to help us develop world-class software products for the most exclusive organizations in the world. We have been at this since 2000, and continue to grow off our best asset, our people.</p><p>You are comfortable with security protocols and DevOps development. You have worked extensively with the Zed Attack Proxy Protocol and understand vulnerabilities and engage in proactive problem-solving.</p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>Clevertech looks for craftsmen developers who take ownership of their code. You can deliver quickly while being clever to avoid missteps. You have an effective positive attitude that shines as you show your care about client and colleague concerns. You are always learning and are a transparent communicator even when it is challenging. You thrive on challenging yourself daily and seek to surround yourself with like-minded individuals.</p><p>Technically, you have an excellent background with AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, logging, monitoring, and build tools.

You enjoy being on the bleeding edge of technology and are well versed in modern programming languages.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p><strong>Own Your Time</strong></p><p>We are a completely remote team. That means we have a large amount of trust and a lot of flexibility. World travellers, young parents, nature lovers, and commute avoiders love working here. We are a collective of like minded people in over ten countries, and our global perspective shapes our every move.</p><p><strong>Focused Work</strong></p><p>You will work together on a dedicated team with your eye on one finish line at a time. Our teams are nimble and agile, and cover the technical range you would expect in world class product delivery teams. And keep your eye on the mail - we send out swag everywhere in the world and there are celebratory pictures of Clevertech socks, hoodies, and mugs all over slack.</p><p><strong>Learn at your edges</strong></p><p>We believe in learning and provide unique programs that improve your tech skills, leadership skills and even challenge you in personal development. CleverFridays, guest speakers, mentorship opportunities and in-depth industry exposure are all on offer here.</p><p>And of course, if you speak at a tech conference, we cover all expenses.</p><p><strong>Recharge Time</strong></p><p>We insist that you take recharge time.

The web service is not part of our &quot;core product&quot; and thus has lower uptime requirements.</li></ul><p><br>See <strong><a href='https://goo.gl/cDUirr' rel='nofollow'>https://goo.gl/cDUirr</a></strong>&nbsp;and <strong><a href='https://goo.gl/XDpmBi' rel='nofollow'>https://goo.gl/XDpmBi</a></strong>&nbsp;for a taster on the lengths we go to at each layer in the stack to ensure 100% service uptime.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>Day to day you can expect to be working on:</strong></p><ul><li>Writing Ruby code for our infrastructure automation, orchestration, configuration and continuous integration testing of our infrastructure.</li><li>Writing Go code for our core routing, workers and infrastructure services.</li><li>Making extensive use of a wide range of AWS services. Whilst we primarily use AWS for our infrastructure, in time we expect that to change as we span other cloud services.</li><li>Managing and developing out our continuous integration services that test every aspect of the service, from infrastructure tools, to our health servers, routers, realtime services, protocol adaptors and client libraries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our CI environment is mature, yet we would like to continue to evolve our CI environments to help improve the robustness of the platform and reduce risk of regressions.</li><li>Being exposed to our other development environments such as Node.js and Elixir, both used extensively in our realtime services.</li><li>Working with the realtime engineering team to ensure our infrastructure supports the ever changing networking, security and processing requirements.</li><li>Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.</li><li>Diagnosing and fixing bugs in all areas of our platform. &nbsp;You will often be working at very low levels in the network stack to help diagnose difficult to identify distributed problems.</li><li>Work with the engineering team to enable them to take responsibility for the complete lifecycle of the features and code they deliver i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments. We are strong believers in all developers being responsible for deploying their own code.</li><li>Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products. &nbsp;All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.</li><li>Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.</li><li>Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.</li><li>Suggestions for new features or improvements to <strong><a href='https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/' rel='nofollow'>our protocol and API specifications</a></strong>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;<br><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Salary range: €40k to €85k.</li><li>Employee options: Yes, negotiable.</li><li>Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays.</li><li>This role can be remote or on-site in our London office. However, if you are working remotely, you will need to be in a European timezone so that we can communicate effectively during business hours, and you will need to be close enough to visit our office in London occasionally. &nbsp;Our preference is to have a team member near enough to commute to our London office when necessary. You will benefit from a flexible working environment in which working from home and managing your own working hours sensibly is the norm.&nbsp;</li><li>Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about.&nbsp;</li><li>Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.</li><li>Work with genuinely nice and smart people who care about code quality and enjoying their jobs.</li></ul><p><br><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience: A minimum of a three years of professional experience with Go as Go is used in all our routing and infrastructure services.&nbsp; Our infrastructure automation and orchestration layer requires you to be proficient in Ruby. You should have experience using both statically and dynamically typed languages. Experience with Node.js and Elixir/Erlang is beneficial. You must have solid experience managing infrastructure and CI environments, and any distributed or large scale infrastructure management is preferred. <strong><a href='https://blog.ably.io/what-is-a-distributed-systems-engineer-f6c1d921acf8' rel='nofollow'>Understanding of distributed systems</a></strong>&nbsp;is beneficial.</li><li>Pragmatic: A problem solver excited by the prospect of automating your job away and working autonomously to solve problems and bring solutions to the team.</li><li>Fast Learner: We’re looking for software engineers who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies. &nbsp;Our stack is diverse, and we expect it to continue to grow.</li><li>Testing: Experience using testing frameworks and adoption of test driven development where applicable.</li><li>Communication: We use tools such as Slack throughout the day to communicate, however we believe in voice conversations to discuss and solve problems. You must be proficient in spoken and written English, be eager to collaborate with the engineering team and constructively welcome code reviews.</li><li>Customers: Comfortable talking to customers and assisting them with their technical issues and integration.</li><li>Open source:&nbsp;We prefer developers who have contributed back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Are you up for the challenge?</strong><br>Apply now via the <strong><a href='https://ltpx.nl/DY67OuB' rel='nofollow'>application form</a></strong>.

Someone is prepared to do their best and work their arse off to do great work and become outstanding at what they do.</p><p><strong>Job description</strong></p><p>You'll be working with a deeply technical engineering team who collectively bring a wealth of experience and broad technology skills. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites us each day and motivates us each. &nbsp;If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably. &nbsp;Our team is made up of a strong remote contingent, however our base is in London and growing. We are strong believers in face-to-face communication where possible. Whilst this is a remote working role, being able to practically travel to London occasionally is highly preferable and working on a similar time zone is a must.</p><p>Day to day you can expect to be working on:</p><ul><li>  The &quot;core&quot; realtime platform which is largely Node.js and Go. You will also be required to work on the various services and routing layers of the platform which are built in Go and Elixir (we would expect you to be comfortable in either Go or Elixir, both would be a big win). As an aside, we use Ruby for all infrastructure automation and orchestration and occasionally write lower-level native code where necessary (such as native modules for Node). We're always revisiting the technologies we use and are always open to using new technologies where suitable.</li><li>  Working within the realtime platform and solving distributed programming problems.</li><li>  Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.</li><li>  Diagnosing and fixing bugs in our platform using distributed tracing techniques.</li><li>  Adding suitable test coverage to new features as well as existing functionality, conducting load tests using our frameworks, and generally helping to address platform stability and regression prevention.</li><li>  Be responsible for the complete lifecycle of your features and code i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments with ownership of any issues that arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are strong believers in all developers being involved in the system operations as well.</li><li>  Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products. &nbsp;All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.</li><li>  Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.</li><li>  Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.</li><li>  Suggestions for new features or improvements to&nbsp;<a href='https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/' rel='nofollow'>our protocol and API specifications</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>  Salary range:&nbsp;€40k to €85k. Depends entirely on skills and experience.</li><li>  Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays. Can be negotiated.</li><li>  Benefit from a truly flexible working environment in which remote working and managing your own working time is the norm.</li><li>  Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about.&nbsp;</li><li>  Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.</li><li>  Work with genuinely nice people who care.\\</li></ul><h4>Requirements</h4><ul><li>  Experience: A minimum of a three years of professional experience in Node.js. Go and/or Elixir experience is very beneficial. You must have experience using both statically and dynamically typed languages, ideally in at least one other language. Any exposure to realtime and distributed systems is a real advantage. An understanding of Ruby is beneficial in regards to infrastructure automation and tooling, but not necessary.</li><li>  Pragmatic: A problem solver excited by the prospect of working autonomously solve problems and bring solutions to the team.</li><li>  Fast Learner: We're looking for software engineers who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies. &nbsp;Our stack is diverse, and we expect it to continue to grow.</li><li>  Testing: Experience using testing frameworks and adoption of test driven development where applicable.</li><li>  Infrastructure: Experience with infrastructure and distributed systems is beneficial.</li><li>  Communication: We use tools such as Slack throughout the day to communicate, however we believe in voice conversations to discuss and solve problems. You must be proficient in spoken and written English, be eager to collaborate with the engineering team and constructively welcome code reviews.</li><li>  Customers: Comfortable talking to customers and assisting them with their technical issues and integration.</li><li>  Open source:&nbsp;We prefer developers who have contributed back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small.</li></ul><h4>****** NO AGENCIES PLEASE ******</h4></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United Kingdom</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>EU only, preferred in the UK</p></dd>        </dl>",
