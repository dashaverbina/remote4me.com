The infrastructures we manage support millions of pounds of transactions every month.</p><p>Working with other Scale Factory colleagues, you'll help to build and support customers' platforms, working with their engineers to put together a foundation of good DevOps practise, helping them move faster, maintain uptime, and keep their secrets safe and secure.</p><p>Most of our work centres around ReadyScale, our platform design for scalable cloud infrastructure. This is currently built mainly from Terraform, Puppet, AWS and Ruby.</p><p><strong>Teams</strong></p><p>Our <em>Platform Engineering</em> team works on ReadyScale, adding features, fixing bugs, and deploying it to our customers.</p><p>Our <em>Customer Engineering</em> team supports and maintains deployed ReadyScale platforms for our customers, rolling out security patches and deploying platform improvements as well as keeping on top of support queries.</p><p>We're hiring for both teams right now, and if you're not sure where you'd fit best, that's fine -&nbsp;we rotate people through the teams from time to time. Everyone takes part in the out-of-hours on call rota, even the directors!</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Attitude, flexibility, and the ability to learn new technologies quickly, are all more important than years of experience. However you'll need production experience with:</p><ul><li>AWS</li><li>Linux (either CentOS or Ubuntu)</li><li>Configuration management (preferably Puppet, but a CM mindset is more important than the specific tool)</li></ul><p>Experience with the following would also be beneficial, but not required: Jenkins, Terraform, Packer, ELK, Vagrant, Prometheus, Docker, Kubernetes. As dictated by client requirements, we work with a number of different language environments&nbsp;and application frameworks. We even have one customer still running COBOL.</p><p>Honestly, if you're not sure if you have the relevant experience for this job, get in touch anyway and we'll figure it out together.</p><p><strong>Other</strong></p><p>The salary range listed here is indicative - we'll make you an offer based on your location and experience.</p><p>We're not looking to work with&nbsp;recruiters&nbsp;to fill this role.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About The Scale Factory            </h2>            <div><p>The Scale Factory is a growing London-based consultancy. We design, build, operate, support and scale Linux infrastructure for clients of various sizes, across a number of business sectors.</p><p>We have an office near London Bridge, but we support remote working as long as you're within the UK; we encourage our team to make their own schedule with the hours that work best for them. That said, client visits (mostly London, but sometimes further afield) will occasionally be necessary, and some client engagements will influence the hours you'll need to be available - but most are pretty flexible around this too.</p><p>As well as monthly co-working days (one in London, one in Manchester), we bring the whole team together every couple of months for planning sessions, hack days, and socialising. We try to ensure that our social time is balanced and inclusive: we'll sometimes play board games in the office instead of just defaulting to&nbsp;a visit to the pub (though we do that from time to time too!)</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 25 days holiday per year                            </div>                            <div>                                 High spec Macbook or Thinkpad                            </div>                            <div>                                 Budget for conference attendance (incl. international travel)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Culture of inclusivity                            </div>                            <div>                                 Group life protection &amp; critical illness cover scheme                            </div>                            <div>                                 Mixture of on-site and remote work                            </div>                            <div>                                 Friendly colleagues, with a wealth of experience to share                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible working hours to suit you                            </div>                            <div>                                 Training and development opportunities                            </div>                    ",

    "content": "Our Reliability Engineers evolve and maintain applications and infrastructure for our customers. Scalability and proactive improvements are the focus and good communication skills – the necessity.<br /><br />*WHAT DOES THE JOB ENTAIL?*<br /><br />We primarily write and deliver custom software to our customers. We build solutions in a variety of languages and platforms, historically Ruby on Rails, we tend to use React, JavaScript, Elixir, and Clojure these days. We will usually be responsible for setting up a customer’s infrastructure on AWS with tools like Ansible and Terraform though sometimes we opt for a Platform as a Service like Heroku. We make sure there is a Continuous Delivery pipeline running our automated test suites before deploying changes.<br /><br />Our application and infrastructure lifetime support services are an important part of our business. Often once our delivery teams have built custom software, the applications and infrastructure will be on boarded into our lifetime support team. This team is responsible for the ongoing development of applications, adapting applications to changing requirements as our customers grow, and fixing problems as they arise. We also onboard some applications that our teams haven’t built if they pass our quality and maintainability audits.<br /><br />Reliability Engineers will split their time between responding to automated alerts, proactive codebase improvement, answering requests sent into our customer support desk, and ongoing feature development.<br /><br />This role requires less of a physical presence with customers and therefore it is our first fully remote engineering role. You are of course welcome to work from our offices rather than remote but the option is open. As previously mentioned, regular communication with customers is still a must.<br /><br />*WHAT EXPERIENCE ARE WE LOOKING FOR?*<br /><br />We’ll expect you to be a polyglot programmer versed in a mix of object and functional programming languages. We expect you to be able to jump into a project in a language, framework or configuration you’ve not worked in before and be able to fix issues, improve the codebase and build new features in it. Not only this but the right person would be adept in sharing their knowledge with others – we’d love to hear some examples of coaching and growing team members.<br /><br />Multitasking, or more accurately, prioritisation is a big part of being a Reliability Engineer. We expect you to be able to prioritise your work, be able to switch onto resolving emergencies without being told to, and keep all customers up to date.<br /><br />Code is only the half of it. The other half is communication. We expect you to be a great communicator with customers and colleagues in written and spoken English. Reliability Engineers keep in touch with customers mostly via Slack and Google Hangouts.<br /><br />Further required experience:<br /><br />* Debugging a range of applications<br />* Experience debugging infrastructure (AWS/Heroku/Linux/HTTP)<br />* Working directly with customers<br />* Writing code with Test Driven Development<br />* Pair programming as we pair around 50% of the time<br />* Agile practices such as Scrum, XP, and/or Kanban<br />* Working with a range of SQL and NoSQL databases<br />* Infrastructure as code tools such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and/or Saltstack<br /><br />Everything else is optional but highly sought after. We would love you to have experience in:<br /><br />* Writing code with Acceptance Test Driven Development<br />* Component based design techniques such as using pattern libraries, styled components, CSS-in-JS, BEM, and/or SUIT CSS<br />* The React ecosystem including a TDD approach<br /><br />*WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK AT MADE TECH?*<br /><br />We are a sanctuary for those wanting to hone their skills alongside like-minded learners. After joining our team it is common for new starters to comment on how much they’re learning and how much they enjoy the fact they are surrounded by people they can learn from. This includes our most senior hires.<br /><br />The biggest thing you’ll take away from our culture after spending the day with us would be that we practice continuous improvement at every level. Everyone has peer-based one-to-ones every 2 weeks, along with monthly one-to-ones with a director. Teams have fortnightly retrospectives. We also hold a company wide retrospective fortnightly. We discuss our problems out in the open, and rather than punish failure we band together to find solutions.<br /><br />Other notable things:<br /><br />* Every Friday afternoon is dedicated to learning new skills<br />* Everyone is encouraged to write blog posts regularly<br />* Our handbook is open sourced<br />* We are vegan and non-drinker friendly as well as meat-eater and drinker friendly<br />* Retreats and trips every year<br /><br />We also offer the following benefits:<br /><br />* Annual Performance Bonus<br />* Company Credit Card<br />* Remote Working<br />* Travel loan and cycle to work<br />* Untracked Holiday<br />* Team Lunches<br />* Brand new Macbook Pro<br />* Employee assistance programme (free finance/legal advice and phone counselling)<br /><br />You can see our open sourced &quot;company handbook&quot;:https://github.com/madetech/handbook for more information.",

You probably use Dropbox or a similar service on a daily basis. Now imagine a service where customers upload entire email databases, nested zip files, images in every conceivable format (and some inconceivable), hard drive exports, and other content described as “anything and everything.” Logikcull customers need to understand this data quickly and thoroughly. Simple enough. Put it in S3, right? But here’s the catch, unlike Dropbox, Logikcull must rip the data apart, analyze metadata and text and then restructure it so that legal teams around the world can navigate complex discovery matters. Existing discovery solutions are tired and insufficient. Logikcull is truly something different.</div><div><br></div><div>This of course requires massive computing, storage, and supporting infrastructure that will surely feel small 6 months from now. Our technical challenges are both broad and deep. Emails have attachments and exist in threaded conversations. A Word document might be a simple letter or embed presentations or even entire email archives (yep, seen it) Almost anything can be printed to PDF.</div><div><br></div><div>Logikcull is a complex web application that sits on top of a distributed document processing pipeline that handles millions of documents and multiple terabytes of data each month. Current customer growth trends mean we have some serious infrastructure work ahead of us. You are important because we need help on multiple fronts. We must expand document processing capacity and performance, increase system reliability, and improve our security posture. Customers in 34 different countries (and counting) are depending on us.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>It’s controlled chaos at scale and we love it. Here’s why:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The technical challenges are staggering, but the potential impact even small changes can have is incredibly motivating. Last month we shaved 8.5 seconds off of an important document processing step. Multiply that by 10’s of millions of documents and the impact is enormous. Engineers will find opportunities like this over and over.</div><div><br></div><div>The impact Logikcull is having on our society is likely even more rewarding. For example, our government customers are now responding to open records requests (i.e. FOIA), in days, not months or years (yep, not kidding) by using Logikcull. Citizens lawfully requesting and receiving government information in a timely fashion is crucial for our democracy. We’re committed to making this process better every day.</div><div><br></div><div>Similarly, we’re committed to changing the economics and logistics of discovery in litigation, which is often prohibitively expensive and complicated for those who need it the most. Logikcull makes it easy, fast, and affordable for anyone to participate in the discovery process. To us, litigation is sometimes required to affect positive change (<a href='http://logikcull.com/blog/into-the-wild-earthjustice-amanda-sharp/' rel='nofollow'>see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves, not a joke</a>) Discovery should not be weaponized. Access to justice should not be means-tested.</div><div><br></div><div>These are some of the reasons we do it. Do any of them speak to you?
