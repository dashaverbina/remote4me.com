One in five fruits and vegetables grown in America never make it off the farm due to tiny cosmetic defects that do not affect quality, often causing them to go to waste. Imperfect is on a mission to find a home for these fruits and veggies by selling them for a 30-50% discount with a lovable, hip brand. We offer the most affordable and environmentally-responsible produce option, starting with our weekly produce delivery service across the Bay Area, Los Angeles, Portland, Seattle, and Chicago. In addition to building a scalable solution to fight food waste, our business model also generates extra revenue to farmers. Imperfect has raised significant investment and has been featured in major publications including the New York Times, PBS NewsHour, NPR, Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune, and the front page of National Geographic. We have put together a team of the leading food waste entrepreneurs in the country and are working with a team of world-class advisors, including Doug Rauch, former President of Trader Joe’s.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Free produce, Bevi, and kombucha!                            </div>                            <div>                                 MacBook Air Laptops                            </div>                            <div>                                 Health Care (Kaiser or Blue Shield)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Vacation Days                            </div>                            <div>                                 Ping Pong and Foosball tables                            </div>                            <div>                                 Equal Opportunity Employer                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commuter Benefits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Sit/Stand Desks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Stock Options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Bonus                            </div>                    ",

You won't find any unicorn glitter or exponential curves around here, just a real company with a sustainable business which has been profitable from year 1 and has been growing healthily ever since. Currently our Annual Recurring Revenue is just over <strong>$930,000</strong> - and annual net revenue is over <strong>$1.1million</strong>. We're very transparent about our mission and our metrics, you can <a href='https://ghost.org/about/' rel='nofollow'>read all about us</a>.</p><p>Ghost is a full stack web application for running independent publications. It’s one of the most popular modern open source projects in the world, and is used in production by tens of thousands of websites and companies.</p><p>Chances are you've already visited and read sites which run on Ghost. Our users range from hugely popular bloggers like <strong>Jeff Atwood, Troy Hunt</strong> and <strong>Joel Gascoigne</strong> - all the way through to some of the world's largest organisations like <strong>Square, DuckDuckGo, Open AI, CloudFlare, Digital Ocean, Mozilla, Napster, Tinder, OkCupid</strong> and <a href='https://ghost.org/customers' rel='nofollow'>many, many more</a>.</p><p>Ghost as a business is made up of two primary products:</p><ul><li><a href='https://github.com/tryghost/ghost' rel='nofollow'>Ghost</a> - An open source CMS/app which can be used for free by anyone</li><li><a href='https://ghost.org/pricing/' rel='nofollow'>Ghost(Pro)</a> - A fully managed hosting platform with powerful automation</li></ul><p>The hosting platform is targeted at professional/business users, which in turn funds the entire company to build free, open source software for everyone.</p><p>As the company grows, we’re looking for an experienced infrastructure engineer to join the team and lead the development of our <strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong> platform and services. This is a senior role reporting directly to Ghost’s CTO, <a href='https://github.com/erisds' rel='nofollow'>Hannah</a>, with plenty of freedom and control to architect a real production system which is already serving over 100million requests a month - with a ton of room for improvement.</p><h5>What we're looking for</h5><p>All of our infrastructure and systems have gone through several iterations, but have ultimately been built by a small/scrappy team of passionate developers without significant prior sysadmin experience. Our platform these days is pretty solid, but it took us a long time and a lot of trial and error to get here. What we’re looking for now is someone who is comfortable and confident in leading our architecture and taking it to the next level.</p><p>For this position, we're explicitly looking for someone experienced (5+ years sysadmin experience, minimum) and confident in taking on a broad set of responsibilities managing, deploying and maintaining complex projects across several different environments.</p><p>Extensive experience in systems management and automation is a must. <strong>Experience specifically relating to web hosting at scale, continuous integration, monitoring and performance management is a huge advantage.</strong> Previous remote work and startup experience is also very valuable.</p><p>Our infrastructure is comprised of about 100 servers across two DigitalOcean datacenters, running Ubuntu and managed with Saltstack, sitting behind a fairly deep Cloudflare CDN integration. Most common tech across our instances includes MariaDB, Nginx and Phusion Passenger, LXC, Gluster and a whole lot of JavaScript.</p><p>This role requires someone who is exceptional at clear, frequent communication - in particular around quickly identifying and responding to infrastructure failures, as well as…</p><ul><li>Analysing infrastructure requirements and optimisations based on app performance and user load scenarios.</li><li>Database clustering and replication management.</li><li>Monitoring and alert management.</li><li>Common security issues and mitigation strategies.</li></ul><p>Leading our infrastructure is the base which the rest of the team builds on top of, so it is easily one of the most significant and important roles in the entire company.</p><p>People who are great at written communication and highly self-motivated tend to do best at Ghost. The majority of the team is made up of former founders, freelancers and self-starters who are confident and comfortable working independently and getting things done.</p><p>This role would be well suited to someone in an existing ops team at a fast-paced technology company looking for a more senior position where they’re able to have more control and leadership of systems architecture across an entire organisation. There are a lot of opportunities for growth here as the team expands.</p><p>We don't mind where you're based or what hours you work, but this role does require reasonable working-hours overlap with the rest of our internal/ops engineering team in Europe, as well as availability to be on-call on a rotating schedule in the event of downtime.</p><p>We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We have as many people who speak German as we do English and our engineering team contains as many women as it does men. Some of us are single, others are married, while others are parents. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.</p><h5>What it's like to work here</h5><p>The vast majority of our work gets done on Github, with Slack as the main channel for communication. We do a weekly meetings via Zoom which are used to discuss progress and plan what's coming next.</p><p>The biggest perk of working at Ghost is that we have a small, talented team with a very large audience. This means you have the ability to have a huge impact on the product and the company, whilst also having really interesting and challenging problems to work on. We believe deeply in what we do, and we're all in this to build something lasting, sustainable and positive.</p><p>On top of all that, we try to treat people pretty well. All roles at Ghost come with:</p><ul><li><strong>Competitive salary</strong><ul><li>We pay very well at market rates reflecting both location and experience.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fully remote work</strong><ul><li>Work from anywhere in the world, or travel continuously if that's your thing. Everything we do is online. As long as you have wifi, you're all set.</li></ul></li><li><strong>All the tech you need</strong><ul><li>We'll pay for whatever hardware and software you need to work and make sure you're regularly upgraded to the latest versions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Office costs covered</strong><ul><li>Whether you prefer a home office or a co-working space, we'll help pay for it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Personal development</strong><ul><li>An annual budget for books, courses, conferences and travel expenses.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Twice annual international team retreats</strong><ul><li>Every 6 months we get the whole crew together for a week away. The last few trips have taken us to Dubai, Thailand, Austria &amp; Egypt.</li></ul></li><li><strong>3 day weekends, all year long</strong><ul><li>We close the office on the last Friday of every single month. Enjoy!</li></ul></li><li><strong>Unlimited paid vacation</strong><ul><li>Minimum 2 weeks per year, if you don't take it yourself, we kick you out of the office in December until the new year rolls around.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Paid parental leave</strong><ul><li>When the time comes to welcome a new member of the family, we offer 3 months fully paid parental leave.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Guaranteed pay-rises</strong><ul><li>Everyone at Ghost receives a minimum 5% pay increase each year to reward loyalty and offset the cost of inflation.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Dog friendly office</strong><ul><li>Just kidding we literally don't have an office - but apparently tech companies think is an important detail to put on job descriptions and we didn't want to feel left out. So, um. Feel free to work with your dog.</li></ul></li></ul><h5>How to apply</h5><p>We don't hire people often, and positions rarely open up. We're pretty proud that in the 5 years since Ghost started nobody has ever quit. So when we do add a member to the team, we're pretty diligent about it. This is a very different attitude to most companies.</p><p>We’re profitable, we have unlimited runway, and extremely healthy revenue growth. There is no investor pressure or time limit or need to hire as many people as fast as possible to fill a fancy office. We want to keep the team as small as we can, automate as much as possible with robots, build great software, and enjoy our work as much as possible. Those are the things we optimise for. If that sounds like a good fit for you, then we’d encourage you to get in touch.</p><p>All jobs at Ghost start with an application form, progressing to 1-2 short phone interviews, and finally a paid trial project.</p><p>Rather than trying to guess if we'll work well together based on lengthy arbitrary interview questions or &quot;code challenges&quot; - instead we invite promising candidates to work on a real life trial project with us and pay them for their time. Trial projects are typically 20-30 hours of work, and give us an opportunity to get to know each other prior to pursuing a full time offer. It’s also a chance for candidates to get to know the Ghost team and make sure that it’s a good fit for them.</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>Anywhere</p></dd>        </dl>",

You will leverage your expertise to challenge our assumptions about the reliability of our deployment and the effectiveness of our processes as we strive to improve.&nbsp;</p><p><br>DuckDuckGo is a remote company and our employees live all over the world! We empower our team with personal autonomy on team projects. This means you must be self-directed and self-motivated to succeed.

You like to take initiative in pushing a project forward but can make adjustments based on team feedback.</li><li>Someone who will put the user first in on-call and project work.</li><li>Strong communication skills. You can validate and communicate your decisions clearly.</li></ul><p><br><strong>Other things to know:</strong></p><ul><li>We are a small, remote team in different time zones and communicate with a variety of tools throughout the day.

All team members have opportunities to run projects.</li><li>All projects are run transparently, and we encourage everyone to participate in areas of interest throughout the company.&nbsp; Anyone and everyone can (and should) ask questions and offer feedback around the product and internal projects.</li><li>We try to exemplify our values (build trust, question assumptions, and validate direction) in everything we do.</li></ul><p>If you think you might thrive in this environment, we would love to hear from you using the application below.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About DuckDuckGo            </h2>            <div><p><a href='https://duckduckgo.com/about' rel='nofollow'>https://duckduckgo.com/about</a></p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Unlimited vacation                            </div>                            <div>                                 Generous vacation guidelines                            </div>                            <div>                                 Family leave policy                            </div>                            <div>                                 Co-working reimbursement                            </div>                            <div>                                 Remote work                            </div>                            <div>                                 Company and team meetups                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wellness and learning benefits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Company wide hack days                            </div>                    ",

In addition to the basic imageboard features we would need:- An application system: Admins and moderators can accept or reject applications.Accept: Send a welcome email with a link to create the user.Reject: Send a comment about the application in email and offer a chance to edit it/try again.- Privatecommunity: cut off all connections to the board if the user is not logged in. Frontpage would have info about the site, login form (+ password retrieval), links to the application and discord server.- Administration: Easy page to manage applications, reported posts, users, bans etc.- Discord authentication: Users should authenticate to the internal discord channels / role automatically or manually so that when the application is accepted there would be instructions in the account settings on how to do it for example. a command with a discord bot or something like that.- Mobile compatibility- Generate invite codes or links for individual or X old users that can be used to register without application.</p><p>This is not all, but the most important ones.</p><p>Budget is 500€ but note: this is not for someone doing the usual paid work. This is for someone who is interested in the project, wants to help and possibly learn something in the process.</p><p>Our purpose is to create a private community type imageboard with a support network that can also help people dealing with depression, social alienation and mental health problems that are increasing globally especially in the youth.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

Distributed systems engineer Node.js & Go (remote)<br />h3(=alted). <br />Job description<br /><br /><br />*What makes Ably special?*<br /><br />Ably helps power next generation digital experiences. Ones which are live rather than static, where data is in motion rather than at rest. <br />Things like live chat, realtime location tracking, live document collaboration, gaming and elearning. Customers include Tennis Australia, OfferUp, Yahoo, and even an air traffic control system for drones.<br />Working at Ably means you are working on a cutting-edge truly distributed product that is helping build the future.<br /> <br />*What we can offer you - in brief*<br /><br />You will learn with the best. You will have autonomy and freedom to experiment and improve. You will be part of a dynamic team and a business that is taking off.  We have just &quot;completed a $1m financing round to fuel our growth&quot;:http://www.eu-startups.com/2017/07/london-based-ably-raises-1-million-to-deliver-next-generation-realtime-digital-experiences/. We have the best technology, and the &quot;best people&quot;:https://www.ably.io/about/team in the industry.  <br />Join us now and you'll be early in at a business going places, you'll learn a lot, you'll work with the founding team, and you'll have fun.<br /><br />*What we want in return  -  in brief*<br />We want someone smart, ambitious, curious and motivated. Someone is prepared to do their best and work their arse off to do great work and become outstanding at what they do.<br /> <br />*Job description*<br />You'll be working with a deeply technical engineering team who collectively bring a wealth of experience and broad technology skills. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites us each day and motivates us each.  If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably.  Our team is made up of a strong remote contingent, however our base is in London and growing. We are strong believers in face-to-face communication where possible. Whilst this is a remote working role, being able to practically travel to London occasionally is highly preferable and working on a similar time zone is a must.<br /> <br />*Day to day you can expect to be working on:*<br /><br />* The &quot;core&quot; realtime platform which is largely Node.js and Go. You will also be required to work on the various services and routing layers of the platform which are built in Go and Elixir (we would expect you to be comfortable in either Go or Elixir, both would be a big win). As an aside, we use Ruby for all infrastructure automation and orchestration and occasionally write lower-level native code where necessary (such as native modules for Node). We're always revisiting the technologies we use and are always open to using new technologies where suitable.<br />* Working within the realtime platform and solving distributed programming problems. &quot;Find out what it takes to be a distributed systems engineer&quot;:https://blog.ably.io/what-is-a-distributed-systems-engineer-f6c1d921acf8. <br />* Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.<br />* Diagnosing and fixing bugs in our platform using distributed tracing techniques.<br />* Adding suitable test coverage to new features as well as existing functionality, conducting load tests using our frameworks, and generally helping to address platform stability and regression prevention.<br />* Be responsible for the complete lifecycle of your features and code i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments with ownership of any issues that arise.  We are strong believers in all developers being involved in the system operations as well.<br />* Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products.  All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.<br />* Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.<br />* Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.<br />* Suggestions for new features or improvements to &quot;our protocol and API specifications&quot;:https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/.<br /><br /> <br />*Benefits*<br /><br />* Salary range: €40k to €85k. Depends entirely on skills and experience.<br />* Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays. Can be negotiated.<br />* Benefit from a truly flexible working environment in which remote working and managing your own working time is the norm.<br />* Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about. <br />* Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.<br />* Work with genuinely nice people who care.<br /><br />h3(=alted). <br />Requirements<br /><br /><br />* Experience: A minimum of a three years of professional experience in Node.js. Go and/or Elixir experience is very beneficial. You must have experience using both statically and dynamically typed languages, ideally in at least one other language. Any exposure to realtime and distributed systems is a real advantage. An understanding of Ruby is beneficial in regards to infrastructure automation and tooling, but not necessary.<br />* Pragmatic: A problem solver excited by the prospect of working autonomously solve problems and bring solutions to the team.<br />* Fast Learner: We're looking for software engineers who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies.  Our stack is diverse, and we expect it to continue to grow.<br />* Testing: Experience using testing frameworks and adoption of test driven development where applicable.<br />* Infrastructure: Experience with infrastructure and distributed systems is beneficial.<br />* Communication: We use tools such as Slack throughout the day to communicate, however we believe in voice conversations to discuss and solve problems. You must be proficient in spoken and written English, be eager to collaborate with the engineering team and constructively welcome code reviews.<br />* Customers: Comfortable talking to customers and assisting them with their technical issues and integration.<br />* Open source: We prefer developers who have contributed back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small. <br /><br /><br />h3.

We do this through a REST/JSON API, a well thought-out architecture and intricate knowledge of the payment systems that govern all of our life. We are growing fast and are executing a huge opportunity for the company with a number of big name customers now in the pipeline.</p><p>We have a very diverse team (over 20 nationalities) consisting of 50+ people.</p><p>I (the person posting this) have just recently taken on theresponsibility of CTO and was positively surprised by the culture I already found in the existing team. I am now continuing to foster it. optile is firmly based on mutual respect, hiring smart people and getting out of their way (aka taking responsibility), honest feedback and transparency. Work here is challenging, but also fun and I personally focus on creating a team of happy humans who build great software. We pay competitive wages and have a good track record of providing incentives through equity for all employees. There are free soft drinks, beer, coffee and fruit.</p><p>We do have remote positions available in building payment method adapters, as the adapter team is the one that has most experience and the cultural tenets to work remotely, but the core team and the company is still local to Munich. One thing can lead to another, though.</p><p>That said, we are looking for:- Java developers of all kinds (junior, senior, you name it). The adapter developer position mentioned above needs more of a &quot;senior&quot; profile.- ReactJS/Redux/ReactNative developers (junior, senior, you name it)- Internal IT Administrator (preferably a generalist with an interest in everything and experience in structuring heterogeneous systems and herding cats)- Quality Assurance Lead (big focus on automation, but also taking a holistic view of the end-to-end product experience)</p><p>We are also looking for candidates in &quot;not typically HackerNews&quot; positions. We have openings for working students and in marketing and sales.</p><p>Experience with MongoDB, Spring, PostgreSQL, Lodash, D3.js, Vertx, perhaps a little bit of OSGi (yeah, we know, we're moving away from it), a good understanding of cryptography, previous payment experience, risk models and machine learning are all a plus.</p><p>If anything of the above sounds good to you, please click the above link and send us your CV :).<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",
