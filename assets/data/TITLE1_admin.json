Server must be optimized, secured and taken care of atleast until i learn all the necessary tasks or find a second admin. For an expert these shouldn't be too demanding and none of the coresystems have to be programmed from scratch unless the person wants to but shared imageboard software like <a href='https://github.com/fallenPineapple/NPFchan' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/fallenPineapple/NPFchan</a> , <a href='https://github.com/kennell/imageboards' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/kennell/imageboards</a> can be used as a base or model.

In addition to the basic imageboard features we would need:- An application system: Admins and moderators can accept or reject applications.Accept: Send a welcome email with a link to create the user.Reject: Send a comment about the application in email and offer a chance to edit it/try again.- Privatecommunity: cut off all connections to the board if the user is not logged in. Frontpage would have info about the site, login form (+ password retrieval), links to the application and discord server.- Administration: Easy page to manage applications, reported posts, users, bans etc.- Discord authentication: Users should authenticate to the internal discord channels / role automatically or manually so that when the application is accepted there would be instructions in the account settings on how to do it for example. a command with a discord bot or something like that.- Mobile compatibility- Generate invite codes or links for individual or X old users that can be used to register without application.</p><p>This is not all, but the most important ones.</p><p>Budget is 500€ but note: this is not for someone doing the usual paid work.

    "content": "h2(=title). Distributed systems engineer Node.js & Go (remote)<br />h3(=alted). <br />Job description<br /><br /><br />*What makes Ably special?*<br /><br />Ably helps power next generation digital experiences. Ones which are live rather than static, where data is in motion rather than at rest. <br />Things like live chat, realtime location tracking, live document collaboration, gaming and elearning. Customers include Tennis Australia, OfferUp, Yahoo, and even an air traffic control system for drones.<br />Working at Ably means you are working on a cutting-edge truly distributed product that is helping build the future.<br /> <br />*What we can offer you - in brief*<br /><br />You will learn with the best. You will have autonomy and freedom to experiment and improve. You will be part of a dynamic team and a business that is taking off.  We have just &quot;completed a $1m financing round to fuel our growth&quot;:http://www.eu-startups.com/2017/07/london-based-ably-raises-1-million-to-deliver-next-generation-realtime-digital-experiences/. We have the best technology, and the &quot;best people&quot;:https://www.ably.io/about/team in the industry.  <br />Join us now and you'll be early in at a business going places, you'll learn a lot, you'll work with the founding team, and you'll have fun.<br /><br />*What we want in return  -  in brief*<br />We want someone smart, ambitious, curious and motivated. Someone is prepared to do their best and work their arse off to do great work and become outstanding at what they do.<br /> <br />*Job description*<br />You'll be working with a deeply technical engineering team who collectively bring a wealth of experience and broad technology skills. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites us each day and motivates us each.  If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably.  Our team is made up of a strong remote contingent, however our base is in London and growing. We are strong believers in face-to-face communication where possible. Whilst this is a remote working role, being able to practically travel to London occasionally is highly preferable and working on a similar time zone is a must.<br /> <br />*Day to day you can expect to be working on:*<br /><br />* The &quot;core&quot; realtime platform which is largely Node.js and Go. You will also be required to work on the various services and routing layers of the platform which are built in Go and Elixir (we would expect you to be comfortable in either Go or Elixir, both would be a big win). As an aside, we use Ruby for all infrastructure automation and orchestration and occasionally write lower-level native code where necessary (such as native modules for Node). We're always revisiting the technologies we use and are always open to using new technologies where suitable.<br />* Working within the realtime platform and solving distributed programming problems. &quot;Find out what it takes to be a distributed systems engineer&quot;:https://blog.ably.io/what-is-a-distributed-systems-engineer-f6c1d921acf8. <br />* Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.<br />* Diagnosing and fixing bugs in our platform using distributed tracing techniques.<br />* Adding suitable test coverage to new features as well as existing functionality, conducting load tests using our frameworks, and generally helping to address platform stability and regression prevention.<br />* Be responsible for the complete lifecycle of your features and code i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments with ownership of any issues that arise.  We are strong believers in all developers being involved in the system operations as well.<br />* Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products.  All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.<br />* Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.<br />* Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.<br />* Suggestions for new features or improvements to &quot;our protocol and API specifications&quot;:https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/.<br /><br /> <br />*Benefits*<br /><br />* Salary range: €40k to €85k. Depends entirely on skills and experience.<br />* Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays. Can be negotiated.<br />* Benefit from a truly flexible working environment in which remote working and managing your own working time is the norm.<br />* Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about. <br />* Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.<br />* Work with genuinely nice people who care.<br /><br />h3(=alted). <br />Requirements<br /><br /><br />* Experience: A minimum of a three years of professional experience in Node.js. Go and/or Elixir experience is very beneficial. You must have experience using both statically and dynamically typed languages, ideally in at least one other language. Any exposure to realtime and distributed systems is a real advantage. An understanding of Ruby is beneficial in regards to infrastructure automation and tooling, but not necessary.<br />* Pragmatic: A problem solver excited by the prospect of working autonomously solve problems and bring solutions to the team.<br />* Fast Learner: We're looking for software engineers who thrive on applying their knowledge, learning new technologies.  Our stack is diverse, and we expect it to continue to grow.<br />* Testing: Experience using testing frameworks and adoption of test driven development where applicable.<br />* Infrastructure: Experience with infrastructure and distributed systems is beneficial.<br />* Communication: We use tools such as Slack throughout the day to communicate, however we believe in voice conversations to discuss and solve problems. You must be proficient in spoken and written English, be eager to collaborate with the engineering team and constructively welcome code reviews.<br />* Customers: Comfortable talking to customers and assisting them with their technical issues and integration.<br />* Open source: We prefer developers who have contributed back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small. <br /><br /><br />h3.

Customers include Tennis Australia, OfferUp, Yahoo, and even an air traffic control system for drones.<br>Working at Ably means you are working on a cutting-edge truly distributed product that is helping build the future.</p><p><strong>What we can offer you – in brief</strong></p><p>You will learn with the best.

Someone is prepared to do their best and work their arse off to do great work and become outstanding at what they do.</p><p><strong>Job description</strong></p><p>You'll be working with a deeply technical engineering team who collectively bring a wealth of experience and broad technology skills. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites us each day and motivates us each. &nbsp;If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably. &nbsp;Our team is made up of a strong remote contingent, however our base is in London and growing. We are strong believers in face-to-face communication where possible. Whilst this is a remote working role, being able to practically travel to London occasionally is highly preferable and working on a similar time zone is a must.</p><p>Day to day you can expect to be working on:</p><ul><li>  The &quot;core&quot; realtime platform which is largely Node.js and Go. You will also be required to work on the various services and routing layers of the platform which are built in Go and Elixir (we would expect you to be comfortable in either Go or Elixir, both would be a big win). As an aside, we use Ruby for all infrastructure automation and orchestration and occasionally write lower-level native code where necessary (such as native modules for Node). We're always revisiting the technologies we use and are always open to using new technologies where suitable.</li><li>  Working within the realtime platform and solving distributed programming problems.&nbsp;<a href='https://blog.ably.io/what-is-a-distributed-systems-engineer-f6c1d921acf8' rel='nofollow'>Find out what it takes to be a distributed systems engineer</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>  Collaborating with the team to design, discuss and implement new features and services.</li><li>  Diagnosing and fixing bugs in our platform using distributed tracing techniques.</li><li>  Adding suitable test coverage to new features as well as existing functionality, conducting load tests using our frameworks, and generally helping to address platform stability and regression prevention.</li><li>  Be responsible for the complete lifecycle of your features and code i.e. pull request, reviews, testing, deploy to staging and sandbox environments, then into production environments with ownership of any issues that arise.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are strong believers in all developers being involved in the system operations as well.</li><li>  Contributing to open source projects that we support or use in our products. &nbsp;All of our client libraries are open source as well and may require your support at times.</li><li>  Helping customers solve problems they are experiencing that may help us find bugs in the platform.</li><li>  Support the wider team in regards to documentation and customer support.</li><li>  Suggestions for new features or improvements to <a href='https://docs.ably.io/client-lib-development-guide/' rel='nofollow'>our protocol and API specifications</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>  Salary range:&nbsp;€40k to €85k. Depends entirely on skills and experience.</li><li>  Holidays: 25+ days excluding national holidays. Can be negotiated.</li><li>  Benefit from a truly flexible working environment in which remote working and managing your own working time is the norm.</li><li>  Work in an environment where code quality, technical challenges and delivery is what we all care about.&nbsp;</li><li>  Skills development is intrinsic in the job. We're largely working on unsolved problems each day, and such, there is plenty of scope to widen your knowledge and skillset.</li><li>  Work with genuinely nice people who care.</li></ul><p><strong>**** NO AGENCIES PLEASE **</strong>**</p></dd>          <dt></dt>            <dd>              <p>                              </p>            </dd>          <dt><span>Country</span></dt>          <dd><p>United Kingdom</p></dd>            <dt><span>Location</span></dt>            <dd><p>Within Europe</p></dd>        </dl>",

We do this through a REST/JSON API, a well thought-out architecture and intricate knowledge of the payment systems that govern all of our life. We are growing fast and are executing a huge opportunity for the company with a number of big name customers now in the pipeline.</p><p>We have a very diverse team (over 20 nationalities) consisting of 50+ people.</p><p>I (the person posting this) have just recently taken on theresponsibility of CTO and was positively surprised by the culture I already found in the existing team. I am now continuing to foster it. optile is firmly based on mutual respect, hiring smart people and getting out of their way (aka taking responsibility), honest feedback and transparency. Work here is challenging, but also fun and I personally focus on creating a team of happy humans who build great software. We pay competitive wages and have a good track record of providing incentives through equity for all employees. There are free soft drinks, beer, coffee and fruit.</p><p>We do have remote positions available in building payment method adapters, as the adapter team is the one that has most experience and the cultural tenets to work remotely, but the core team and the company is still local to Munich. One thing can lead to another, though.</p><p>That said, we are looking for:- Java developers of all kinds (junior, senior, you name it). The adapter developer position mentioned above needs more of a &quot;senior&quot; profile.- ReactJS/Redux/ReactNative developers (junior, senior, you name it)- Internal IT Administrator (preferably a generalist with an interest in everything and experience in structuring heterogeneous systems and herding cats)- Quality Assurance Lead (big focus on automation, but also taking a holistic view of the end-to-end product experience)</p><p>We are also looking for candidates in &quot;not typically HackerNews&quot; positions. We have openings for working students and in marketing and sales.</p><p>Experience with MongoDB, Spring, PostgreSQL, Lodash, D3.js, Vertx, perhaps a little bit of OSGi (yeah, we know, we're moving away from it), a good understanding of cryptography, previous payment experience, risk models and machine learning are all a plus.</p><p>If anything of the above sounds good to you, please click the above link and send us your CV :).<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",

If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us. </p><p>The role:</p><p>Are you looking for the next frontier and challenge where you can apply your expertise in penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, and threat modeling?  Smart contracts are programs on a blockchain: they never go down, cannot be changed, and run as programmed.  These smart contracts directly control money, so you can see that their security is critical.</p><p>ConsenSys is a development pioneer of the Ethereum ecosystem and many of our tools such as Truffle, INFURA, MetaMask, BlockApps, are among the most widely adopted globally.  With ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.</p><p>ConsenSys is expanding its efforts on smart contract security to meet the needs of enterprise clients as well as home-grown platforms ranging from prediction markets to decentralized crowdfunding, including uPort, Gnosis, Stabl, WeiFund, and Virtue Poker.  Our aim is to build the most technically-gifted and engineering-focused blockchain security team.</p><p>We are looking to hire someone with a passion for Solidity, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and security.  Candidates should relish in technical subtleties and minutiae, and have a passion for combining them with a flair for creativity and insight to hack smart contracts.</p><p>A significant part of the work can be done remotely wherever you are; little travel is anticipated (most of the technical team works remotely around the world). There's also opportunity to stay ahead of demand and lead and build out this team in case that's also of interest. This will be an engineering-first development organization, with the autonomy to manage itself in a manner conducive to software development excellence. It will be rigorous, demanding and not for everyone. We are looking for exceptionally intellectual, bright and technically driven individuals. We will be addressing challenges that have not been encountered before while borrowing from patterns in previous software architectures.</p><p>Qualifications</p><p>Minimum qualifications:</p><p>1 year demonstrated expertise with Solidity, the EVM, and blockchain</p><p>3 years of relevant work experience.</p><p>BS degree in a relevant field or equivalent practical experience.</p><p>Coding/scripting experience in one or more general purpose languages.</p><p>Preferred qualification:</p><p>Demonstrated expertise and contributions towards smart contract security, EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals), or research.</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience analyzing the security of systems (penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, etc.).</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience, including experience in responding to security problems in target-rich environments, looking at security alerts, front-line analysis and response.</p><p>Programming experience in Python, C/C++, Java, or Go.</p><p>Advanced degree (MS, PhD) in relevant field is a plus.</p><p>Who We are, some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:</p><p>The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.</p><p>A dynamic startup environment with runway. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization. At ConsenSys, the runway allows you to focus on what you do best without worrying about the runway.</p><p>Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new technologies, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</p><p>Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much work to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users. </p><p>ConsenSys was just named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators report.</p></div>",

    "title": "Reliability Engineer",
    "content": "Our Reliability Engineers evolve and maintain applications and infrastructure for our customers. Scalability and proactive improvements are the focus and good communication skills – the necessity.<br /><br />*WHAT DOES THE JOB ENTAIL?*<br /><br />We primarily write and deliver custom software to our customers. We build solutions in a variety of languages and platforms, historically Ruby on Rails, we tend to use React, JavaScript, Elixir, and Clojure these days. We will usually be responsible for setting up a customer’s infrastructure on AWS with tools like Ansible and Terraform though sometimes we opt for a Platform as a Service like Heroku. We make sure there is a Continuous Delivery pipeline running our automated test suites before deploying changes.<br /><br />Our application and infrastructure lifetime support services are an important part of our business. Often once our delivery teams have built custom software, the applications and infrastructure will be on boarded into our lifetime support team. This team is responsible for the ongoing development of applications, adapting applications to changing requirements as our customers grow, and fixing problems as they arise. We also onboard some applications that our teams haven’t built if they pass our quality and maintainability audits.<br /><br />Reliability Engineers will split their time between responding to automated alerts, proactive codebase improvement, answering requests sent into our customer support desk, and ongoing feature development.<br /><br />This role requires less of a physical presence with customers and therefore it is our first fully remote engineering role. You are of course welcome to work from our offices rather than remote but the option is open. As previously mentioned, regular communication with customers is still a must.<br /><br />*WHAT EXPERIENCE ARE WE LOOKING FOR?*<br /><br />We’ll expect you to be a polyglot programmer versed in a mix of object and functional programming languages. We expect you to be able to jump into a project in a language, framework or configuration you’ve not worked in before and be able to fix issues, improve the codebase and build new features in it. Not only this but the right person would be adept in sharing their knowledge with others – we’d love to hear some examples of coaching and growing team members.<br /><br />Multitasking, or more accurately, prioritisation is a big part of being a Reliability Engineer. We expect you to be able to prioritise your work, be able to switch onto resolving emergencies without being told to, and keep all customers up to date.<br /><br />Code is only the half of it. The other half is communication. We expect you to be a great communicator with customers and colleagues in written and spoken English. Reliability Engineers keep in touch with customers mostly via Slack and Google Hangouts.<br /><br />Further required experience:<br /><br />* Debugging a range of applications<br />* Experience debugging infrastructure (AWS/Heroku/Linux/HTTP)<br />* Working directly with customers<br />* Writing code with Test Driven Development<br />* Pair programming as we pair around 50% of the time<br />* Agile practices such as Scrum, XP, and/or Kanban<br />* Working with a range of SQL and NoSQL databases<br />* Infrastructure as code tools such as Ansible, Chef, Puppet, and/or Saltstack<br /><br />Everything else is optional but highly sought after. We would love you to have experience in:<br /><br />* Writing code with Acceptance Test Driven Development<br />* Component based design techniques such as using pattern libraries, styled components, CSS-in-JS, BEM, and/or SUIT CSS<br />* The React ecosystem including a TDD approach<br /><br />*WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK AT MADE TECH?*<br /><br />We are a sanctuary for those wanting to hone their skills alongside like-minded learners. After joining our team it is common for new starters to comment on how much they’re learning and how much they enjoy the fact they are surrounded by people they can learn from. This includes our most senior hires.<br /><br />The biggest thing you’ll take away from our culture after spending the day with us would be that we practice continuous improvement at every level. Everyone has peer-based one-to-ones every 2 weeks, along with monthly one-to-ones with a director. Teams have fortnightly retrospectives. We also hold a company wide retrospective fortnightly. We discuss our problems out in the open, and rather than punish failure we band together to find solutions.<br /><br />Other notable things:<br /><br />* Every Friday afternoon is dedicated to learning new skills<br />* Everyone is encouraged to write blog posts regularly<br />* Our handbook is open sourced<br />* We are vegan and non-drinker friendly as well as meat-eater and drinker friendly<br />* Retreats and trips every year<br /><br />We also offer the following benefits:<br /><br />* Annual Performance Bonus<br />* Company Credit Card<br />* Remote Working<br />* Travel loan and cycle to work<br />* Untracked Holiday<br />* Team Lunches<br />* Brand new Macbook Pro<br />* Employee assistance programme (free finance/legal advice and phone counselling)<br /><br />You can see our open sourced &quot;company handbook&quot;:https://github.com/madetech/handbook for more information.",

    "content": "<div>  <div>    <h2>Senior Infrastructure/DevOps Engineer</h2>      <h4>Posted Jan 23</h4>    <h3>      <span>Logikcull</span><br>      <span>Headquarters: San Francisco (or Remote) </span><br>        <a href='https://logikcull.com/jobs/#open-positions' rel='nofollow'>https://logikcull.com/jobs/#open-positions</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>Logikcull might be the most interesting company you haven’t heard of - yet. You probably use Dropbox or a similar service on a daily basis. Now imagine a service where customers upload entire email databases, nested zip files, images in every conceivable format (and some inconceivable), hard drive exports, and other content described as “anything and everything.” Logikcull customers need to understand this data quickly and thoroughly. Simple enough. Put it in S3, right? But here’s the catch, unlike Dropbox, Logikcull must rip the data apart, analyze metadata and text and then restructure it so that legal teams around the world can navigate complex discovery matters. Existing discovery solutions are tired and insufficient. Logikcull is truly something different.</div><div><br></div><div>This of course requires massive computing, storage, and supporting infrastructure that will surely feel small 6 months from now. Our technical challenges are both broad and deep. Emails have attachments and exist in threaded conversations. A Word document might be a simple letter or embed presentations or even entire email archives (yep, seen it) Almost anything can be printed to PDF.</div><div><br></div><div>Logikcull is a complex web application that sits on top of a distributed document processing pipeline that handles millions of documents and multiple terabytes of data each month. Current customer growth trends mean we have some serious infrastructure work ahead of us. You are important because we need help on multiple fronts. We must expand document processing capacity and performance, increase system reliability, and improve our security posture. Customers in 34 different countries (and counting) are depending on us.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>It’s controlled chaos at scale and we love it. Here’s why:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The technical challenges are staggering, but the potential impact even small changes can have is incredibly motivating. Last month we shaved 8.5 seconds off of an important document processing step. Multiply that by 10’s of millions of documents and the impact is enormous. Engineers will find opportunities like this over and over.</div><div><br></div><div>The impact Logikcull is having on our society is likely even more rewarding. For example, our government customers are now responding to open records requests (i.e. FOIA), in days, not months or years (yep, not kidding) by using Logikcull. Citizens lawfully requesting and receiving government information in a timely fashion is crucial for our democracy. We’re committed to making this process better every day.</div><div><br></div><div>Similarly, we’re committed to changing the economics and logistics of discovery in litigation, which is often prohibitively expensive and complicated for those who need it the most. Logikcull makes it easy, fast, and affordable for anyone to participate in the discovery process. To us, litigation is sometimes required to affect positive change (<a href='http://logikcull.com/blog/into-the-wild-earthjustice-amanda-sharp/' rel='nofollow'>see this blog post about how Logikcull helped to save an endangered species of wolves, not a joke</a>) Discovery should not be weaponized.
