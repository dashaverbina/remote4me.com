Social trading takes the activity of &quot;investing&quot; -- which previously happened only&nbsp;in private, like some kind of embarrassing biological process&nbsp;-- and brings it out into the sunshine so that other people can watch and benefit.</p><p>On Collective2's web site, you can find traders and investors that you like and admire, and follow along with them in your own brokerage account. Alternately, if you're a good trader, you can attract followers (and earn extra money doing so).</p><p>So Collective2's business touches a lot of interesting areas: finance, trading, automation, algorithms, big-data, risk analysis.</p><p><strong>Remote Only</strong></p><p>Collective2 is a &quot;distributed&quot; company - no central office, no cubicles, no pointy-headed managers. We are a team of men and women working together, full-time, from homes and coworking facilities all over the world.</p><p>We are a small company. We try to keep things on a human (and humane) scale. No politics, no corporate B.S.</p><p>Because we are small, every software developer has tremendous responsibility. We'll keep you challenged and happy.</p><p>And finally:</p><p>Be honest with yourself. The idea of working remotely sounds appealing, but it drives some percentage of the population bat-shit crazy. If you need proximity to warm human flesh, a foosball table, or a communal water cooler, this position probably isn't&nbsp;for you.
