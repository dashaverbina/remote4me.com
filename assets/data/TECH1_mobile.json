We help bring new knowledge to people around the world, lower barriers to participation, and make it easier for everyone to share what they know. We do this by keeping the Wikimedia projects fast, secure, and available to all, protecting the values and policies that allow free knowledge projects like Wikipedia to thrive, building new features and tools to make it easy to read, edit, and share from the Wikimedia sites, and by supporting the communities of volunteers who make the projects possible.</p><p>At the Foundation, we build technology to help people everywhere access Wikipedia, across devices and in nearly 300 languages. We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia. Roughly a quarter of our budget goes to supporting the community that make the site possible, including through&nbsp;grantmaking programs&nbsp;that enable volunteers and enrich the information on the sites.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage people with a diverse range of backgrounds to apply.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully paid premiums for medical, dental &amp; vision insurance premiums                            </div>                            <div>                                 401(k) with 4% matching contribution                            </div>                            <div>                                 7-12 weeks parental leave with 100% pay + lactation room                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wellness Program ($1800 annual) to promote wellness &amp; personal growth                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pre-tax savings plans for Transportation &amp; Parking                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible work schedules and remote working options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pet Friendly office                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commitment to diversity &amp; inclusion throughout the employee lifecycle                            </div>                            <div>                                 12 days vacation, 19 days holiday, 2 days volunteer work and more!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Lean more at https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Work_with_us                            </div>                    ",

    "title": "Very: Senior Software Engineer JavaScript",
    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Remote or Chattanooga, TN)</strong> </p><p>Interviewing for a new company is a serious time commitment for all parties involved. Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in the continental U.S. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.</p><p><strong>Why We Started Very</strong></p><p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is to become the best IoT, blockchain, and machine learning product development shop in the world. We do this by hiring the best and investing heavily in them, both personally and professionally.</p><p><strong>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</strong></p><p>About 30% of our team works out of our HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. We consider ourselves best-practitioners of the remote-first movement and believe a great team shouldn’t be restricted by geography.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p><p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions. We are focusing heavily on building out products that have applications in one of the three following areas: 1) data science &amp; machine learning, 2) Internet of Things, and 3) blockchain. We’ve found that in each of these areas, the use of the underlying technology will drive the development of the core services , but that 75% of the work often still lives in the realm of modern web development.</p><p>At Very, there is a never ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend 80% of your week (Monday through Thursday) designing and building a product or platform for one of our clients. The other 20% of your week (Friday) will be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools / platforms:</p><ul><li><p>React &amp; React Native</p></li><li><p>Swift &amp; Objective C</p></li><li><p>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</p></li><li><p>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</p></li><li><p>Ethereum / Solidity</p></li><li><p>Ruby on Rails</p></li><li><p>Python</p></li><li><p>Pandas</p></li><li><p>Serverless</p></li><li><p>AWS (and a dash of Heroku where it makes sense)</p></li></ul><p>Given that we work on quite a bit of greenfield projects, there is often room to experiment with new patterns and tools (within reason). We don’t expect applicants to know our entire toolchain, but rather to be capable, flexible, and self-directed.</p><p><strong>This Role: Senior Software Engineer // Javascript</strong></p><p>Over the past few years, we’ve seen client-side engineering emerge as its own discipline, and we are looking for individuals who thrive in the front end and want to further their practice. Ideal candidates not only have a solid engineering background, but a passion for client-side development as well.</p><p>We value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineers to be as good of practitioners as they are leaders and teachers.</p><p><strong>How We Operate</strong></p><p>We are believers in transparency and openness. In terms of organizational structure and governance, we are a <a href='http://www.holacracy.org/' rel='nofollow'>holacracy</a>. It’s worked pretty well for the us the last few years. When it comes to development processes, we do our best to adhere as closely to <a href='http://www.extremeprogramming.org/' rel='nofollow'>Extreme Programming</a> as possible. We believe in hiring capable, responsible professionals. We don’t micromanage and trust everyone to work hard, experiment, learn from their mistakes, and contribute to each other and the company in a sustainable manner. We have no venture funding or external investors, which affords us the ability to be nimble and run our company in the best interest of our team as a whole.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p><p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $135,000 upon joining the company. We have many health plans available through UHC—prices and plans vary based on your region—as well as vision and dental. We currently contribute a large portion to each plan, again, amounts vary based on region. As an added benefit, Very provides 1X Earnings Basic Life &amp; AD&amp;D. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a 2% match on after a few months working with us. Lastly, 35% of the company’s ownership is reserved for a team member options pool.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in the continental United States. Thanks!To apply, please send us a note to jobs-aj@verypossible.com with &quot;Senior Software Engineer -- Javascript&quot; in the subject line. Please include the following:1. What’s most important to you from a company culture and operating environment?2.

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more, and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out.</p><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand distraction-free for multiple hours totally.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><p>We have partial test coverage, and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each release.</p><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><p>Developers get the super fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><p>If you did follow directions, our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code, and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><p>If we like your refactoring, we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. Nothing super in-depth CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard, you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><p><strong>Want more detail about the benefits?</strong></p><p>You can see a preview of TrainerRoad's health benefits here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27' rel='nofollow'>https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27</a></p><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><p>Right now!

People don’t approach Art+Logic to churn out routine apps; they come because they have something hard, often requiring research and skilled implementation.&nbsp;There is no better place than Art+Logic for software developers to do what they love — and also better hone their craft.</em>”</p><p><br>Job Type: 1099, rates ranging $35-$50/hour<br>Travel: None Required - Work from Home<br>Location: United States and Canada only</p><p><strong>Find out more at:</strong></p><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://plus.google.coj/+ArtAndLogic' rel='nofollow'>https://plus.google.com/+ArtAndLogic</a></li><li><a href='http://www.artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>http://www.artandlogic.com/careers/</a></li></ul></ul><p><strong>Have more questions?</strong>&nbsp;Email us at <a href='mailto:Recruiting@artandlogic.com' rel='nofollow'>Recruiting@artandlogic.com</a></p><p>Some things are best said multiple times. <strong>Please note&nbsp;your interest in this specific position, when applying.&nbsp;</strong>(You can do so&nbsp;in the &quot;Brag&quot; section.)</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Annual Conference                            </div>                    ",

Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.</p><p>We don’t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it’s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it’s all open for anyone to suggest.</p><p><strong>OUR ENGINEERING VALUES</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Move smart</strong>: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).</li><li><strong>Distribute knowledge</strong>: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.</li><li><strong>Leave code better than you found it</strong>: because we constantly raise the bar.</li><li><strong>Unity makes strength</strong>: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.</li><li><strong>Always improve</strong>: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you’ve done.</li></ul><p><strong>MOBILE AT HEETCH</strong></p><p>Our app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for a great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: we are passionate about software architecture. We’ve built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough that we’ll be able to push forward what doing mobile programming means and we’ll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p><ul><li>Build new exciting features.</li><li>Solve challenging real-time synchronization problems.</li><li>Build a robust &amp; modern in-house framework, that will serve our app for next 4 years</li><li>Practise continuous refactoring and unit testing to constantly improve the codebase.</li><li>Create custom UI components (with Playground Driven Development)</li><li>Work on our great shiny redesign of the app.</li><li>Experimenting with various concepts (Coordinators/Flows, ReSwift)</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Great oral and written communication skills.</li><li>Speaking both French and English at a conversational level</li><li>At least 4-5 years of experience with both Objective C and Swift in production environments.</li><li>Experience with creating and supporting a widely used app</li><li>Strong mobile development culture.</li><li>You know how to make integration testing less painful (XCTests, FBSnapshots).</li><li>Strong understanding of the iOS SDK (UIKit, MapKit).</li><li>Ability to thrive in a startup environment.</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS POINTS</strong></p><ul><li>Contributions to open source projects.</li><li>Experience with RxSwift.</li></ul><p><strong>PERKS</strong></p><ul><li>Permanent contract</li><li>Stock.</li><li>Paid conference attendance/travel and periodic team meetups.</li><li>Heetch credits.</li><li>A Spotify subscription.</li><li>Work from anywhere you want.</li></ul>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Full remote (in Europe only) and flexible ways of working                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid conferences attendance/travel                            </div>                            <div>                                 Periodic team meetups                            </div>                            <div>                                 Stocks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Heetch credits                            </div>                    ",

We horen graag van je waarom je van programmeren en/of Android houdt, waarom jij dit doet en hoe je denkt ons te kunnen helpen met onze Android projecten.</p><p>Wij zijn een remote team wat betekent dat je veelal vanuit huis zult werken. Uiteraard bezoek je regelmatig een klant, en 1 keer in de 2 weken hebben we een gezamelijke 'coworking' day.

Op een enkele uitzondering na worden&nbsp;onze apps native ontwikkeld.</p><p>Ondanks dat we remote werken zijn we een hecht team.

That’s why Mixtiles relies heavily on software. Our product is affordable because software automates our factory. Our marketing scales because software collects tons of data from various sources and aggregates it into actionable dashboards. Our customers love how we communicate with them because software automates tons of the emails we’re sending in a smart way. Our backend controls almost every aspect of the company, it has a huge influence over everything we do.</p><p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p><p>You will own the backend. You’ll make the API amazing for the iOS and Android devs. You’ll improve our customer services interface, make our responses better and faster. You’ll improve the way our factory works, and enable our expansion to new countries. A lot of our decisions are based on data, you’ll collect that data and crunch it so our CEO and VPs could guide the ship to the right direction. We don’t do bureaucracy or politics. If you’re fast, you’ll fly.</p><p><strong>Who should you be?</strong></p><p>You’re a fast, smart coder with an eye for simplicity. You’ve been writing code for more than 5 years. You’re super fun to talk to, and people frequently feel they’ve learned something after talking to you. You’re passionate about software development and are constantly open to new paradigms and ideas. You care about quality and testing, but don’t go overboard. You’re responsible and understand that if the backend crashes, so do most of the company’s operations. You speak good English. You’re a good person that believes in the good of others.

Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.<br> <br>We don’t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it’s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it’s all open for anyone to suggest.<br> <br>OUR ENGINEERING VALUES<br>• Move smart: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).<br>• Distribute knowledge: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.<br>• Leave code better than you found it: because we constantly raise the bar.<br>• Unity makes strength: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.<br>• Always improve: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you’ve done.<br> <br>MOBILE AT HEETCH<br>Our app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.<br> <br>Network and GPS management: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.<br>UI &amp; UX: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for a great user experience.<br>One way data flow and functional pattern: we are passionate about software architecture. We’ve built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough that we’ll be able to push forward what doing mobile programming means and we’ll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.<br> <br>WHAT YOU’LL DO<br>• Build new exciting features.<br>• Solve challenging real-time synchronization problems.<br>• Build a robust &amp; modern in-house framework, that will serve our app for next 4 years<br>• Practise continuous refactoring and unit testing to constantly improve the codebase.<br>• Create custom UI components (with Playground Driven Development)<br>• Work on our great shiny redesign of the app.<br>• Experimenting with various concepts (Coordinators/Flows, ReSwift)</p><p>REQUIREMENTS<br>• Great oral and written communication skills.<br>• At least 3-4 years of experience with both Objective C and Swift in production environments.<br>• Strong mobile development culture.<br>• You know how to make integration testing less painful (XCTests, FBSnapshots).<br>• Strong understanding of the iOS SDK (UIKit, MapKit).<br>• Ability to thrive in a startup environment.</p><p>BONUS POINTS<br>• Contributions to open source projects.<br>• Experience with RxSwift.<br> <br>PERKS<br>• Permanent contract (CDI).<br>• Stock.<br>• Paid conference attendance/travel and periodic team meetups.<br>• Heetch credits.</p></div>",
