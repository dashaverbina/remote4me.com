The ideal candidate&nbsp;is a &quot;developer's developer&quot; and enjoys reading about programming in their free time, tinkering on the weekends with side projects and staying abreast of the latest frameworks/technologies in their area of expertise.</p><p>We want someone with a passion for development.</p><p><strong>Required Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>C# Experience - Intermediate to Advanced&nbsp;proficiency</li></ul><p><strong>Optional Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>Xamarin</li><li>ASP.net MVC</li><li>LINQ</li><li>Web API</li><li>Azure</li><li>SQL</li><li>Build/Test CI (We use TeamCity)</li></ul><p><strong>Work Remote or in Reno, Nevada</strong></p><p>We're looking for the best candidate we can find in the US. Over half of our development&nbsp;team works remotely. It works very well with the help of Slack and Github.</p><p>We expect remote employees&nbsp;to overlap at least 6 hours with the Reno, Nevada office (we're there 8am-5pm Pacific time).</p><p><strong>Salary</strong></p><p>We're looking to hire engineers for&nbsp;100k/year. &nbsp;If you ask for more we'll reject your application.

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><p>You can download the refactoring exercise here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0' rel='nofollow'>https://www.dropbox.com/s/95pt8m84znr1jf7/bike-distributor-refactor.zip?dl=0</a></p><p>It has a readme.txt in it with instructions.</p><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user let us know!</p><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more, and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out.</p><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand distraction-free for multiple hours totally.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><p>We have partial test coverage, and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each release.</p><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><p>We often pair program via Screen Hero.</p><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><p>Developers get the super fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive we want to spend the money on it.</p><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><p>If you did follow directions, our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code, and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><p>If we like your refactoring, we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. Nothing super in-depth CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and our CTO. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard, you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><p><strong>Want more detail about the benefits?</strong></p><p>You can see a preview of TrainerRoad's health benefits here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27' rel='nofollow'>https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27</a></p><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><p>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Trainer Road, LLC            </h2>            <div><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive Pay</li><li>Unlimited Vacation</li><li>401k with 4% company matching&nbsp;</li><li>99% of employees individual health care paid</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>Access to the latest fitness devices (power meters, trainers, sensors, etc.)</li></ul>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Unlimited Vacation                            </div>                            <div>                                 99% of Employee Health Insurance Paid                            </div>                            <div>                                 Fitness Minded Culture                            </div>                            <div>                                 401k with 4% matching                            </div>                    ",

Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.</p><p>We don’t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it’s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it’s all open for anyone to suggest.</p><p><strong>OUR ENGINEERING VALUES</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Move smart</strong>: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).</li><li><strong>Distribute knowledge</strong>: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.</li><li><strong>Leave code better than you found it</strong>: because we constantly raise the bar.</li><li><strong>Unity makes strength</strong>: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.</li><li><strong>Always improve</strong>: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you’ve done.</li></ul><p><strong>MOBILE AT HEETCH</strong></p><p>Our app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design.

That’s why Mixtiles relies heavily on software. Our product is affordable because software automates our factory. Our marketing scales because software collects tons of data from various sources and aggregates it into actionable dashboards. Our customers love how we communicate with them because software automates tons of the emails we’re sending in a smart way. Our backend controls almost every aspect of the company, it has a huge influence over everything we do.</p><p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p><p>You will own the backend. You’ll make the API amazing for the iOS and Android devs. You’ll improve our customer services interface, make our responses better and faster. You’ll improve the way our factory works, and enable our expansion to new countries. A lot of our decisions are based on data, you’ll collect that data and crunch it so our CEO and VPs could guide the ship to the right direction. We don’t do bureaucracy or politics. If you’re fast, you’ll fly.</p><p><strong>Who should you be?</strong></p><p>You’re a fast, smart coder with an eye for simplicity. You’ve been writing code for more than 5 years. You’re super fun to talk to, and people frequently feel they’ve learned something after talking to you. You’re passionate about software development and are constantly open to new paradigms and ideas. You care about quality and testing, but don’t go overboard. You’re responsible and understand that if the backend crashes, so do most of the company’s operations. You speak good English. You’re a good person that believes in the good of others. We'll put together an offer based on your skill and experience. It will be the best offer you'll get. We take quality very seriously, and we're willing to pay for great people when we find them. You'll work from home. (Or we'll rent some office space for you if you prefer that.) It's an exciting time for Mixtiles. We're pumped to read your application, and hope to have you on board.</p>                    </div>                            <h2>                About Mixtiles            </h2>            <div><p><strong>What is Mixtiles?</strong></p><p>We’re helping people put photos on walls.

Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.<br> <br>We don’t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it’s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it’s all open for anyone to suggest.<br> <br>OUR ENGINEERING VALUES<br>• Move smart: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).<br>• Distribute knowledge: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.<br>• Leave code better than you found it: because we constantly raise the bar.<br>• Unity makes strength: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.<br>• Always improve: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you’ve done.<br> <br>MOBILE AT HEETCH<br>Our app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.<br> <br>Network and GPS management: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.<br>UI &amp; UX: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for a great user experience.<br>One way data flow and functional pattern: we are passionate about software architecture. We’ve built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough that we’ll be able to push forward what doing mobile programming means and we’ll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.<br> <br>WHAT YOU’LL DO<br>• Build new exciting features.<br>• Solve challenging real-time synchronization problems.<br>• Build a robust &amp; modern in-house framework, that will serve our app for next 4 years<br>• Practise continuous refactoring and unit testing to constantly improve the codebase.<br>• Create custom UI components (with Playground Driven Development)<br>• Work on our great shiny redesign of the app.<br>• Experimenting with various concepts (Coordinators/Flows, ReSwift)</p><p>REQUIREMENTS<br>• Great oral and written communication skills.<br>• At least 3-4 years of experience with both Objective C and Swift in production environments.<br>• Strong mobile development culture.<br>• You know how to make integration testing less painful (XCTests, FBSnapshots).<br>• Strong understanding of the iOS SDK (UIKit, MapKit).<br>• Ability to thrive in a startup environment.</p><p>BONUS POINTS<br>• Contributions to open source projects.<br>• Experience with RxSwift.<br> <br>PERKS<br>• Permanent contract (CDI).<br>• Stock.<br>• Paid conference attendance/travel and periodic team meetups.<br>• Heetch credits.</p></div>",

Our vision is to decentralize banking and bring the power of financial services to everyone in the world, including the nearly 2 billion adults that to this day remain unbanked.</p><p><strong>Android At Bread</strong></p><p>Android is a first class citizen at Bread. As our fastest growing platform, Android is core to our business at Bread. With the release of our redesign, our Android app is fully up to speed with our product release schedule and new features are pushed at the same time as our iOS app.</p><p>We're committed to building one of the best Android apps out there, not just the best wallet or crypto currency app. Our goal is to expand our Android customer base to meet or exceed that of our iOS app so we can bring the safety and security of our app model to millions of Android customers.</p><p>Our Android engineers get the unique advantage of being able to target devices that support Marshmallow or newer, streamlining the developer experience, and cutting out a lot of backward compatibility cruft typical of Android development.</p><p><strong>What we're doing at Bread</strong></p><p>Bread is at the heart of a financial revolution. We're building the missing piece of infrastructure that ties together the essential functionality of a bank, but where individuals retain complete control over their assets. As a a financial infrastructure company, our mission is unlikely to ever be complete. We need continually strive to bring the power of our apps to new regions of the world, some of which have never had wide access to banking functionality.</p><p>Our approach to this problem heavily focuses on several core tenants. For one, we will never have direct control or visibility over customer funds. It is not our job to interfere in the personal financial lives of our customers. This is accomplished by using digital assets like Bitcoin, and a mobile app like ours which manages its assets on-device.</p><p>The second tenant of our approach is to provide integration with the traditional financial system. Regardless of the currency, people still need to get paid, pay their bills, pay for goods at merchants, and send money to their family and friends. We are building infrastructure that integrates with local financial businesses that tie in with local currencies and adhere to local laws.</p><p>Finally, we need to fight for a quality consumer experience. This is why we try to retain control over every moment of our customer's interaction with our products. We relentlessly design, redesign, test, and experiment to ensure our customers have a positive, safe experience.</p><p><strong>What it's like to work here</strong></p><p>We've built a lively remote work culture that emphasizes regular personal interaction. At Bread, we started as a remote team and have built our workflows around it. This allows us to hire people who want to work with us, regardless of where they've decided to settle (or roam). </p><p>Work-life balance is important to everyone at Bread, and we strive to ensure everyone has enough time for family, exercise, and mental health.

    "content": "<h2>              Senior iOS Engineer<small> @ Bread</small>          </h2><dl>          <dt></dt>          <dd><p></p></dd>          <dt></dt>          <dd><p>2018-01-08 03:42</p></dd>          <dt><span>Description</span></dt>          <dd><p>We are looking for an experienced iOS engineer to join our mobile team to help us build the best crypto currency experience in the world. Our vision is to decentralize banking and bring the power of financial services to everyone in the world, including the nearly 2 billion adults that to this day remain unbanked.</p><p><strong>iOS at Bread</strong></p><p>Bread started out on iOS so the Apple ecosystem is in our blood. Originally, our entire Bitcoin stack was written from scratch in Objective-C. We've since evolved our business and product significantly, however iOS remains core to our ability to execute on our vision. We're not a mobile-first company, we're mobile-only. Our mobile apps are the only way our customers interact with Bread, so we take great pride in our apps.</p><p>The Bread app on iOS is responsible for securing billions of USD worth of digital assets, and that number continues to grow every day. We're growing our iOS team so we can expand our product portfolio and support our rapidly growing iOS customer base.</p><p><strong>What we're doing at Bread</strong></p><p>Bread is at the heart of a financial revolution. We're building the missing piece of infrastructure that ties together the essential functionality of a bank, but where individuals retain complete control over their assets. As a a financial infrastructure company, our mission is unlikely to ever be complete. We need continually strive to bring the power of our apps to new regions of the world, some of which have never had wide access to banking functionality.</p><p>Our approach to this problem heavily focuses on several core tenants. For one, we will never have direct control or visibility over customer funds. It is not our job to interfere in the personal financial lives of our customers. This is accomplished by using digital assets like Bitcoin, and a mobile app like ours which manages its assets on-device.</p><p>The second tenant of our approach is to provide integration with the traditional financial system. Regardless of the currency, people still need to get paid, pay their bills, pay for goods at merchants, and send money to their family and friends. We are building infrastructure that integrates with local financial businesses that tie in with local currencies and adhere to local laws.</p><p>Finally, we need to fight for a quality consumer experience. This is why we try to retain control over every moment of our customer's interaction with our products. We relentlessly design, redesign, test, and experiment to ensure our customers have a positive, safe experience.</p><p><strong>What it's like to work here</strong></p><p>We've built a lively remote work culture that emphasizes regular personal interaction. At Bread, we started as a remote team and have built our workflows around it. This allows us to hire people who want to work with us, regardless of where they've decided to settle (or roam). </p><p>Work-life balance is important to everyone at Bread, and we strive to ensure everyone has enough time for family, exercise, and mental health. In our opinion, a happy and healthy team is an essential ingredient to finding creative solutions to the hard problems we're trying to solve.</p><p>We're more operationally transparent than you may be used to.

    "content": "<p>What is Mixtiles?</p><p>We’re helping people put photos on walls. Canvas prints and framed photos are OLD products that haven’t seen innovation in years. We’re using software, industrial design and operational excellence to re-design the entire experience, starting from your phone. Check out our apps (iOS, Android) and our video!</p><p>Our Backend</p><p>We believe that in business, being amazing in software development creates huge advantages. That’s why Mixtiles relies heavily on software. Our product is affordable because software automates our factory. Our marketing scales because software collects tons of data from various sources and aggregates it into actionable dashboards. Our customers love how we communicate with them because software automates tons of the emails we’re sending in a smart way. Our backend controls almost every aspect of the company, it has a huge influence over everything we do.</p><p>What will you do?</p><p>You will own the backend. You’ll make the API amazing for the iOS and Android devs. You’ll improve our customer services interface, make our responses better and faster. You’ll improve the way our factory works, and enable our expansion to new countries. A lot of our decisions are based on data, you’ll collect that data and crunch it so our CEO and VPs could guide the ship to the right direction. We don’t do bureaucracy or politics. If you’re fast, you’ll fly.</p><p>Who should you be?</p><p>You’re a fast, smart coder with an eye for simplicity. You’ve been writing code for more than 5 years. You’re super fun to talk to, and people frequently feel they’ve learned something after talking to you. You’re passionate about software development and are constantly open to new paradigms and ideas. You care about quality and testing, but don’t go overboard. You’re responsible and understand that if the backend crashes, so do most of the company’s operations. You speak good English. You’re a good person that believes in the good of others.</p><p>We'll put together an offer based on your skill and experience. It will be the best offer you'll get. We take quality very seriously, and we're willing to pay for great people when we find them. You'll work from home. (Or we'll rent some office space for you if you prefer that.)</p><p>It's an exciting time for Mixtiles. We're pumped to read your application, and hope to have you on board.</p>",

Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.</p><p>How we work:<br>* Happy Customers &gt; Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be &quot;pure.&quot;<br>* Vision &gt; GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.<br>* Writing &gt; Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.</p><p>We're working on:<br>* Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe).<br>* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.<br>* Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.</p><p>We work in San Francisco but are absolutely open to remote engineers. We'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Interested? Apply here: <a href='https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer</a></p></div>",
