    "content": "<p>What is Mixtiles?</p><p>We’re helping people put photos on walls. Canvas prints and framed photos are OLD products that haven’t seen innovation in years. We’re using software, industrial design and operational excellence to re-design the entire experience, starting from your phone. Check out our apps (iOS, Android) and our video!</p><p>Our Backend</p><p>We believe that in business, being amazing in software development creates huge advantages. That’s why Mixtiles relies heavily on software. Our product is affordable because software automates our factory. Our marketing scales because software collects tons of data from various sources and aggregates it into actionable dashboards. Our customers love how we communicate with them because software automates tons of the emails we’re sending in a smart way. Our backend controls almost every aspect of the company, it has a huge influence over everything we do.</p><p>What will you do?</p><p>You will own the backend. You’ll make the API amazing for the iOS and Android devs. You’ll improve our customer services interface, make our responses better and faster. You’ll improve the way our factory works, and enable our expansion to new countries. A lot of our decisions are based on data, you’ll collect that data and crunch it so our CEO and VPs could guide the ship to the right direction. We don’t do bureaucracy or politics. If you’re fast, you’ll fly.</p><p>Who should you be?</p><p>You’re a fast, smart coder with an eye for simplicity. You’ve been writing code for more than 5 years. You’re super fun to talk to, and people frequently feel they’ve learned something after talking to you. You’re passionate about software development and are constantly open to new paradigms and ideas. You care about quality and testing, but don’t go overboard. You’re responsible and understand that if the backend crashes, so do most of the company’s operations. You speak good English. You’re a good person that believes in the good of others.</p><p>We'll put together an offer based on your skill and experience. It will be the best offer you'll get. We take quality very seriously, and we're willing to pay for great people when we find them. You'll work from home. (Or we'll rent some office space for you if you prefer that.)</p><p>It's an exciting time for Mixtiles. We're pumped to read your application, and hope to have you on board.</p>",

Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.</p><p>How we work:<br>* Happy Customers &gt; Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be &quot;pure.&quot;<br>* Vision &gt; GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.<br>* Writing &gt; Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.</p><p>We're working on:<br>* Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe).<br>* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.<br>* Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.</p><p>We work in San Francisco but are absolutely open to remote engineers. We'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Interested? Apply here: <a href='https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer</a></p></div>",

Our app is the centerpiece of the whole service, where drivers are able to get ride requests, where passengers are able to request rides, and where everyone is able to get in touch with us directly at anytime.</p><p>We don’t want to see our users open up Heetch just because we can get them from point A to point B, we want them to open the app because they feel like it was specifically built for them. We want to build upon our core service everything that would make every ride enjoyable. Whether it’s helping them put the music passengers want to listen to, help drivers find the right spots to go to and the right ride, give recommandations about places passengers would want to go, and it’s all open for anyone to suggest.</p><p><strong>OUR ENGINEERING VALUES</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Move smart</strong>: we are data driven, and employ tools and best practices to ship code quickly and safely (continuous integration, code review, automated testing, etc).</li><li><strong>Distribute knowledge</strong>: we want to scale our engineering team to a point where our contributions do not stop at the company code base. We believe in the Open Source culture and communication with the outside world.</li><li><strong>Leave code better than you found it</strong>: because we constantly raise the bar.</li><li><strong>Unity makes strength</strong>: moving people from A to B is not as easy as it sounds but, we always keep calm and support each other.</li><li><strong>Always improve</strong>: we value personal progress and want you to look back proudly on what you’ve done.</li></ul><p><strong>MOBILE AT HEETCH</strong></p><p>Our app is one of the few mobile apps that run in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: we need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, provide as accurate as possible GPS localisation for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for a great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: we are passionate about software architecture. We’ve built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough that we’ll be able to push forward what doing mobile programming means and we’ll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p><ul><li>Build new exciting features.</li><li>Solve challenging real-time synchronization problems.</li><li>Build a robust &amp; modern in-house framework, that will serve our app for next 4 years</li><li>Practise continuous refactoring and unit testing to constantly improve the codebase.</li><li>Create custom UI components (with Playground Driven Development)</li><li>Work on our great shiny redesign of the app.</li><li>Experimenting with various concepts (Coordinators/Flows, ReSwift)</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Great oral and written communication skills.</li><li>Speaking both French and English at a conversational level</li><li>At least 4-5 years of experience with both Objective C and Swift in production environments.</li><li>Experience with creating and supporting a widely used app</li><li>Strong mobile development culture.</li><li>You know how to make integration testing less painful (XCTests, FBSnapshots).</li><li>Strong understanding of the iOS SDK (UIKit, MapKit).</li><li>Ability to thrive in a startup environment.</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS POINTS</strong></p><ul><li>Contributions to open source projects.</li><li>Experience with RxSwift.</li></ul><p><strong>PERKS</strong></p><ul><li>Permanent contract</li><li>Stock.</li><li>Paid conference attendance/travel and periodic team meetups.</li><li>Heetch credits.</li><li>A Spotify subscription.</li><li>Work from anywhere you want.</li></ul>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Full remote (in Europe only) and flexible ways of working                            </div>                            <div>                                 Paid conferences attendance/travel                            </div>                            <div>                                 Periodic team meetups                            </div>                            <div>                                 Stocks                            </div>                            <div>                                 Heetch credits                            </div>                    ",

Depending on experience, location and interest in the project this could be some combination of room / flights / $ / equity. If you want to work remotely or work on a contract basis then we can discuss exact specifications for a few features that we need right now. </p><p>We will be working from Hokkaido, Japan Feb 20 - March 25 2017 in a ski chalet ten minutes from world class power. We try to do mornings on the hill any days with fresh powder (most days in Hokkaido) then work through the rest of the day. You are welcome to join for any part of this time.</p><p>If the fit is good then this could absolutely grow into an ongoing relationship. The team is based in Bali and Melbourne right now (with frequent trips back and forth) and we are open to remote work.</p><p>If iOS is your skill set then this would be about adding features (detailed specs ready now). If Android is your area of expertise then we would look at creating a React Native version for  Android / web. We have a skilled back-end engineer so your work would be primarily front-end.</p><p>Please have a play with the app and then send me a message:<br><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/heyo-inspiring-human-connections/id1108737147/' rel='nofollow'>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/heyo-inspiring-human-connections/id1108737147/</a></p></div>",
