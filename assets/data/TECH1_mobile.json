Since you are the first person who has a dedicated QA role, being&nbsp;creative about what to test is important to us, as well as being organized about how you will structure and otherwise write and maintain&nbsp;tests.&nbsp;Communicating frequently, abundantly, clearly, and empathetically are also core skills for this position.&nbsp;A good eye for things that look strange also helps!</p><p>Third Iron is a remote-first company. Everyone contributes remotely, whether software developer, customer support, or sales. We stay tightly in step with the needs of our customers - researchers and librarians - to help them browse, read, discover, and organize scholarly information.</p><p><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Writing test procedures</li><li>Managing test procedures and results&nbsp;alongside our JIRA issues for new features, bugs, etc.</li><li>Testing our software in an exploratory manner to find&nbsp;bugs that slip by the automated tests we write&nbsp;during development</li><li>Working together with the dev team to figure out what to test and to ensure you get test results to developers in a timely fashion</li></ul><p>You will be helping test&nbsp;multiple web apps, including&nbsp;<a href='https://browzine.com' rel='nofollow'>browzine.com</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;and BrowZine's associated&nbsp;native&nbsp;iOS and Android apps.</p><p>Our software is written in a variety of technologies, but the ones you'll come into contact with the most are built using&nbsp;Javascript (usually NodeJS or Ember), Postgres, Swift&nbsp;/&nbsp;Objective-C, and Java.

Some of the testing will involve the UNIX command line, in addition to a variety of clicking in web browsers and tapping on Android and iOS devices.</p><p>Being a self-motivated tester&nbsp;who can work independently is important for remote work in general, and on our team.</p><p>A&nbsp;strong desire to learn new technologies is something our teammates share.&nbsp;We want to embrace the tools and techniques that help us build great software and let us sleep soundly at night, knowing our users are having a delightful experience and our servers are not catching fire.</p><p>When applying,&nbsp;please include anything that helps demonstrate your testing and quality assurance&nbsp;abilities, such as articles or blog posts you've written, bug reports on open source projects, or anything else you can share that is indicative of how you best contribute to a team.</p><p>We are currently taking applications from people with US work authorizations.</p><p>Please do not apply if you are a software development firm looking to hire out a team of your developers; we are interested in a single full-time candidate.</p><p><strong>About Third Iron</strong></p><p>Third Iron, founded in 2011 as a remote-first software development company, creates innovative library technologies to help academic libraries and the researchers they support.

We have lots of ideas for cool projects to do around Snowplow - and if you have any suggestions of your own, we would love to hear them!</p><p>This is a paid internship; we will consider remote candidates who are up to UTC +/- 5 hours maximum. Most of our engineering team works remotely so you certainly won’t be the only one!</p><p><strong>Does this sound like you?</strong></p><p>A Snowplow intern loves coding, enjoys experimenting with new technologies and is happiest working “in the open” on community/team projects. In terms of programming languages, we’ be particularly interested in hearing from you if you love Scala or have experience with big data frameworks.</p><p>However, our stack consists of Scala, Golang, JavaScript, Objective-C, C#, Java, Python - so, whatever languages you like working in, we can probably find something interesting for you to do. Technologies and tools we use at Snowplow include Spark, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Kinesis and Redshift.</p><p><strong>To apply</strong></p><p>If you’re interested, please send in your CV along with a summary about a piece of software you are proud to have written.<strong>Here are some do’s for your application:</strong></p><ul><li>Do tell us a little bit about yourself - what you are passionate about, what you are looking for in an internship</li><li>Do share any public profiles or contributions you have on open-source, libre or community projects</li><li>Do share links to publically available code written by you (perhaps something on GitHub or Bitbucket?)</li><li>Do suggest specific projects/initiatives/features that you would like to work on in your internship (it’s okay if you don’t know!)</li></ul><p><strong>Some don’ts:</strong></p><ul><li>Please don’t share any proprietary or commercial software with us</li><li>Please don’t attach any code to your application (but it’s okay to tell us about code that you&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;share later on)</li></ul><p>And that’s it!

We help bring new knowledge to people around the world, lower barriers to participation, and make it easier for everyone to share what they know. We do this by keeping the Wikimedia projects fast, secure, and available to all, protecting the values and policies that allow free knowledge projects like Wikipedia to thrive, building new features and tools to make it easy to read, edit, and share from the Wikimedia sites, and by supporting the communities of volunteers who make the projects possible.</p><p>At the Foundation, we build technology to help people everywhere access Wikipedia, across devices and in nearly 300 languages. We engineer privacy for our readers and editors so they can safely and securely explore Wikipedia. We create&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and initiatives to make Wikipedia freely available to more people in more parts of the world. We build&nbsp;new tools&nbsp;for the community of editors so they can continue to improve and grow Wikipedia. Roughly a quarter of our budget goes to supporting the community that make the site possible, including through&nbsp;grantmaking programs&nbsp;that enable volunteers and enrich the information on the sites.</p><p>The Wikimedia Foundation is an equal opportunity employer, and we encourage people with a diverse range of backgrounds to apply.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Fully paid premiums for medical, dental &amp; vision insurance premiums                            </div>                            <div>                                 401(k) with 4% matching contribution                            </div>                            <div>                                 7-12 weeks parental leave with 100% pay + lactation room                            </div>                            <div>                                 Wellness Program ($1800 annual) to promote wellness &amp; personal growth                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pre-tax savings plans for Transportation &amp; Parking                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible work schedules and remote working options                            </div>                            <div>                                 Pet Friendly office                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commitment to diversity &amp; inclusion throughout the employee lifecycle                            </div>                            <div>                                 12 days vacation, 19 days holiday, 2 days volunteer work and more!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Lean more at https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Work_with_us                            </div>                    ",

You’ve got 5 or more years of experience, and can point to multiple applications you have helped ship. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will. </span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4><b>A Bit About Us</b></h4></div><div><br></div><div>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'><span> </span><span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span> has to really </span><em>click</em><span> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Who you’d be working with:</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our developer team is 12 people strong, but we all work pretty closely. For that matter, we also work in cross-functional teams frequently so you'll get to work with people in all different roles in the company. As a small sampling though, here are a few that you'll definitely rub digital shoulders with: </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Taylor</b></span><span>, our CTO, was our digital nomad for a couple of years while he travelled...pretty much everywhere. He's now slowing down a bit and lives in Austin Texas, where he's learning to flex his handyman muscles while renovating their home. He's exceptionally good at </span><a href='https://theescapegameaustin.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>escape room games</span></a><span> and his super skill is explaining the rules of a board game in the most concise and understandable way you've ever heard. He also </span><em>wins</em><span> a lot of those boardgames. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Sebastian</b></span><span>, our mobile lead developer, works mostly on the iOS side of things here at YNAB. When he's not busy at YNAB he's either out walking the dogs, pretending to be a firefighter, feeding the cats or playing with his new server rack in the barn. He lives in rural Switzerland which might explain the barn - and by rural we mean it'd take you an hour to get to Zurich.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Graham</b></span><span>, our Android tech lead, is on a mission to convert everything to RxJava and Kotlin, and is constantly dabbling with various architecture patterns and solutions for cross-platform code-sharing. He lives in Scotland, where he hopes to one day be a decent enough guitarist to play a tune and actually have someone recognize it.</span></div><div><span>He's an aviation geek who obsessively binge-watches entire seasons of Air Crash Investigations, just in case it might come in useful someday.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4><b>How You'll Work at YNAB</b></h4></div><div><br></div><div><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span><b>Live Where You Want</b></span></h4></div><div><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span><b>No Crazy Hours</b></span></h4></div><div><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span><b>Take Vacation (Seriously)</b></span></h4></div><div><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span><em>minimum</em><span> vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span><b>The YNAB Retreat</b></span></h4></div><div><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span> in the mountains, and a beach house in the Outer Banks. This year is a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span><b>Up Your Game</b></span></h4></div><div><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!).. Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span><b>If You’re International...</b></span></h4></div><div><span>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. </span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><h4><span><b>If You’re Stateside…</b></span></h4></div><div><span>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span><em>and your family.</em><span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span><em>your retirement</em><span> </span><em>nest egg</em><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span><b>Other Tidbits</b></span></h4></div><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span><br></li><li><span>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span><br></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span><br></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span><br></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span><br></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</span><br><br></li></ul><div><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>You will change lives. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2><span><b>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</b></span></h2></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span>You're a mobile developer with over 5 years of experience. At least two of those have been spent working with either iOS or Android, or both. (If you have experience with only one, you’re excited to work with the other. We love both platforms for different reasons, and want you to as well.) &nbsp;You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You'll help us implement new features and maintain existing apps on both iOS and Android. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Lollipop on Android and iOS 9 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span><b>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</b></span></h4></div><ul><li><span>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</span><br></li><li><span>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</span><br></li><li><span>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</span><br></li><li><span>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:</span><br></li><li><span>&quot;This part of the program is too slow, and these are the places that might be good to start looking.&quot; &nbsp;</span><br></li><li><span>&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?&quot;</span><br></li><li><span>“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”</span></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>Have experience with:</li><li><span>Kotlin / Java</span></li><li>Or</li><li>Swift / Objective-C</li><li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</li><li>Are a <em>senior</em><span> developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div><h4><span><b>Bonus Points: </b></span></h4></div><ul><li><span>You already use and love YNAB. </span><br></li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Salary will be between $90k and $125k, depending on experience.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h2><span><b>How to Apply</b></span></h2></div><ul><li><span>Apply here (https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0fe95) by 11:59PM on March 25th, 2018.&nbsp;Firm.

He lives in rural Switzerland which might explain the barn - and by rural we mean it'd take you an hour to get to Zurich.</p><p>Graham, our Android tech lead, is on a mission to convert everything to RxJava and Kotlin, and is constantly dabbling with various architecture patterns and solutions for cross-platform code-sharing. He lives in Scotland, where he hopes to one day be a decent enough guitarist to play a tune and actually have someone recognize it.</p><p>He's an aviation geek who obsessively binge-watches entire seasons of Air Crash Investigations, just in case it might come in useful someday.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Live Where You Want.</strong>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours.</strong>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously).</strong>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong>The YNAB Retreat.</strong>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, and a beach house in the Outer Banks. This year is a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game.</strong>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!).. Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, books, dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.  </p><p><strong>If You’re International...</strong>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p><p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.  You will change lives. </p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</strong></p><p>You're a mobile developer with over 5 years of experience. At least two of those have been spent working with either iOS or Android, or both. (If you have experience with only one, you’re excited to work with the other. We love both platforms for different reasons, and want you to as well.)  You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.</p><p>You'll help us implement new features and maintain existing apps on both iOS and Android. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Lollipop on Android and iOS 9 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app.</p><p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:&quot;This part of the program is too slow, and these are the places that might be good to start looking.&quot;<br>&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?&quot;“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”</li><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>Have experience with:Kotlin / JavaOrSwift / Objective-C</li><li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</li><li>Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Point:</strong></p><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li></ul><p>Salary will be between $90k and $125k, depending on experience.</p><p>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</p><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><ul><li>Apply <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0fe95' rel='nofollow'>here</a> <strong>by 11:59PM on March 25th, 2018</strong>. Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li><li>Be sure to read the detailed application instructions on that page. </li></ul><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>P.S.  If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!</p>",

On the one side, we collect, combine and process various open data sources (such as OSM and Wikipedia) and turn raw data into easily accessible information and understandable products, such as our easy-to-use outdoor route planner.
