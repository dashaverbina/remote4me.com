We continue to grow at a fast rate, and are looking for more writers to add to our team to keep up the pace.</p><h2>What’s It Like Writing for Us?</h2><p>The work is highly varied, but there is always writing work available for our team of freelance writers.</p><p>One writer might produce a <a href=&quot;http://whoishostingthis.com/hosting-reviews/siteground/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>profle of a hosting company</a> on Monday, an introduction to the <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/c-sharp/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>C# programming language</a> on Wednesday, and a blog post about people <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2015/12/09/chatbots/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>falling in love with chatbots</a> on Friday.</p><p>If that mix sounds exciting, rather than terrifying, then maybe you are the right type of writer to join our team.</p><p>Our CEO is a former writer/editor, and understands the value of quality content.</p><h2>Job Requirements</h2><p>Our team of writers is varied. We have a grumpy physics PhD, an idealistic MBA with a side hustle in Hollywood, and a hyperactive former greyhound racing gambler <em>(or so he says)</em>. </p><p>We have wonderful writers that have worked for some of the world’s biggest websites. And we have exceptional people who only write for us.</p><p>We aren’t looking for clones. But everyone who works for us shares a handful of key attributes:</p><ul><li>Native English speaker with strong writing skills<br><em>(US English, although you can be based anywhere)</em>;</li><li>Exceptional online research skills;</li><li>Some degree of technical proficiency<br><em>(eg, two of our writers can code, most run websites/blogs)</em></li><li>Well organized &amp;  rock steady reliable;<br><em>(ie, deadlines get met on our team)</em></li><li>Working knowledge of HTML and WordPress</li><p><em>(Just the basics, nothing fancy.)</em></p></ul><li><h2>How Do We Work?</h2>You’ll be working as part of <a href=&quot;http://www.qualitynonsense.com/our-team/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>our remote team</a> located in dozens of countries around thw world. We use a few common tools to make that work:-<ul><li>Gmail</li><li>Google Docs</li><li>Asana</li><li>WordPress</li><li>Skype</li><li>Slack</li></ul><h2>What’s a Typical Project Like?</h2>We do a lot of different work. Check out our website, especially the <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>blog</a> and <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>resources</a> sections.</li><p>We are especially interested in people who can tackle very technical subjects, like resources on programming languages. A good example of this is our resource on the <a href=&quot;http://www.whoishostingthis.com/resources/forth-programming/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Forth programming language</a>.</p><p>Articles are often 1000+ words <em>(and we even have one 60,000 word FAQ!).</em> We are very clear on what we want on every project.</p><p>Most articles can be researched online. However, some will require expert interviews via Skype or phone <em>(we’ll cover costs)</em>.</p><h2>Workload</h2><p>We have as much work as you can handle. We have freelance writers producing as much as 10,000 words per week.  We are looking for writers available of a minimum of one day/week, due to the overhead of managing many writers.</p><p>We don’t micro-manage. We provide projects with descriptions including due dates and required length. There is sometimes communication back and forth <em>(Asana is great for this)</em>.</p><p>But mostly, you write the article and turn it in, we edit it and publish. Writers invoice every other week, and get paid in US dollars by PayPal or wire transfer.</p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> Please send an email to jobs@qualitynonsense.com with:-- A 4-5 sentence introduction explaining why you think you would be a good fit;- Three URLs showcasing your work related to the internet or technology.- Format your subject line as follows: Your Name | Freelance Writer    Example: Baza Naidoo | Freelance WriterGood luck!</p>",

Someone who is a self-starter, methodical, and detail oriented; someone who can ensure the little things won’t get missed.  In fact, we want someone who focuses on the minutiae.  A QA manual tester who enjoys focusing on specifics features, considering all the variations that are going to occur in the data and testing for that.<br /><br />This is a QA role for someone who enjoys working with big data sets in a MySQL database.  We need a QA Analyst who both loves to work in Agile and yet is flexible to adapting methodologies and introducing new techniques to ensure the best work is being done in the most timely manner. Someone who is accountable, and constantly researching, tweaking, and testing.<br /><br />This is a manual QA tester role, with an opportunity to dig deep and broaden your skills. If you are in a QA role within an enterprise organization, this is a chance to move into a start-up environment, and gain exposure to automation testing, business analyst work, and product development.  Someone who enjoys working in small teams, at a fast-pace, in one week sprints; jumping from discussions with product managers to developers.

You understand testing principles; and you know how to approach testing in a Java environment.<br />- Bonus points if you have a degree in Computer Science or Math.<br />- Nice to have, but not necessary is familiarity with Selenium, Webdriver, and Cucumber.<br />- Not intimidated by large data sets.  Our system is a very large data management system.  You have experience working with data centric applications systems and you are comfortable with MySQL (or similar technologies).<br />- Methodical, analytical, and detail oriented. You are a linear thinker; yet you are incredibly adept at thinking of all possible answers.  Your passion for math and solutions serves you in considering all of the variations that could occur in data and testing for that.<br />- An outstanding communicator. You have superior communication skills. You are concise, on point, and effective. You know how to listen and how to be heard.  You are able to communicate both user requirements and technical details clearly across the team.<br />- An innovative problem-solver.  You are flexible, but process-focused and you know how to balance urgency with long-term payoff. You are on a continuous search for improvements.

You will be responsible for entire features and will be a full member of the CareMessage Engineering team. Our team believes in an Agile development environment, test driven development. Our tools of choice are Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, PostgreSQL, and we place an emphasis on open collaboration and ownership. We're using Protractor for automated frontend testing so knowledge in that is a plus. When something isn’t working, we’re not afraid to throw it out and try something new - so if you have exciting ideas about the QA process and how to make your own job even easier, you’ll fit right in. All of our developers and QA engineers are working from a remote location.</p><p>Apply here: <a href=&quot;http://grnh.se/lt3wim&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>http://grnh.se/lt3wim</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                        </p></div></span></div>",
